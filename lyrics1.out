What'd you expect from me?
It's not my fault you'll never be happy
Just 'cause you're right doesn't mean I'm wrong
Our days were numbered and we knew it all along
Can't you let things be?
Now all that's left is misunderstandings
Spent my nights wishing I was gone
My dad was right, we will never get along

So I'm done, 'cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence, oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me

Can't you act your age?
Is it that hard to say what you're thinking?
Lately my life's moving way too fast
You'd drag me down if I'd let you hold me back
What a mess you've made
And you hide from it at the bars you frequent
Blamed myself avoiding time this cost
But looking back you only learn from what you lost

So I'm done, cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence, oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe you got the best of me

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
(Oh-oh oh-oh)
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time
(Ye-yeah)

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
(Oh-oh oh-oh)
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time

Fuck ya!

Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream
Well it still is, and I never wanna wake
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face

That was then, this is now
Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now
We never questioned it, was more like when and how

That was then, this is now
Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Ya!

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from

This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Let me find the way that I can make do
Without circumstance, without follow through
A man in desperation can't trust a troubled mind
I'm building an empire, say I'm wrong
I don't mind if it's all against one
No room for weakness, I'll be gone forever

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck
I'm reflecting on these past few years I spent trying to forget
I'm regretting all this time spent half the world away
What will the children sing, what will the children sing
When I'm dead and buried?
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried

I can't fight it
I can't fight it
I can't fight it
I've slipped through the cracks

I hold nothing back

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck
I'm reflecting on these past few years I spent trying to forget
I'm regretting all this time spent half the world away

Dead and buried
Dead and buried

Never thought it'd be easy, 'cause it's not if it's worth to have
It'll pass you by, you have a choice, be your own person, have your own voice

So let's set it off!

Of what brought us here today
Oh, you'll be the end of me
I'm never happy like we were happy
I'm never sad like we were sad
Oh, you'll be the end of me

You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause oh, you'll be the end of me

I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying
Till I forgot why I stayed
Oh, you'll be the end of me
Yeah, we lost all meanin', we lost the magic
So good luck to you on your way
Oh, you'll be the end of me

Hello, you don't seem like yourself
At least from what I knew, you're somebody else
Oh no, it's so much harder to take
It took me four years to realize you're a fake
But I won't lie, I'd forfeit all the rest of my time to patch things up
Just to take back what you stole of mine

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

You know, I grew so tired of the games you consistently played, where I took all the blame
It's true, you're just unhappy with you
You drink every night, so you can't think things through
And I, I tried, to give you peace of mind
One day you'll wake up, and realize what's passed you by

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

Good things don't end, they end badly
You got a lot of nerve, and I'm not catching up
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

You say it's over? I say, what's the rush?
No matter what, it's never enough
You don't care, I knew you never cared

You say it's over? I say, what's the rush?
No matter what, it's never enough
I don't care, you know that I ain't scared.

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

I'd never wish any of this on anyone or anything.
Aw come on, you gotta try and look at things like me.
I never needed anything I got,
I never keep anything I have, what do I have?
Mostly things that'll never last.

Then I think back...

I remember when I first saw the country.
I remember sleeping in the van.
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand.
I remember jumping off of cliff tops.
I remember playing with no one there.
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been.
Cause where I've been.

They wonder why I hide myself from everyone,
from everything, man come on.
You wouldn't last a day as me.
Everyone loves me for my past, but they always hate me in the present.
Why can't you just meet me somewhere in the middle?

It's in the hardest times we grow the most.

I remember when I first saw the country.
I remember sleeping in the van.
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand.
I remember jumping off of cliff tops.
I remember playing with no one there.
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been.
Cause where I've been.

Speeding up, to slow down.
Side glances around this crowd all at me.
There must be something I can't see, so tell me.
Hold me up, help me out.
As I circle around what makes me happy.
There isn't one place that I can be without leaving.
This is my life.

I remember when I first saw the country.

They don't understand.

I remember jumping off of cliff tops.

Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am.
I remember the coast of California.
I remember trucks stops cross the land.
Never kept too many idols cause we were busy being them.
I remember waking up in Georgia. I remember quitting my last job.
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I was, where I've been.
Cause where I've been.

And I've got a weakness for them.
No this ain't the time or place to show your face,
Cause you know that I can't stand
The need to get even. Tonight,
When everything ya say won't come out right.
So I'll try to save some face, and take my space
Till the times right, cause we'll need it.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember? The truth,
Cause they won't even want me to.

Wish you would read this, oh yeah,
And knew that I mean it. I did.
Yeah I could fill every page with all my ways
That I tried to understand.
Wished things could be different. Alright,
Well it ain't for the lack of how I tried.
So let's go our separate ways, and count the days
As we get by. Cause we'll get by.

As I look 'round this makeshift moving house
I'm searching for whatever's left of me
It's on the ground in a box that reads lost and found
It's lost and found

She said, just let it go
She said, it's all you've ever known

And I'm, I'm already gone
I'm already something to someone
That I don't know
When will I know?

And I'm, I'm out making rounds
On every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

I've worked it out, you'll always bring me down
From here on out, I'm doing things for me
I'm impatient now, I'm not the type for life alone
I need someone

She said, just let it go
And she said, it's all you've ever known

With everything that sets me back
I push back harder to clear the way
There's not a thing that I regret
Can't live my life in yesterday

With everything that sets me back

Guess things didn't go the way that you planned
I missed the days when you would understand
The way that I am
You have me feeling lonely and detached
Every time I'm moving forward
We take two steps back
I need to have a moment to myself
County lines, clear my mind with someplace else
Besides this stairwell
Alone and on the road, I'm overwhelmed
I need to find the difference in how I feel and how I felt

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone
Leave all the lights on

I wish I could get back to the way things were
When we were young, having fun, so self assured
But now that's all a blur
I miss the way we always used to talk
Now we talk ourselves in circle till we forget why we fought

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone
Leave all the lights on
If I'm not worth letting go
Leave all the lights on
If you still care I need to know
Leave all the lights on

This gets me so down down down
Why can't we work it out, can't we work it out?
This makes me so down down down
I've been trying to see, if you were meant for me
You get me so down down down, I'm gonna turn this car around
Just know that it's the last time
Ya it's the last time.

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone (Down, down, down)
Leave all the lights on,
If I'm not worth letting go
Leave all the lights on, if you still cared I need to know (Down, down, down)
Leave all the lights on

Guess things didn't go the way that you planned

When the curtain falls it rolls, unwraps, reminds me
The person that I am
I'm still afraid, ashamed, of what's behind me
But you gave me the strength to stand

Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)
Just sh-sh-shake it off, and no one will ever know (won't know)

I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave

Sometimes when no one's left to listen I'll sit and argue with myself
Say all the things I wish to tell you, without hurting someone else
Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)
Just sh-sh-shake it off, and no one will ever know (won't know)

I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid they'll walk with me until my end

Hey you, when'd ya get so cold? (When'd ya get so cold?)
Hey you, just do what you're told, do what you're told
Hey you, you're gonna be a star
As long as you'll let us we'll make you the person that you aren't

Life lessons learned the hard way.

Four people waited in a random white unmarked van.
Parked outside your hotel high rise garage.
To use a tire iron to break the bones inside your legs.
Too bad you never came outside, that's all right,
'Cause in the end you'll get wrecked.
Yeah, in the end, you'll get wrecked.

I heard a little girl killed herself today, that blood's on your hands.
It's on your hands, when everyone knows your face, nothing's safe.
You'll live your life as a fucking target.

You've earned my disgust.

We're coming out swinging!

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn't do
Don't want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes and every local bar
Played a show a night till it'd make me sick

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey! (Hey)!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"

We left home with no kinda back up plan
And everyone we knew that we couldn't stand
Said if you can't make it here, you won't make it there
Don't want to hear about it
Spent most of our time sleeping on hard wood floors
People's living rooms in any open door
We played a show a night till it all made sense

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey! (Hey)!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it yet

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey!
I'm right back at it again

I've lost a part of me
Cause I am just an open book for everyone to see
I always leave empty handed
I can't keep the things that mean the most to me
I'm walking steady on a tightrope
Clinging only to the words that I wrote
I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face?
I've always wanted to know
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it, I don't get it
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough
And that's alright with me
You take me for granted
I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
And those that are weak at the seams
You weren't worth my time
You weren't worth my time
But still I let you take it from me

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face?
I've always wanted to know
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it, I don't get it
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

Why do I always do this to myself?
Always depending on everyone else
You know it's gonna drive me crazy
You're just a notch in the wall that made me
Why do I always do this to myself?

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
Go get carried away

Go!

And the fears sets in, in an instant
Too much of myself gets exposed
This is where I go at my weakest
When I don't have to be scared to tell the truth

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong
That's why sad songs make me happy, 'cause I don't have to feel alone

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

It's never what you've done, it's what you've done lately
Who cares what you're saying, if no one's listening
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt
To those left in sadness I'll be the one to lead you out

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me

You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don't make me who I am

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don't make me who I am

God help those who help themselves, and forget about everyone else
You lost your nerve, you missed the point
God help those with open hands, may they never feel burden again
Yeah I'll stand up for those who can't
I'll close the distance

You're all about you, and it's my fast track to an early grave.
Just need to see this through
Do you even sleep at night?
Where does your conscience run to hide?

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can't you just do what's right by me?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It can't get much harder, harder to breathe.

The room keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep.
Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me.
Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight.

How's living a lie?
You never could face me,
And you hide behind fake personalities
Because deep down you're scared.
So weak beyond compare.

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can't we just go our separate ways?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It won't be much farther, I'm counting the days.

We stuck together through all we lost.
Even when your worst surrounds me, you'll never get the best of us.

I've been feeling like everything is for nothing
In fact I've never felt so goddamn small
Always searching for the bright side to find the strength for when I fall
I'm still believing that life has a meaning
Cant cope with thinking that there's not
I'm so divided that I try to hide it
It's the only real thing that I've got!

So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
Somethings gotta give

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You can call this a warning
It's a warning that were drowning in our malcontent
Tear me down like a cancer, whats your answer?
We're different and it makes you sick
There is a sadness here, on every corner
It's in our hearts dear God
Don't wanna trouble you much
But we all need to know when enough is enough

cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You only get one chance and that's one too much
What's the world gonna say when I call your bluff, punk?

Bow your head

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones

Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

I walk along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I couldn't get away

Dead as dead can be
The doctor tells me
But I just can't believe him
Ever the optimistic one
I'm sure of your ability to become
My perfect enemy

Wake up
And face me
Don't play dead
'Cause maybe
Someday
I'll walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

Leaning over you here
Cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection
What you could and might have been
It's your right and your ability
To become my perfect enemy

Wake up (why can't you)
And face me (come on now)
Don't play dead (don't play dead)
'Cause maybe (because maybe)
Someday (someday)

Overcome by your moving temple
Overcome by this holiest of altars
So pure, so rare,
To witness such an unearthly goddess
That I've lost my self-control
Beyond compelled to throw this dollar
Down before your
Holiest of altars

I'd sell my soul, my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss,
One taste of you, my Magdalena

I bear witness to this place,
This prayer, so long forgotten
So pure, so rare
To witness such an unearthly goddess

That I'd sell my soul, my self-esteem

For one chance, one kiss,

Pull me into your perfect circle

One womb

Liberate this will
To release us all

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this
Umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you

And from pulling you down with me in here
I can almost hear you scream

One more medicated peaceful moment
Give me
One more medicated peaceful moment

And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility
I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this

Run, desire, run
Sexual being
Running like a blade
To and through the heart, no conscience
One Motive: cater to the hollow

Screaming
"Feed me here, fill me up again"
Temporarily pacify this hunger
That's so cruel

Libido
Throw dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles,
In circles
Constantly consuming,
Conquer and devour

Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming
"Feed me here, fill me up again"
Temporarily pacifying

Feed me here, fill me up again
Temporarily pacifying

Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

Over you

Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China
White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Little angel, go away
Come again some other day
The Devil has my ear today
I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace
And some peace of mind
Whatever, just as long as I don't feel so

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Hier an diesem Ort

Also gruben wir ein Loch in den Sand
Wie es in den Katalogen stand
Und wie wir von deinen Eltern
Oder deinen Verwandten
Oder deren Eltern kannten

Glas an Glas erklingt
Die goldene Katze winkt
Und ich hör jetzt schon wie
Dein Vater halleluja singt

Wir baun uns etwas auf
Und es lohnt sich alle mal
Wir tanzen durch den Staub
Und singen sha-la-la-la-la

Mit dem Fotoapparat
Und leckern Schnittchen in der Hand
Führen wir dich herum
Wenn du magst

Und hier ist längst nicht alles fertig
Und du hast recht, das Bild da hängt noch schief
Aber übermorgen fahrn die zu Ikea
Und dann sieht das gleich ganz anders aus
Doch jetzt stoß erst mal mit uns an und auf
Aus dem alten Trott sind wir jetzt endlich raus

Und ich hör jetzt schon wie

Und warteten auf Licht

Sie zeigte mir die Stadt
Und unter einer der Laternen nahm sie meine Hand

Und hinter dem Hochhaus
Malten Menschen
Mit Raketen ein Feuerwerk
Diese Farben
Stechen manchmal
Wie Macheten bis ins Herz

Früher in der Nacht
Traf Sturm auf Gänsehaut
Wir zählten unser Geld
Und warfen es am Tresen raus

Die Frage nach der Menschlichkeit hat sie bejaht
Kurz bevor uns dieses Schwein aus seinem Laden warf

Guck sie doch an die Arschlöcher:
Alles schön grau in grau, bisschen braun dazwischen.
Pfui, ich muss kotzen, wenn ich dran denk'.

In Deutschlands Strassen und Passagen,
in Deutschlands Zellen und Bordellen,
nirgendwo redet man mehr davon.
Über uns verliert man kein Ton.

Denn über uns spricht man nicht gern.
Vor uns hält man sich lieber fern.
Manche Leute wünschen uns den Tod,
doch in der Nacht brennt der Himmel feuerrot.

Wir leben, wir leben, wir leben immer noch!
Wir leben, wir leben, wir leben immer noch!

Dann kommen wir aus unser'm Loch

Denn totgeweihte leben lang,

You never gave me your strength
But I've always been stronger
You never gave me your love
But I've given you mine

You were just an illusion
My tormenting confusion
Was I ever good enough for you?

You were the butterfly in the glass jar
That I could never let go
Sewed and wrapped your wings off
So you couldn't fly away
Fly away from me

(just let me go)
(please, just let me go)

You never gave me your strength
Your love, your anything
Was I just an illusion,
Some tormenting confusion?
Was I ever good enough for you?

You were the butterfly in the glass jar
That I could never let go
Sewed and wrapped your wings off
So you couldn't fly away
Fly away from me

You were the person I could imagine
Spending the rest of my life with
In your arms, in your arms

I could never let you fly away
Please don't leave me, I said
(don't you) Don't you go
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna die within you
You were my butterfly

Album  Attitudes of a Difficult Mind
People never see the other side of darkness.
There's no fear,
The faces of those you've hurt, they cannot even be seen,
But you'll never forget the one (who you meet) in the dark.

Within this place I've sensed no evil,
Only the absence of hurt that I had felt.
Death holds my heart and keeps me imprisoned
To shield me from another fall.

Without caution I moved towards nothing
And you have seen me somehow.
The imperfection in your mirrored reflection of a beauty
That died inside of me.

Darkness comforts me in this moment,
I'm slipping into comas of complication,
I want to embrace you, hold you.
The mind is plagued with the morbid hesitation.
Just tell me you're suffering
And I will give you everything
Though I have nothing,
But the darkness in my eyes.
The darkness in your eyes...

You found me in this, I found you a rose... of death.
Do I want you, could you want me?
Accept my bouquet of decay.
Am I an image that comforts your fantasy
Or will this surface turn my dark reality?
Are you the one, am I the one?
The wraiths have left me.
And sun will kill us, suddenly kill us.

Darkness comforts me in this moment,
I'm slipping into comas of complication,
I want to embrace you, hold you.
The mind is plagued with the morbid hesitation.
Just tell me you're suffering
And I will give you everything
Though I have nothing,
But the darkness in my eyes.
The darkness in your eyes...

Follow the roses down into the depths
And you'll see what has brought you here.
The wounds of the heart, the depletion of faith,
And the darkness inside your eyes,
Darkness inside my eyes,
Darkness inside your eyes.
Inside my eyes...

Flies invade your spoiled words,
Spoken once to comfort me.
But in your game I was deceived,
And now this question I ask of you:

Can you see me behind the lids which drape your eyes,
Waiting for that moment when all you've worked for dies?
In that place you call a heart, can my answer dwell?
Just utter the words to release me, deceiver,
From this doubt infested cell

A contraption of seduction, you encouraged my fall
From the place that resisted you
And when I failed to ignore my heart
You exposed a wound and bled me through

(The rage inside is building now
To conquer the bringer of my fading world
Nothing can protect that slayer of love
For pain can ignite an apocalypse)

Even angels have to die
With their ascension buried deeper
Our world, in time, shall become a grave
Inside there will be dirt instead of feelings

All our hearts must learn to break
For nothing beautiful lasts forever
The longing of what's lost shall never fade
A void is left and we feel so empty

Even angels have to die
No love on earth can restrain its ending
Sadness waits to claim our fall
And mourn for love that seeks its savior

Darkness finds me in my fate
The beautiful face which may bring salvation
Souls embrace a shattering wound
Have I strength to admit my desperation?

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die

Even angels have to die
But love is worth the tears that it brings me
I'll bleed with you 'til I am drained
Though my color may be less than perfect

Could the intent be to invade
This place where nothing dreams eternal?
Fear that you'll be torn away
Had lead me to my own decay

This thought of wasting haunts my mind
For my heart can't lose another angel

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die

Save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die

Wanna see your flesh rip, tear as you fall

Inside your hell bound heart that tore me apart
Now here with me you will stay
And with your mind games I will play
Where your suffering tastes so sweet
Here you're nothing but the victim at my feet

I want to keep you away from the peace
The one that you deprived me before I had deceased
And what reason could you give for my death?
You're an angel killer, don't waste your breath

It was your hell bound heart that tore me apart
Now here with me you will stay
And with your mind games I will play
When your suffering tastes so sweet
You'll be nothing but the victim at my feet

An attraction to such discomfort arises from within.
And when all words are spoken this tension is released.
This beauty's metamorphosis into a beast.

Give in to your skin, (lust for your body)
Give in to your sin.

Give in to your heart, (lust for your body)

Can you deny what festers so passionately inside?
Slaughter the necromancer that resurrects your bride.
Can these intentions penetrate a lover's lie?
Taste the lips of the moment and allow the soul to die.

How could I have been so foolish?
How could I have been so blind?
What will it take for me to find
The place where you are inside of my mind?
Within and safe,
Protected by tears.
Hiding, a cowards behind all of your fears.

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this great misery,
And nothing seems to make any sense to me.

Will this be a memory, will I have ever existed?
The words you spoke, could I have resisted?
Keep all of your heart and then depart
Before the wings of an angel had been torn apart.

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this great misery,
And nothing seems to make any sense to me.

I am more that what I have become,
But am naive to have believed that you were the one
To save me from this desperate state.
How my love has turned so deeply into hate?

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this great misery,
Does any of this make sense to me?

Album  Breaking The Broken
Seeking winter I have found,
Something colder in my heart.
Hope depleting as I pass,
That which falls to pretend.
Never effort to offend,
But to restrain these dreams I'm having.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.

Palest rain that touched my face
As I ran towards a cruel illusion.
Hold this fragile thought in vain,
Tough that future will not save us.
Sleeping hell that wakes for me.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.

All the damage that you've done to me.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.

All the damage that you've done to me.

Time had consumed me
Open liquid falls from my eye
To hope that I seek comfort
For my insignificant demise

To cloud all reason
And accept this pain
With my hands raised towards nothing
Screaming for your uncertain lingering

Aged and strayed
And I've lost my heart's desire

Now I've made not we
This sacrifice you were
Too careless
To ever see

To this destination
So far from my mind
Omens have brought me so deep
And decayed

Aged and strayed
And I've lost my heart's desire

Now I bleed not we
My sacrifice you were
Too careless
To ever see

Aged and strayed
And I've lost my heart's desire

And now I bleed not we

Too hopeless
To ever see

In sleep I find
No sympathy
And I've become
So numb

In the hour of passing
To this emptiness

Why do you hide your eyes from me?
There is no shame in empathy

I'm not perfect, there's no explanation.
I've not come for complication.

Stakes are made so that we learn,
Not stains that lead our souls to burn.

Why do you feel this way?

Have I failed you,
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide,
I see and love you as you are.

Why do you run from sadness?
It comes from someplace good.
If you've never truly loved,
Then you've never truly hurt.
Does that make make you feel weak?
And have I crossed that line?

Have I failed you,
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide,
I see and love you as you are.

Do not hide your face from me,
Tears are a sign of God's mercy.
As you cry, so does he.
I love you as you are...

Are higher than the ones you've known.
And it's much darker on this side,
See why my heart I had to hide.

It's in this place
I may be some prince, some king, some freak.
But it means nothing without your hand
Here in mine.

But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you.
But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you.

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go,
Inside my mind it's still not free.

Here I'm stronger.
No emotions to bring me down.
But what is it a heart
If we don't tear it apart
In a masquerade of game we play?

The lights above us,
These towers we could never climb.
You once were a star to lead me away
From the pain within my own decay.

But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you.

Your broken saint, your ancient story
The living challenge to their lies

Trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
And they want to force my hand

Until I take what I want
And break all the lies
That they feed the fucking liars

Smash all the temples
And crawl through the rubble
And cry to the fallen

I'm the last of my kind, still standing
I'm alone

A wolf alone upon the hillside
I live on what they throw away
I go to sleep behind the 8 ball
I live to fight for one more day

There ain't no shelter
And they want to force my hand

Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb… (in bloom)

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
Oh, you don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now I'm a man who won't let himself be

Down in a hole,
Feeling so small
Down in a hole,
Losing my soul

I'd like to fly,
But my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Down in a hole,

I walk this maze alone

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free?

Man's beside himself
Man's below himself
Man's behind himself
Am I inside myself?

Chaos and hate shadow me
Pain, it fills me up
Only one thing makes me feel
Missing better half of me

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free?

Man's beside himself
Man's below himself
Man's behind himself
Am I inside myself?

Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

All of your colors turn to grey
Don't even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Can't really say how you lost your mind

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold...

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can't tell my up from down

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can't tell my uṗ from down

All of the faces
Life can show
Withered and ugly,
The one you know

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can't tell my up from down

I've gone cold
Hard to deal
Used to stand
Where I kneel

Everybody, listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

I want more
Than I need
I don't know
What is real

Everybody, listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

Anytime I listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

Whispering of names,
Faces,
Uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone

Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems

I've been told
Dreaming is free
Think I'll go
Back to sleep

Everybody, listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

Anytime I listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:

Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love, it's very late
'Til morning comes
Let's tessellate

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One bird, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins

Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up
Yes, they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love, it's very late
'Til morning comes
Let's tessellate

I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole!)
I wanna be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you

I'm gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woolen jumper
Be your minpin and borrower of handsome trivia

Devour me
Lou, Lou, let the cover girls sing!

All handclaps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room)
I wanna be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw dusted patios
I'm gonna kiss you, like the sun browns you

Devour me
Devour me
If you really think that you can stomach me

Heimdall gazes east
A sail has caught his eye
He lifts his hand and sounds the horn
The undead army has arrived

Here comes Nagelfar
With Laufey's son on board
He brings chaos, hate and wrath
He brings the war to end all wars

Heimdall knows his fate
The end of all nine worlds
It's what the Vala has foreseen
He knows that everything shall burn

Facing Lopt's deceit
Now they finally meet
The champion and his enemy
On Vigrid's plains they'll find defeat

Their swords meet in a mighty clash
War cries sound, horns they blast
Their eager weapons whip and thrash
This day when all shall end

The lords of war are equal strong
This battle frantic and forlorn
The blades sing a macabre song
This day when all shall end

Heimdall's blade bites burning sharp
As it cuts through flesh and bone
Blood comes gushing from the wound
As Loke's head falls tumbling
Rolling to the burning ground

Look to my burning eyes
Plead for your worthless life
All remorse I had has died
And all I have is hate inside

You took my soul from me
You took my family
You killed them all ferociously
Now this is what I give to thee

Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs are cracked
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Terror grips your dying heart
Blood eagle!

Helpless on the ground
Hands and feet tightly bound
In my eyes no mercy found
My sharp knife starts to carve around

Penetrate your naked skin
Rip flesh and dig within
With a pleased and twisted grin
I spread your lungs like eagle's wings

The burning grief is tormenting me
The hate I feel is destroying me
Only vengeance will give me peace
Only vengeance will set my spirit free

Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs will crack
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes will stare
Slow death grips your tortured heart
Blood eagle!

Racing 'cross the arctic lands
A mounted legion
Under my command
We're a brutal force
No men can withstand
Total havoc is at hand

See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside

The fateful message
Reached us months ago
That our home was under siege
And since that day
We've been heading north
Our kinsmen needed our relief

As we near our fortress walls
Black smoke is rising to the sky
Burnt black ruins
Of our father's halls
And corpses greet our tired eyes

What madness led them to attack
Victory could not be won
They must've known
There was no turning back
And now they all are gone
No woman, child or man was spared
Their bodies lying where they fell
Suffering, anguish and despair
As they went through living hell

So now we're on the ride again
And vengeance is
Our newfound path
We draw our strength
From grief and pain
These bastards shall know
Our endless wrath

See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside

Since I was born, they have kept me down,
They have forced me to conform.
I will tear down the holy crown in a vengeful thunderstorm,
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise,
Fueling flames of violent rage,
I will be their world's demise.

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods

All this rage, and all this hate,
It burns me deep inside,
And still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive.
Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me.

Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!

Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver of the gods

Asgard's always been my home
I'm of a different blood
I've come to overthrow their throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods!

So he found the heart in barren land
It was beating, still alive
He held it gently in his hand
And looked up to the sky

With evil thoughts of vicious kind
And sinister disdain
His thoughts of bringing back to life
The witch that died in flames

Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

He then devoured Gullveig's heart
And she was born again
They brought to life an evil force
A beast that can't be tamed

With dark deception in his soul
Betrayal of the gods
The bane of Oden now is born
Born of evil blood

Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

They brought to life a malicious force
A vile beast that cannot be tamed
Fimbultyr's nemesis now is born
A vile beast that can't be restrained

Welcome to my humble home
Your soul is mine to keep
There are no walls of rock and stone
Yet no one ever leaves

Those who die of age and plague
Are welcomed in my court
Murderers, miscreants
Will linger here and rot

Those who die inglorious
And those who die in shame
They are all sent to my dark halls
They all shall fear my name

Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel

I welcome you to Hel

Now here you are in my cold realm
You are my honored guest
At the banquette of the dead
Your soul will never rest

Your soul is mine to keep (Your soul is mine to keep)
And you will never leave (And you will never leave)

I was born of giant's blood
Raised in Asgård, the home of gods
I am the master of disguise
For this trait I've gained your prize

Fast in thought, quicker tongue
Brawl with me and you'll get stung
I am the master of deceit
My words bind or set you free

I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter

You call me evil; curse my name
But you only have yourselves to blame
Order need its anarchy
Balance through calamity

We mixed our blood in olden days
Now I wander like a stray
We were brothers, now estranged
I will have my sweet revenge

My words are poison to your ears
I say the words you fear
Still you know it is the truth you hear
Ragnarök is drawing near

There you sit in Aegir's hall
Waiting for the coming fall
Council of the now condemned
Twilight of both gods and men

Face the facts; you're old and weak
Empty words are all you speak
No escape, there's no return
The universe shall bleed and burn

I am the eagle in the sky
The shape shifter
Vicious wolf
Howling in the night
The shape shifter
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
I am the eagle in the sky
The vicious wolf
Howling in the night
I am the walker on the wind
Lying words,
With an honest grin

Outside these walls
An army awaits
But in these halls
We feel safe

Countless attacks
We have repelled
They won't turn back
They cannot be quelled

Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements will not show
The day is much too late

Broken and weak
Never give in
Prospects are bleak
We can't win

There is no hope
No time for lament
End of the rope
Our lives are spent

We have held out for months
Hoping for relief
Our fortress now our tomb
And salvation now our grief
We have held out for months
Waiting for relief
Our fortune's now our own
This is destiny

Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements never showed
As the daylight starts to fade
There's nothing left to lose
We have run out of time
There is nothing left to choose
Expect how we shall die

Open the gates!
Now we attack!
Ride into fate!
No turning back!

Stand by the King!
To glory we ride!
Weapons and shield!
Together we die!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
All the world shall know our bravery!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
One last charge for death or victory!

We were the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We'd never lost a fight in war
We feared not the grave

The ruler of this northern court
My brother, lord, king
He always had our loyal swords
But we would feel his sting

The ageing king had no decendants
No heir to take his throne
It filled his soul with fear
Transcendent
That next in line was my first-born

The king's heart grew
Full of dark deception
Full of foul conspiracy
This was when dark days
Had their inception
And we fell to his vile deceit

Robbed of arms, robbed of pride
But he spared our lives
The fear he had of Oden's wrath
Held his vengeful knife

With hearts so cold we left our homes
Banished from our land
A life in shame, a life in grief
Until we rise again

Winters come, winters pass
Twenty wasted years
We're ageing men, our youth is gone
We will shed no tears

Winters come and winters pass
Tenty years have gone
Like a dream we fade away
Into oblivion

We are the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We're old but strong as before
And we don't fear the grave

From the south an army rises
They ride under cross of gold
From the shades we're called
In a time of crisis
To defend the king now weak and old

As the flames of warfare rage higher
We feel our destiny's embrace
We are ageing men of an old empire
Now we can see Valhalla's gates

We!
March again
First in line
To reach Valhalla's mighty gates

We!
March again
March to fight
To reach Valhalla's mighty
We!
March again
Give our lives
To reach Valhalla's
Mighty royal gates

On this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall

Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in savage game
Our spirits, spears
And shields are linked
In a much stronger chain

March as one
Don't look back

Attack!

All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls
All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Charge with force! Break their ranks!
No remorse, crush their flanks!
Pulverize their human wall!

Als wir noch real waren, hingen wir nur rum in einem Keller
Und nahmen nur Tracks auf, wir war'n Untergrund-Rapper
Die Lieder war'n cool, doch das Mikro war kaputt
Manchmal hatten wir ein' Auftritt und niemand hörte zu
Heute ist das anders, wir ham jetzt Erfolg
Uns're traurigen Augen ham den Glanz schon verlor'n
Ein Mann über Bord, trotzdem machten wir weiter
Verkauften die Seele aus Raffgierigkeit
Die Musik wurde schlechter, die Brieftasche fetter
Die Texte zu ernst, Ironie ist zu Ende
Anstatt weiter Klamauk zu machen
Hielten wir es für klug, jetzt was auszusagen
Platte Phrasen, reines Kalkül
Was man so macht, wenn man ein Reihenhaus will
Das fake Anti-Image, dass uns die Kids glauben
Und gesungene Hooks, weil wir Hits brauchen


Das ist die neue Antilopen Gang
Die Unschuld ist verlor'n, wir tun jetzt, was wir woll'n
Es geht nur noch um Erfolg
Die neue Antilopen Gang
Aus der Vergangenheit gelernt, wir machen ab jetzt ernst
So vermarkten wir uns selbst
Das ist die neue Antilopen Gang
Die Seele ist verkauft, das Leben ist versaut
Doch wir geben niemals auf
Das ist die neue Antilopen Gang (Ey!)
Die neue Antilopen Gang (Ey!)


Ich weiß noch genau, wie das alles begann
Per Wochenendticket mit der Bahn durch das Land
Auf die Bühnen der Jugendzentren und Dorfdiskos
Vorhang auf für ein kleines bisschen Horrorshow
Und waren wir mal broke bei 'ner Session
Haben wir im Supermarkt halt geklaut, um zu essen
Und jetzt kau' ich den Seeteufel, reit' mit dem Bauch
Wir haben uns're Seele an den Teufel verkauft
Yeah - Jetzt sind wir sexy, weil wir reich sind
Nächstes Jahr machen wir denselben Dreck wie Deichkind
Und keiner fühlt die Parts, doch sie spülen das Konto voller Geld, das ist besser, als es früher war
Und wir waten durch moralischen Morast
Das Drama um Jakob hat unser'n Namen groß gemacht
Aber hey mir geht es gut, wirklich oberaffengeil
Ich hab' es doch gesagt, Antilopen macht reich




Damals war'n wir jung und wir brauchten das Geld
Heute sind wir dumm und versaufen das Geld
Wir tauschten uns're Seele lieber ein gegen was Schönes
Da sie im März 2013 aufhörte zu leben
Mussten tausend Tode sterben und aus den Tragödien lernen
Dass das Einzige was zählt ist ein Vermögen anzuhäufen
Vermarkten nun den Widerstand gegen Vermarktungsstrategien
Kapitalisier'n Anti-Kapitalismus-Attitüden
Ich hab' nix zu sagen, dafür steh' ich mit mei'm Namen
Wenn du mich bekehren willst, redest du dich um Kopf und Kragen
Früher war'n wir DIY, Free-Download, Soli-Gig
Heute leg' ich auf dem Spiegel Lines südamerik Kokain
Jeder, der mein Album runterlädt, schuldet mir Geld
Mein Anwalt schickt dir Abmahnungen rund um die Welt
Es gibt nur ein Problem, du kriegst diese Gang aus dem Aschenbecher
Doch den Aschenbecher nicht aus der Gang




Wir geben keinen Fick und wir nehmen alles mit
Es geht eh nicht mehr zurück und wir sehen es als Witz

So now that you know it's right
Can you see it from the otherside
Do you see there is no wrong or right
Can you leave them in another tide
There will be no other promise
I can now give to show the other slight
So the ground will make your love light
Hold the sleepers to the morning light

But as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all

So do you lead them to the light
Tie the noose or settle sides
Can you bring them to another life
Can you breathe into a lovers lie
So while we sink into a second sign
Fold the leaves into a dotted line
You will see the limbs of love and pride
Follow suit without a single sigh

So as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all
It made no sense at all
It made no sense at all

One by one we told ourselves
That they would keep the promises that we made
We made your sons and daughters
They will be nothing like us

I'll never tell you again
So pay your lips to be the seconds I count in over
And breathe life into cold, cold hearts
We will not tell you again,
We will not falter again

So as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound

Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low

Sunk this low

(Rotten to the core)
So who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
Now we're gone, left without a trace
But we took something they cannot replace

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror

You knew all along that the cancer would spread
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Sorry son but we destroyed your home
We murdered your family, now you're on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall, it's all just part of the plan

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
And every execution
The price of your collusion

Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low

Sunk this low

You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core

The workers all march to the beat of the drum
Their spirits are broken, they have nowhere to run
They dream of courage and a loaded gun
But the slaves all know they better bite their tongue

Track marks across the planet
Are there any veins left for them to infect?
They would kill one another just to disconnect

Three cheers for desperation
God bless the godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin

The workers all march to the beat of the drum
They fell into the trap, taken one by one
The medicine is poison but it makes them numb
'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret
Existence is just something they would rather forget

Three cheers for desperation
God bless the godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin

Is this freedom, is this the life you chose?
If this is living the dream, we've hit an all time low

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin

There was a time for change, I fear it came and went
Who's gonna pick up the pieces, who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's no turning back

Now there's no turning back

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn
We just wanna watch the world burn

Our collapse will be remission
A planet scarred beyond all recognition
Suicide in slow motion, is this the path we have chosen?
Too cowardly to face this; we've got a fucking death wish

You want to play with fire? Don't cry when you get burnt
You gave us life, we gave back death in return
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's not turning back

We will consume until there's nothing left
Remember us as a waste of breath

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn
We just wanna watch the world burn

I know you know that we've been living a lie
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
We just wanna watch the world burn

I want to believe that it all counts for something
The writing is on the wall
It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing
All for nothing

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn
We just wanna watch the world burn

They want all for one and none for all
I want to be there to witness the downfall

They'll only sell us out when our backs are turned
And we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Every snake has its price
If the money's on the table they don't think twice
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin

We are paralysed
But there are none so blind as those who will not see
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck
About what matters to us

Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette
They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Always out for blood, praying on the weak
We can count on them to paint the future bleak
But still we're standing by whilst they bleed us dry

We are paralysed

There is no end game
So whisper the truth and pass on the blame
Just put us out of our misery, this defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

A failed evolution
Is the problem the solution
That they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone

A thorn in the side of the earth
Where do you draw the line? A flaw in the design
The rest is history, this defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger

We may be infinite but this world is not
Something that we once knew that we long forgot
That we long forgot

We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again

The weight of the world is resting on thin ice
When the surface breaks will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect
What a waste of time I was in retrospect

I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

Annihilate me

Do you remember when you said to me
"My friend, hope is a prison"?
Hope is a prison

Of all the patterns that I could create
I built a labyrinth with no escape
To keep myself under lock and key
I am my own worst enemy

I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
(God knows I lost all my faith)

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep

Accept that what is meant to be (Is meant to be)
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

This is a wake up call, no rise without the fall
Facing the great divide, you can run but you can't hide

You can run but you can't hide

I met the devil and God and couldn't tell them apart
I thought I found the end but it was only the start

I've heard it all before
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
(Just let go) Gravity, hold on to me

So come and wash us away
Just thank fuck that we don't last forever (It's now or never)
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere
Because it's gone and it's never coming back

But make no mistake
It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks
So stand your ground, the earth will shake
So twist the knife 'cause I am finally awake

So come and wash us away

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, let me live and die in peace

(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)

I will be consumed, returned into the earth
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow
Cut the chord and cast me out, and cast me out

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease

"Change
And everything is change; nothing can be held on to
To the degree that you go with a stream
You see, you are are still; you are flowing with it
But to the degree you resist the stream
Then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you
So swim with it, go with it, and you're there; you're at rest"

It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own
It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own

When my heart skips two beats
I am hidden deep, fast asleep
The sea will part where oceans meet
Finally complete

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay's the only law

Swan song, a declaration of endlessness
I swear I will not look back as I return into the black
When the veil lifts, how will I know, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace

And once upon a time we had the world at our feet
Well, we're all dying to meet our maker
But all our gods have abandoned us

All our gods have abandoned us
This is the great esoteric depression
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation

We are all the shades of misery
The reigning champions of tragedy
They use their faith as a weapon, they count our sins by the seven
Blackwater at the gates of heaven

All hail the corporatocracy
The word of God written in binary
All hail our apostasy
The dying notes in an unholy symphony

All our gods have abandoned us
This is the great esoteric depression
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation

I found God clutching a razorblade
He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold"

No one is safe, no one is welcome here

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white
I'll chase the dying of the light

They want the victims to hang their heads in shame
Well fuck them all, we won't play their game
We won't play their game
I've seen through every word the prophets propagate

This is a failed state
So read between the lines
This is a failed state

No love, no empathy
Our fellow man is now our enemy
No love, no unity
Erase our souls, distort reality

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white
I'll chase the dying of the light

They will sow the seeds of blind contempt
Then let us bleed until our heart's content

Every moment is dead to me

Do you remember? Because I can't forget
The saddest story of all that ever was
Or will be, laid out before me
A living heart attack, play it back, play it back

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense
Past and future tense, every moment is dead to me
Safe and sound, anywhere but here
I see it crystal clear but it means nothing to me

It means nothing to me
It means nothing to me

Have you seen a future filled with regret?
Breathe and count to ten, start over again
You want to run away, just let yourself decay
A living heart attack, play it back, play it back

The empty hourglass, we're going nowhere fast
There's no more time to kill if time is standing still

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense
Past and future tense, every moment is dead to me

The Son of God, hangman's pawn
Control our lives with fairy-tales and shallow lies

You say we'll burn in Hell...;
Spiteful preacher, I know you well!

Desperation breathes and follows you home
Just look around– you're not alone...;
One life, one chance; the world in front of me

Intelligent design, sending shivers up my spine
Cells mutate and divide
What a sadistic intention

No light! No dark!
No ups! No downs!
I'll find peace, buried in the ground

The lights go out
The fuse has blown
No Heaven or Hell to bring– me– home

You say we'll burn in Hell...;
Spiteful preacher, I know you well!

Desperation breathes and follows you home
Just look around– you're not alone
One life, one chance; the world in front of me

Another division to tear us apart
Try to fill the hole inside your heart
Another division to tear us apart
Try to fill the hole inside your heart

Sun of god, Sun in the sky–
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say:
"There's more to me than meets the eye...;"

Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
The wind was taking us in the wrong direction
It's about time we showed some disaffection

Carry the weight of thousands of years
Turn the page, let's make it all disappear
We've had enough of inhibited progression
Held back by cloak-and-dagger oppression

We're insulting our own intelligence
I won't listen without any evidence
I'll live my life in the name of no one
Bow your head, palm to palm
Worship here in this cerebral cathedral

As day breaks, the sunlight heals
As day breaks, the light reveals
These chains that we've been living in...;
How easily we've been giving in!

Now shed this skin and let change begin...;

As day breaks, the sunlight heals
As day breaks, the light reveals

Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking

It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking
Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn, relieve the friction

Blue hours quicken the pulse
Upon the upper edge, reality dawns!

Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn, relieve the friction

Eyes roll back, chemical despair

Still I sleep alone at night
In years you'll thank me
For getting everything right
I am the sun
Still I sit alone in a red sky
Keeping my eyes on you
Were all alone

In time you'll find that
Were all on our own (all on our own)
Were all on our own , chasing nothing
My dreams have fallen , I'm wearing thin
I need something to fill this void I'm constantly in
And I can't do this

I am your hero
I just don't care tonight
In years you'll forget me
I got everything right
I am the sun
I didn't rise today
I left you in darkness

And I just don't care anymore about you
You can sit and suffer alone without me

I am your hero
Save your "thank you"'s

In times to come ill rise above this
But for now I can't ill just sit here
My dreams have fallen once again

We brought the battle, we saw the signs
We've found ourselves two steps behind

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

You've got to watch your back
You've got to swallow fear
Cover your tracks or you might disappear
They found the words to speak unspeakable things
They struck the air from the chests of kings

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea...
Would you run and hide or stand for what you believe?
Maybe Orwell was right all along...
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun

Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we've seen this all before

We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank, oh

They say, "The more things change, the more they stay the same"
Whilst the liars leech, the crooked preach
So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it
In beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?

You fucking parasite

There's no room in here for an honest man
Only callous and cold hearts

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we've seen it all before

Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand
Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand

An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vulture posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become
You are the reason we are bitter and then some

Bitter and then some

They sing of saviors, we sing of sorrow
But we're still holding on for dear life

Say what you like, I know what I am
Sometimes a flood starts with a leak in the dam
You said we'd never make a difference
Maybe this battle is to fight indifference?

Naysayer

Naysayer, hammer the nail
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

With every concession, another piece of us dies
Will we fight for nothing if not our lives?
Apathy is our new messiah
Only He could let things get so dire

All the messengers found knives in their backs
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire
All the messengers found knives in their backs

I know it haunts you; it haunts me too
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Why are we fighting, when I'm just like you?

Hey, hey, they live this, day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist

This is where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold
You know they're here when the water is red
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread

A message etched on broken ships

Hey, hey, they live this, day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist

You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out

She's bleeding out

Their innocence is heaven sent
Their malevolence, it will not relent
A graveyard sits upon the shore
They won't swim together anymore

The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near
The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near

The devil is near

"If we're going to survive on this planet
We have to respect the right of all species to survive
For we need them more than they need us"

A message etched on broken ships
We'll be here till corruption quits
There is a voice though they cannot speak
Not yet ready to admit defeat

You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out
You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out

Where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold

If only you were here to hold my head above bloody waters
We could make it through
You turned your back on me and now I do the same to you
You made me feel so hollow
How can the man that you looked up to turn around and say three words that hurt more than you'll ever know
You don't know what it feels like to be in my shoes
You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor
This time there's no reason for me to turn around and scream for help
But if only you were here to hold my head above all those things you said to tie me down
I'm looking for forgiveness for something that I didn't even do
How can you call yourself and idol, a person to trust?
How can I look so high up when you're always holding me down?

There's a look on your face I would like to knock out
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Though we won't ever meet I remember your name

Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway

You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
That the cracks in your smile are beginning to show
Now the world needs to see that it's time you should go
There's no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow

Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can, so fuck you anyway

Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
So much crap coming out, it must take you all day

There's a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
When you look at yourself do you see what I see
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?

There's a time for us all and I think yours has been
Can you please hurry up 'cause I find you obscene
We can't wait for the day that you're never around
When that face isn't here and you rot underground

Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway

If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
'Cause your decapitating habits feel a little bit orgasmic
If I gave you a hatchet
It would be yours to have
I kind of like the feeling when you stab me in the back
Every time i see you
Look me in the eye
I look straight back
'Cause a part of me will die
If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back

If I had a pistol
It would be yours to have
You could shoot me in the head blow a hole in my back
If I gave you a pistol
I wouldn't need it back
You could aim between my eyes and I'd still be yours to have
Every time I see you
I've got the urge to cry
I'm holding back the tears
'Cause I know the reason why
If I had a pistol
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

If I had an army
It would be yours to reign
People think I'm crazy but the pain is worth the pain
If I gave you an army
It would be your command
Kick me to the ground break both my bands
Every time your hurt me
I want you even more
I'll never win the battle and I'll never win the war
If I had an army
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

Every time I see you
Look me in the eye
I look straight back
'Cause a part of me will die
If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back

Look me in the eye

How many years have we waited for a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted chasing a love that was not our own?
I sat ashore and watched as one hopeless wave crashed upon another
While my thoughts ran to the highest hills my heart never, never reached the sea
With only delusions of an endless journey I am left with an ocean between you and me
An ocean between

Is this your salvation? Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection of someone else's dream

Yeah

The gate to my heart has been weld shut with the splendor of my aspirations closed in
How many years have we waited for a ship that never set sail?
And how many days have we wasted chasing a love that was not our own?
Is this your salvation?

Is this your salvation? Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection of someone else's dream

Before we were born they shaped our lives
Leading us into an unmarked grave
In moments life could end
So I will speak while I can

This is my chance
My time to stand

We may fail alone but that is better
Than dying with them only to be forgotten
I for one would rather suffer now
Than leave this life without passion

This is our chance
Our time to stand

Rah!
You sat and watched
As I nearly destroyed myself
Never had I felt so betrayed
That you would sacrifice my life
For no more than your comfort.

And now your love means nothing, nothing to me,
Your love means nothing to me.
Nothing to me.

You are a coward the antithesis of a friend,
Take action before there is no one left to defend.

For I would have stood by you,
For I would have stood by you,
Right to the gates of hell.

For I would have stood by you,
Right to the gates of hell.
Right to the gates of hell.

Yeahoh

I've looked straight into your eyes and turned my head for the last time
Because I was scared to leave these walls in ruin like the fate of those who trust in themselves
We are alone and afraid

I know YOU are the one we've left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
YOU're the one we've left behind
YOU're the one we've left

I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget YOU
YOU are the one we've left behind
YOU are the forsaken

Yeah

We've built our confidence on broken dreams now left for dead
Yet we've been condemned, yet we've been condemnde to chase these dreams that never end

I know YOU are the one we've left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
YOU're the one we've left behind
YOU're the one we've left behind

I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget YOU
YOU are the one we've left behind
YOU are the forsaken

I will, I will no longer turn my head
I will, I will never forget YOU
YOU are, YOU are the one we've left behind
YOU are, YOU are the forsaken

Our selfishness consumes us until the whole world is not enough
Forgive the day that I erased, that I erased YOUR name, that I erased YOUR name
For it's the memory of me that will decay

I know YOU are the forsaken
Somehow we are the ones who feel alone
I know YOU are the forsaken
Somehow we are the ones who feel alone

I never wanted and I never cared before.

I never wanted and I never cared before.
Take it back, this is a new day.
I never wanted and I never cared before.
Take it back, this is.

How I long to regress
To the days before I took upon myself
: The obsessions of this world
: A day of innocence equating beauty
: And tomorrow may fall
: And today is already gone
Tomorrow may fall
Today is already gone.

Take it back, this is a new day.
I never wanted, this is a new day.
And I never cared before.
I never wanted,
I never wanted,
And I never cared before.

I've grown tired of chasing
Convinced I was in need
And now the years I've spent
Only a slave to this.
Tomorrow may fall
And today is already gone,
I will no longer adore
These things that will never satisfy me.

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came.

In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die.
In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die.
To die.

This world was never worthy but how can I call it unfaithful?
Every promise was fulfilled as decay crawled from its throat
Like the dead rising from an open grave
Like the dead rising from an open grave

Lips of splendor, tongue of deceit
All dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there's nothing left

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there's nothing left

Nothing left, nothing left
There's nothing left
Nothing left

If all my sorrow has led me here then I would cry all of my tears
To have this chance, to have this chance again
To have this chance, to have this chance
And know there's more than this and know there's more than you

But what about the battle within us? (Yeah)
If we have chosen to live against the grain

I can only imagine that wrath is being held out
So there will be time for us to be redeemed
But surely wrath is not being held out
So that we may redeem ourselves
For I've seen the madness
Of those who died trying
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
I long to see their faces
Regardless of the decay
For in the eyes of the deceased...

We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still beauty
Inside this dying world

For what good is there holding off wrath
If we are determined
To bring wrath upon ourselves

Go!

The Truth of my heart
is like a repressed tale

A censored and silenced story
Repression or restraint
It is a delicate balance
Between bleeding out what
will make me drown
And closing in what I cannot afford to spill
Either way, I must cauterize, cauterize the open wound

I'm caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
or stuffed into a cell
or stuffed into a cell

And if these are the only options
This will be always be hell
Never ending
Though I still may be breathing
There is no quality of life
So I choose to risk it all for you
For you to be by my side

I'm caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
or stuffed into a cell
or stuffed into a cell

A crowd is easy to deceive
But now I am a patient on the table
I'll give you the knife
Cut away as you see fit
Just promise me the patience
To wait for me to heal


I'm caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
Or stuffed into a cell
Or stuffed into a cell
Or stuffed into a cell

Fighting so hard to be heard
Yet having nothing to say
You talk about changing masses
But forget those close to you

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

You can justify almost anything
If you are willing to be loud enough
But once you've spent everything
To change the world around you
Even if your voice is taken away
Such actions will still inspire

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

Now you've earned the right to be heard

Whose only concern is mere distraction

Like a swarm of flies colliding with a moving windshield
So are our lives on this never-ending road
I have left behind my mark only to later be washed away
And was consumed with the allure despite the inevitable decay

When did the road that I'm on become my only home?
When did this become the one place I truly know?
(I truly know)

A journey making us like weeds
Where the wind steals our splendor
But spreads it to the distant fields
Despite our fragile imperfections
Yet shaking walls and wearing wheels
Can never capture my heart the way you do

When did the road that I'm on become my only home?
(my only home)
When did this become the one place I truly know?

I am missing what makes me whole

I fought who I am inside
Until I wanted, I wanted to die
Instead of finding balance I found hatred
Consumed by failures and ignoring my own strengths
Pushed out to sea without learning to swim
Or stranded in the desert with no lungs to breathe

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything

How can I be expected to readily be content
With a view of life that has rejected
The basis of what has helped me to survive?
And replaced them with precepts
Rather than instruction
Full rule is an illusion (illusion)
All I can do is contain selfishness
And unveil what little power we may have

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything (everything)

Tearing away my flesh before taking
The time to understand it
A miracle may not be the answer
(tearing away my flesh)
When anchoring first on what I have
(before taking the time to understand it)
The ability to change

Like being stranded in the desert
With no lungs to breathe

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything (everthing)

All these moments of pain
Must add up to something
Our bodies have been trained to keep it all in
But our hearts still hold on

Some say to release it, forget about your past
Instead we count the cost, it's part of us
That doesn't mean that we cannot move on
It's just a memory of what we once were

No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
We can overcome

Why rid of fuel that can make us stronger
When properly put behind us? (put behind us)
And in the same way that
Everything good in life can be taken away
So can all this pain

No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we've faced in this life
We can overcome

Trying to forget is a burden we can never bear
When facing trials openly
There's nothing left to hide
New paths of strength come alive

We can overcome

No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we've faced in this life
We can overcome

Your resilience inspires me
Facing tragedies I will never face
Your presence is humbling
To think of all that you have overcome
It took such little pain
For our lives to coalesce
Finding what I could've found in no one else

You bring me through the darkness of myself
And show me that frailty can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

From the outside I've deceived the world
With false bravery
Yet you have taught me so much more
Much more than I can ever teach
And someday you might
Need someone to lean on

I can only hope that I'll have gained the courage
To be there for you in whatever you face
You bring me trough (you bring me through)
The darkness of myself
And show me that frailty (can be turned)
Can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

At times I'm carried on the shoulders of a child
I find power in your firm fallibility
My source of hope is seeing that weak prevail
And I'm better able to live because you're alive
I could not imagine a world without you
Where I looked you in the eyes and left you to die

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

The storm is coming and I have a choice
To accept nature or lose my voice
Shall I scream and plead for nothing
Or build a roof over my head?
I mourn the days that I wasted
Trying to change what has been set
Fighting against myself

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I'll just admit they're part of me

I've labelled enemies who do not hate me
And then claims friends who could care less
All an unnecessary struggle
So now I know what it means to repent
Changing everything

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I'll just admit they're part of me
(they're part of me)

Instead of fighting against myself
I will open my eyes
To find who needs me
I am awakened
I am awakened

If simple honesty moves me, then why should I care?
Others may think I lost my poetic way (I've lost my way)
But I'd rather make my point without confusion

I have failed those who I love the most
And in the process become aware

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know
I have accepted my limitations

It is that knowledge that opens the door
For greater understanding
Perspective on what is still untold

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I'll never know
I have accepted my limitations

Sorting out my thoughts, that is why I write
Though I reveal my weakness surrendering is remedy
These songs have helped me though my greatest pain
Unwound within me the disorder of my life

I now see things for how they are
Even if that is a harsh reality

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I'll never know
I have accepted my limitations

There are days when sorrow seems never-ending
Like the countless roads upon which I've driven
The price of attachment in pursuit of dreams
That I so often can't seem to remember
Yet there are days when beauty cannot be contained
It even crawls out from under ordinary things

A foreigner, no place to go
Holding on, making the most
Of what little time I have

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret

I will not leave wishing I had done things differently

The moments I treasure are seldom the ones
That I planned for
And if I knew where pain hid I might still let it go
So when the audience has run toward the latest drift
It will be my time to face the life that I have set

A foreigner in my own home
Holding on, no place to go

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret (regret)
All the wasted words

Some days the line between peace
And pain seems more like a blur
But I know with certainty
I can't leave wishing, I cannot leave
I can't leave wishing I'd done things differently

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret (regret)
All the wasted words

i looked at your cold white face

yet i knew you were at rest
much more comforted than I

Shadows are security.

They have become the solace of my looking glass heart.
In search for certainty, I no longer need control.

Take me through the fire, refine what is Yours.
It is time to overcome this.
We must look past what is in front of us.

i've watched them build
upon these empty hearts
false hopes of lossless paradise
gathering together
the dead hearts beat as one
stillborn comfort feeding lies
through answers of self denial
divided between a dissolute self
and the sorrow of sincere devotion
what is it that you find peace in now
where is your hope in this dark night

how could i ever go back?
back to the life where i lived amongst the dead
those who have forgotten how to feel
and become slaves to memory and wishful thinking
but your love has set me free
as you awaken every star that has been sleeping in the constellation of my soul
how could i go back to live amongst the dead
those who imprisoned beauty
i never want to leave your arms
so i wait in hope for your embrace
illusions of what i thought was love
now i have clear sight to see that i have left nothing behind

Can we die to live another day

how could we lose sight
of what matters most
trying to love
what cannot love us back
all we have is not worth living for
if we do not know when to let go
Can we die to live another day
what is this life
that we cling to it so tight
afraid that it will take from us
these fading sentiments
can we die to live another day

I have traveled so far to find so little
meaning in tragedy or tragedy
in the search for meaning
dark clouds have lead me here
confined freedom
guides us to security
what if everything
I have been taught is a lie and all of my teachers
have been wrong this whole time
compelling us to fight
the battles they would not
they have already won
and we have already lost
if we do not learn from their mistakes
we have already lost
if we don't learn to change

All along it was me who changed.
Morning now waits for me.

If what I give is all to You.

And the sun rise again,
But You are yet to change.
You are all that is worth living for.

I laid the night before me
Unraveled that tangles of my heart
All I felt was stale hollow air
These streams of uncertainty
They are all collapsing upon my mind
Torrents fill my veins until I burst
With mistaken guilt and shame
My battered bones
Try to keep fighting
Against this endless ocean of self defeat
As time goes on
Some months are yet to pass
Puddles of ink
Surround this tired chair
All of my sorrow has been spilled
Into my reflection

This is what I am, this is what I have become:

Drain me of my very essence to form again what lasts

This is what I am, this is what I have become
What is love, what is love
What is love without sacrifice?
My tears hold no weight
If my commitments is only failure, is only failure

Repeat yesterday

Each day I am born, I am born again to be, again to be
A child, a child in the eyes of love
Repeating yesterday, repeating
Drain me of my very essence to form, to form again
To form, to form again what lasts

This is what I am, this is what I have become
What is love, what is love
What is love without...?

For so long I have felt alone
Content to live with unrest
Longing faded into countless
Nights that buried my weary heart

But you brought an end to this dead hour
And meaning to a calloused life
Held in your arms but too far from my heart
Held in your arms but too far from my heart

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
Mine

I remember the way you looked
At me and the way you drew me close
With one deep sigh scattering
Pieces of my restless mind
Forgetting all that we have left behind

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me

While shutters enclose the boundaries of my heart.
I hold my breath till the steady beating is shut out.
In silence I wait for what is real.
For I know the truth of my perception.
Nothing in life matters more, more than You.
Nothing more, more than You.
When first feelings fade,
I will still be here.

I've tried to find reconciliation behind the walls of those whose hatred burns.
For I find it easier to reach someone who still feels,
Than to make amends with passionless apathy.
Where all lines are the same a portrait cannot be made.

I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive.

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.

Like a colorless sky over a sea of nothingness,
Hatred faces its enemies while apathy strikes furtively.

I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive.

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.
I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand...

Until our anger burns against injustice, we will create
The faceless by dismissing those forced to concede.

Many of us have turned off the light outside, erasing what exists beyond our front door.
And for you I find it harder to reach common ground than my most glaring opposition.
But what about those who've lost the luxury of choice?
...striving for identity, buried by our lack of interest, souls marked as mere history.
How much grievance will it take to awaken us?

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.
I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger

How much grievance will it take to awaken us from the comfort of our homes?

None of this matters, none of these words. Common and silent we will die in this world.
We've only spoken to those who agree, and without them we've fallen on deaf ears.

Stand on conviction and you will walk alone.

For once I have stood (I have stood), no one will know,
But alone I was born and alone we must go.

In my convictions I've found my own grave, but amongst the dead we all fade away.

Yeah...
Yet solitude is better than a life not worthy of reaction.
There is nothing to lose (nothing). So we stand alone or join those who follow in misery.

In my convictions I've found my own grave, but amongst the dead we all fade away.

Stand on conviction and you'll walk alone.
A voice is only a noise without someone to hear,
And without a crowd to feed that noise grows silent.

For once I have stood, no one will know, but alone I was born and alone we must go.
Fading back into an anodyne sea, to drown with all who've gone before me.

Yeah... We must go.

What we see now is only a fraction...

Bound to learn the hard way
This is the human condition
There is nothing that can be said
To stop us from making mistakes
When I look to myself as a source of ending pain
No matter how many times before I've failed

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond us to those truly in hell

The more I focus on myself
Then the more helpless that I become
So why not erase this point of view?
My suffering is trivial (Beyond our suffering)
Compared to those who know real agony

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering

My trials seem insignificant now

Why won't we look beyond us?
Why won't we look beyond our despair?
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look to those truly in hell

Personal redemption cannot change the world
Unless we lay down our lives for those who still suffer

Betrayal of those who are forgotten, yet vision alone furthers our blame.
Unless followed by transformation, it is pointless to be given sight.

Just like the spread of disease.... Ya... Ya...
Debt and guilt or guilt and decree, the masters that we please.
Yet if we seek help for infirmities, we are made twice the sons of hell as before.

Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, only to be plagued by disease.
Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, only to be plagued by disease.

While religion tries to blame what we cannot see, I accept that part of the problem is me.
It was never a sacred mandate to accept conformity,
Through select revelations that we choose to believe.

Another blind guide replacing divine eyes.

Familiarity is the great deception, disguised by authority, sealing out subversion.

Whitewashed tombs have hidden the truth, for we unknowingly worship icons of ordinary life.

Reach out your hand to find forgiveness, only to be plagued by disease.
The horrors of beliefs and customs, camouflaged by commonality.

Reach out your hand, reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, reach out your hand.

I still believe that there is hope for us, but I believe we must look outside
The sanctuaries of oppression that have brought our world so much pain....

Many choose to find their hope in the thoughts of afterlife
When there is none to be found right here before we die
So I understand the feeling of helplessness
When we are just taught to wait here, wait here for death

Wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end
Wait here for death, wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end

We are not forgotten, for a kingdom is offered beyond that of golden streets
We can represent now what will one day be complete

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned

Wait here for death, wait here for death
The "blessings" of excess are only a burden on us

It is a broken system where we just wait for death
It is a broken system where suffering can never end

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned, the broken are crowned

If helplessness is our system then we're better off upside-down

We live in slavery to a past we cannot escape, and I say it's worth it to just start again... again.

We've focused so long on ideals of freedom that it is this very belief that oppresses us.
We all want to be free, yet we find ways to forfeit liberty
To our own impulses, to our own consumption.

So I say it's worth it to build a new foundation... a new foundation...
A new foundation... a new foundation... It's a past we cannot escape.

This vacancy will take everything this world can offer.
But what is control once we have let go of all we suffer? Once we've let go...

Yeah... When we've awakened to admit we are all enslaved,
Then there is freedom in our choice to disobey. Yeah...
Our creeds have become a justification (justification) to live the way that some see fit,
(justification) and no one is more hopeless than those blinded by the scales of content.

If we chase acclaim in search for...search for stature,
Then our status becomes a vacuum draining. Opulence is a myth for there is no final rest.
Change in circumstance only delays. The inescapable fact that we are downcast.

In looking to the end we've lost sight of where to begin.

Hope lies not in reaching...reaching the end, if the journey itself is enough to bring fulfillment.

Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final rest.
Without conclusion... Shred...

We are void of purpose before we start.
For in chasing our destination the present state is sacrificed... sacrificed.
In looking to... In looking to the end we have lost sight of where to begin.

Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
There's nothing but pain left here I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Three years of torment and torturous love
Stained with tears and mistrust, enough is enough
I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in
'Cause your heart is too weak for me to break it again
All the mistakes that I've made
You forgave, what the fuck? You shouldn't have stayed
You'd always said "There's so much love in you"
I can't believe that you can't see that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left here I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Do you remember the beginning? Heartbeats one and the same?
Living smitten in Texas, burning bright as a flame
So young and in love, no care what anyone said
'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turned dead

What went so wrong with me? Why did I break this?
Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see
That we were perfect 'til I turned around
And gave in to debauchery
This is your chance to escape this
My goodbye with a last kiss
'Cause I know deep down you know that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be

A boy of anguish now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him, no he won't let them go
Lays awake try'na find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

I can't believe I've come so far in such short time

I hope they kill you all
I hope I never see your faces again
I wanna watch the whole world burn down
I wanna watch the world burn
I wanna watch the whole world burn down

I won't pretend I'm not disgusted with everything you are
I won't deny that I'm revolted by everything you say you stand for
Where do I go? What do I say? Where do I draw the line?
Can I move on? Can I let go before I lose my mind?
Am I alone after everything we've suffered through?
Feels though what once was us has dwindled down to me and you

These words they fall off my tongue like a poison
I hope they kill you all
I hope I never see your faces again
I wanna watch the whole world burn down
I wanna watch the world burn
I wanna watch the whole world burn down

This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free

Run free and wild, lose your mind, escape your inhibitions
Taste the wind, let your hair down and throw your hands up
Go, go, go, let go, forget the consequences
Go, go, go, let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world

This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free

Run free and wild, lose your mind, this world's yours for the taking
Open wide, scream it loud "This is my life"
Go, go, go, let go, forget what came before
Go, go, go, let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world

Close your eyes and pray for something bigger than this world has to give
Make it worth your time when you move on to whatever the hell is next
Know that you went in the end without a single regret
That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and followed your dreams

You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid
Run free and wild, let your heart soar with the eagles
Run free and wild, let your love take over
You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid

Album  From Death To Destiny
Am I insane? I ask myself over and over and over again
Flies in my brain pouring out from the cracks in my skull
Am I alone? Surrounded by sin and I think I might just be suffocating
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

Am I insane? I fold myself over and scream 'til I'm spitting blood
Flies in my brain the itching is incomprehensible and it won't stop
Am I alone? The voices grow fainted but they just won't fucking go away
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
Am I alone? Surrounded by death, I think this might just be the end
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

You can't take this away from me, you can't relieve these demons
You can't make this okay for me, you're the ones who caused these feelings
I apologize for what I'm about to do
I tried to sympathize but at the end of the day you brought this on yourselves

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

The tears have left a blur that I can't explain
The pain has left a hole in which my heart should have been
I'm blind with rage and I can't shake this feelings
Irrational, impetuous, intemperate

I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

Street signs, so many street signs pass me by every night and
I know tomorrow I won't recognize the world
Home bound, but I want to be home now
Two more months of empty faces standing there screaming up at me
And I don't know why

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road

Save me, can anyone save me?
I don't know who I am anymore
This was supposed to be the dream
You don't see the pain in my eyes?
You don't hear the pain in my words?
I'm just stuck here cold and alone with no one beside me
And I wanna go home

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road

And you wonder why I'm out of my mind?

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road

As I breathe my disease brings me to my knees
All you need is a taste, it'll set you free
Your infection's my discretion honey, one and the same
Counting second 'til I'm medicated, fucked in the brain

I don't want this baby, I just need it to carry on

I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in

I sold my soul

Licking every drop of poison off a pocket of keys
While some daddy's little angel's getting dirt on her knees
When the sun goes down, the filth roam free
You'll never find a finer specimen of filth than me

I don't want this, I just need this to carry on

I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in

I sold my soul

Some have said that I'm the devil and it's just as well 'cause
I've been through and burned down and rebuilt hell
With my heart in a vice and a knife in my back
I've got a noose for the world that I'm painting black

I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in

Help me, please

Please, give me a fucking excuse
I beg for just one reason to give you regret, regret

Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side, so choose your side
Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side, so choose your fucking side

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh

Hear me now
Get off your knees
Nothing changes when you pray
I'm the closest thing to a God you'll ever know
Get off your knees
Open your eyes

I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you

I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you

And I can't feel this pain anymore
And I can't carry on this way
I'm hiding behind false eyes

I'm so done with it, I won't go back again and
I'm okay with this, that I'll be on my own
Until the day I die, which shouldn't be that long
So I'll just do what I do and make the most of it

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive
Made it out alive

Oh fuck, this is fun I just can't believe
I didn't find this before
To just indulge even if it kills me
Who gives a fuck if we die?

Who gives a fuck if we die?
Who gives a fuck if we die?

Another bottle down

You should really try it sometime
'Cause it feels so good

You should really try it sometime
'Cause it feels so good

Without a care if a heart gets broken
You'll all learn in the end, there's a better way
Baby move in closer, you couldn't hurt me if you tried

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

Take a seat, my dear
Make yourself comfortable, this could take a while
Crack another, dear
I can't see now and I wouldn't change a thing
Life should burn with such a fucking flame
If not you've only got yourself to blame

Get the fuck away from me

I know that I have done wrong and continue to do so but without remorse
I know that I am on a fast track to the grave and I'm headed there alone

I struggle to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man with a conscience
I fight to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man that is not me

I spend my days looking through pages
Try to find a way to get away from me
A love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find a way back inside my mind

I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you save yourself

Yeah

I spend my days looking through pages
Try to find a way to get away from me
A love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find a way back inside my mind

I need to find
A way back inside my mind
I need to find
A way back inside my mind

This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end

Every mistake I've made leaves a scar that burns every day
Yet still I carry on
Without regret without remorse, I'm gone
You're better off to walk away
I am corruption, I am sin

Forget my name
Forget my face
Forget my name
Forget my face

Go

We're back again, you know we're not fucking around
Got a bottle of jack in our hands, you tryna' keep up kid?
Let's see who hits the ground
We've drank the drinks, we've done the drugs, clearly we don't remember
We've come so far, we've shown them all, without us you'd fall and fade away

They say it all breaks down to keeping your feet on the ground
My sole intention is keeping my head in the clouds
They say that I can't last a day in the real world
I say you wouldn't survive one night in mine

Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit

Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit

You can't help but love this shit

I'm everything we need to make this scene what it should have been
Remember platinum albums, sold out stadiums, leave it to me
Let's tell the truth, not to be rude but we're all irrelevant
This music's dead with a bullet in its head
Let's wake it up

It's so insane, I'm so insane
Going insane, I'm so insane

To the white hills and the oceans

We're doomed to this now
Oh, the irony
If I'm going down I won't go down alone
You're doomed to this one

Hold your breath my dear
We're going under, we're going under

Hold your breath my dear
We're going under, we're going under

I've walked this road for hours
To the white hills and the oceans
I search for solace in this toxic land of sin
Just let me in
Don't wake me up, their songs are soothing
Their wine subdues me

Hold your breath my dear
We're going under, we're going under

Hold your breath my dear

Dreams, my mind won't me lift from my dreams
And though I tried I can't escape my mind
Dreams, my mind won't lift me from my dreams
And though you try you can't escape me

Now you've seen what I've become
Now you've seen what I can do
Now you've seen what I'm capable of

I've walk this road for hours
To the white hills and the oceans
I search for solace in this toxic land of sin
Just let me in

You'll never really find those perfect words
Something more than just... "Goodbye"

It's hard to remember the good times when there's just so much heartache
But they deserve more than that
They deserve more than just one single moment of sadness

So just remember that when there's enough love in our hearts
To burst like a fucking supernova
And there sure as hell's enough love in our heart to spark that famous smile

We all lose someone at some point in our lives
But don't ever let go of that smile

Hold on forever
Because that's our final dedication

Son, you are forsaken
Condemned for the sins that you live
I offer you forgiveness

So he came forth and said unto me
Son, you are forsaken
Condemned for the sins that you live
I offer you forgiveness

Bow down before me
Bow down before me

I'll never bow to he who claims to be divine
I'll tear down your gates with bare fucking hands
And burn the world that you rule over
No matter how convinced you are, you're not a god of mine
You're not a fucking god of mine

I never believed in you
From what I see it was justified
I never believed in you
In you

This power over the masses is a gift you don't deserve
When your blood spills, we'll drink from your skull
You can run, you can hide

Bitch
I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your eyes out of your self-righteous face

Lord
I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your tongue out of your rancid fucking mouth

Heaven will burn to the fucking ground
Your world will crumble, and fall from the skies
Blood will spill, and rain upon the Earth
Your reign is over, and I'll wear your crown

This is your demise
I know you feel it in your chest
This is your demise
It's getting closer
This is your demise
I'm creeping from the depths of hell
This is your demise
I know where you sleep

I never believed in you
From what I see it was justified
I never believed in you
In you

What a way to end the world
What a way to end

What a way to end the world
With false hope in a false god
What a way to end the world
With false hope in you

What a way to end the world
With false hope in a false god

Through sin and self-destruction I stumble home, never alone
My only home is the bottom of a bottle and a rolled up bill and I'm ready to go
I live the same day in and out and I don't care how long I last
All the girls and drink and drugs, but don't get me wrong
I'm having a fucking blast

I am rock and roll
Living a life you can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
I guess I'm never gonna learn

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
I guess I'm never gonna learn

Not gonna stop until my heart stops beating
Not gonna stop until my last breath comes
I'm gonna go until I hit the floor and I can't find a way back to my feet anymore

Pass me a glass and let's destroy everything in this fucking place
Life at 300 miles an hour
You pussies can't keep up with this fucking pace

I've spent the last two years tearing apart my soul
I'll put the next two in to kick-start the good old days of rock and roll

You hit the nail on the head with the back of your fucking throat

I'll be the end of her, I'm in her head and in control

You've made the slip now take the fall
I pull your strings, you're too deep in
So will she sink or swim?

Ladies and gentlemen
Place your fucking bets
Here we come

Oh, she's down, how very spectacular
What a work of art I've spawned
Man am I proud of myself on this one

She's such a fucking masterpiece
Self-destruction is such a pretty little thing

I know that I should walk away
But I can't bring myself to quit this game
She's just a beautiful girl
With the weight of the world on her shoulders
I'm just a kick in the teeth
From a world that's painted gold

Turn the fucking tables

She's out the door, she's on her ass again

Give me all you've got
Make this night worth my time

cause I can see the sun the end is near I'm feeling high ...
How fast can I run?
Risin', risin' to the top
the pills are ready to be dropped
1, 2, 3 and 4 - Got the joker shoot the score!

Speed! Just wouldn't believe it!

Tomorrow, tomorrow, always tomorrow
There is no future in the western dreamin'!
We feel it, we must beat 'em !
It's too late to create a new world!
Alternative living it must be given a chance!
Water the problem's solution! No solution if you can't use it!

And then I heard the siren of the police!
My blood went up to 90 degrees!
You can't see white cats in the snow
Oh human being, how low can you go?
Risin', risin' to the top
the pills are ready to be dropped
1, 2, 3 and 4
Got the joker shoot the score!

Speed! Just wouldn't believe it!

It's a dangerous place
And you don't know how to behave.

She killed her heart
She took his soul
I'ma sergeon of cutting
It all feels numb
When you can't wash off that smell
You really don't want to live
You really just want to,
You really just want to.

So much blood, so much blood
So much blood, so much blood
Too much blood, too much blood.

Where'd you get your delusions from?
1 2 3 4
Where'd you get your delusions from?
Where'd you get your delusions from?

Blood in my eyes, i get blood in my eyes
I get blood in my eyes
I get....
Blood in my eyes, blood in my eyes
I get blood in my eyes, i get blood in my eyes,
Reconstructive surgery
And can specify how old you want to be.
Snake heads, snake heads, they're just snake heads
Because you just talk anyway!

When men stop mutilating their favorite girls
Then something scary has been let loose among us
But i feel like an explosion of
Too much blood!

Where'd you get your delusions from?
Where'd you get your delusions from?
Come on!
Where'd you get your delusions from?
Where'd you get your delusions from?

Blood in my eyes, i get
Blood in my eyes, i get
Blood in my eyes, i got ..
Blood in my eyes, blood in my eyes.

I saw the reflection of the hellfire
With my own eyes
I do whatever feels right
It comes at a high price

In this game you die the moment you freeze
But always remember
When we've overcome our fears
We'll truly be free

Getting closer
We're getting closer

Go

We'll reach the goal
Getting closer

It's a thrill, it's a rush, it's a suicide pill
A beggar on a corner tells me about Jesus
While a skeleton in a fur coat
Being driven in a limousine

We all live for that perfect moment
Dangerous, it's so much fun
Cause when you've woken up you see
When you've woken up you see

Street demon
Fly, fly, fly
Everything slows down
There is no time

Getting closer
I will make it, I will make it, I will make it
I will make it, I will make it

Erase your face

I get out of the house and walk towards the station
It's dark, deserted, I'm feeling lonely but connected
Every move is being recorded and I know it
But my anger is a gift
And my biggest secret is that I actually stopped existing

I'm surprised how indifferent so many feel about the surveillance scandal
Look up Germany's history
I have spoken to people who lived in Nazi and eastern socialist Germany
The spying on your life by the state is one thing but what it does to your friends and family in the long run is beyond anything you can imagine right now
You lose trust in people you love, every conversation becomes half lie / half truth
It becomes part of everybody's lives
Nobody is an exception
Ignore music, games or whatever you do right now and research the topic
Anything you have said in the past can be twisted against you in a surveillance state
Made the wrong joke in private?
You are constantly being blackmailed by those in charge
History has shown that these types of societies never last
They get so corrupted with lies that many people will suffer in the end
Everybody loses

They keep an eye on every move
Organized puppets fools, fiction on a screen
Lost in the freedom we found
Greed and control, cameras on everything

The watching eye, government spies
Paid to tell lies and in the end who wins
Pow so it all falls down
It all falls down

Hell on earth
Man created the devil and the devil created the excuse
To justify the killings
That we don't see on the news
And I wonder: Will history repeat itself?
When they're numbering you

They'll try to hurt you
Through the good they see in you
Don't let it break you
Don't let it break you

They'll try to punish you
For the good they see in you
They know they need it
Don't let it break you

Knock, knock mocking bird stop bang
And another one's down
Fuck your 2 seconds and we lay down flat
Face to the ground, face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we'd be face to the ground
Face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we'd be face to the ground
So we can't back down

The world is far from being safer
Cypher spend you life in danger
Prosecute me
How can a man exist in this and still be free?
Third eye is eternally on standby

And I know for sure that I can't trust you anymore

They're loading their guns and marching the streets
A flag with no meaning, a religion of deceit

Waiting for the air to get cold

Of pressure is pressure is pressure

Standing on a rooftop, staring down
The sound of a helicopter approaches from far away
Traffic below, stars above

A copy of a man of a copy

Stranded, it couldn't drive me insane

Darkness would end this life

There are no re restrictions to who you can be

You are the one

Don't let them tell you you're nothing
Because you know it isn't true

You matter not because of who you once were
Or where you came from
You matter because of who you are in this moment

You control your convictions, character and values

They frame you, they limit you
Before you can take your chance

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"

For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
"Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"

We are the ghosts of the midway
The beasts of the alley
We are the living dead
Living in your nightmares

Scraping ourselves from the earth
Living as though we are dirt
Staring like you've seen a ghost
The lowest of the low with nowhere to go

Back from the dead, now we're groveling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets
Back from the dead, now we're groveling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets

Fighting for your attention, begging for your generosity
Looking up just to see you turn your cheek on me
You walk on by like I'm invisible, invisible
All I want is to be seen as an equal

We fought your battles and we built your homes
Sorry if I disturbed you, I just wish we could live like you do

Even in our most beautiful days it's dark
Just look at the world around you
There's a consequence for what we do
Pass judgment on me as you walk
Picture perfect ain't my obsession
You can't sum up my life from a first impression

Learn your lesson

Act like you know me but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
Act like you know me but do you even know yourself?

Do you know how it feels to hide
With thoughts repressed deep down inside?
I guess you just loved the lie
Truth is, you can't decide where my heart resides

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
And cast aside from the man that I am

I've never felt so free
It kills me to hear you say you "choose to love me"
I was hoping that would be a given, given our history
I've never felt so free, so free

You think I'm wrong, you think I'm wrong
But I never felt better

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better
Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better

I know I disappointed you
But I've got nothing to prove

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
But now I've realized this is who I am

You're either with or against me
You're either with or against me

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie

You think I'm wrong but I never felt better

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie

These windy streets tell of a different time
What got us here won't get us there
It's time for the upright to have insight
Don't forget what's important in life
This place is like a cage that will imprison you
Is comfort only found without adversity?
Anyone, anywhere in history, has confronted these realities

What got us here won't get us there
I'll be there soon that's why I care

Everyone you love will one day fade away
Everything you have will rot and decay
Everything around us will burn
Burn up in the death of the sun

It's in the pain that we see our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we are defined
When we're blind we will feel our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we leave our comfort behind

We are found in far away places, when all seems lost
We are found in far away places, not all is lost

We must be strong and cling onto hope (Cling onto hope)
We must be strong, when the ground is shifting out from under our feet

We are found in far away places when all seems lost
We are found in far away places when all seems lost

Stop majoring in the minors
It's when you get inside that is widens
Stay true tempered (Stay true tempered)
You're not the first to find life is tough

Circumstantial hope isn't really hope
It's just a watered down distraction from what stands in our way
Hope gives us the ability to face reality
The ability to see through it all

Demand what you will never deserve

Don't mask your pride with humility
While forcing others to keep proving their loyalty

You've been a hypocrite for years
Drawing swords as much as you draw their tears
Demand what you will never deserve
Respect is gained by trust shown and earned

You build your strength off of your anger
Fighting a selfish battle with no answer
Your transparency has started showing
Don't let fear guide you where you are going

You would die for everyone else
But you won't live for yourself

Do you mean what you say?
Do you say what you mean
Or will you find another lie
Another lie to hide behind?
Keep speaking to the world about
What you can't forget
You can't forget all the things you hold onto
Refusing to forgive those that hurt you

You're taking steps on a fine line
So you don't have to choose a side
Good deeds are not recognized
When the heart's intent is full of pride

Before the story begins, is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine until the end of time?
We were more than friends before the story ends
And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you.

I almost laughed myself to tears
Conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here, you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it

She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in

It goes on and on and on
And I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby don't cry

Possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it
(Eat the shit out of him)

Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must return back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
Cause I was all up in a piece of Heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby don't cry

(What will you do?)
I will suffer for so long
(Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, if it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

Coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
Yes, I do

Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
I do
I now pronounce you..

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah

Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here - so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

I see a distant light
But girl this can't be right...
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here!

Place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here - so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time... (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay
I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here!
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might, take me back inside
When the time is right!

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy!)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live!)

Aah!

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here!
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might, take me back inside
When the time is right!

I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways, and that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face, I may have forced the scale to tip

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me, It's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, It's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
It's hard to face but the fact remains, that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin, but deep inside I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall)
Come back again, it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right
(Make it alright)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, it's almost easy
(You learned your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But still you fall)
Come back again, it's almost easy

(Out of time...)
Doc, I'm dying, I'm feeling compromised (feeling compromised)
And so dehumanized (and so dehumanized)
I lost my final fight to disease, I feel that this is where it ends
I need that shot to enter my vein
My Brompton Cocktail blend

'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
In a lie...

I'm tired, induced euphoria (induced euphoria)
To help me move along (help me move along)
I wanna meet my maker in peace, I want to feel alive again
So put that smile back on my face and mix it strong my friend

'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
And I take my life tonight 'cause I have the right to die how I wanna
And leave how I arrived, so alive

I believe my sins have been forgiven
And I believe my choice will save me from this life
Please don't question why
My sins have been forgotten
I believe I'll find peace in afterlife
Please don't question why
I left this way

'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
And I take my life tonight 'cause I have the right to die how I wanna
And leave how I arrived, so alive
(Alive)

Yeah

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

So how does it feel to know that someone's kid in the heart of America
Has blood on their hands, fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain a lifestyle that insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute, we aim high in the air
Towards all the pompous assholes who spend their days pointing fingers
(Fuck you)

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your generous hypocrisy
Collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you've dug your own grave)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

All the way from the east to the west, we got this high society
Looking down on that very foundation, constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems, pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing to the country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see, try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person
Who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

There's nothing here for me
On this barren road
There's no one here
While the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of
The times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories
Will have to help me through
Oh yeah

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person
Who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade.

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away

Who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed

But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

Never let it show
The pain I've grown to know
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah

The stars in the night, they lend me their light
to bring me closer to heaven with you

Caught up in this madness, too blind to see
Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it's too late, you've wasted all your time, yeah

Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side, there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it's too late, you've wasted all your time

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong, but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it's too late, you've wasted all your time

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built, don't point the blame on me

Scream, scream, scream
The way you would if I ravaged your body
Scream, scream, scream
The way you would if I ravaged your mind

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all

Chances are that ya might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real

Still I'm on my way
(On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

I walk the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Follow dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall

Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
Ya know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real

Memories seem to fade
(On and on it goes)
Wash my view away

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever

And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

Take you down now, burn it all out
Throw you all around, get your fucking hands off me
What's it feel like? Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart now you're knocking at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll, a price for you alone
The only deal you'll find, I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick, sober up quick
Psycho lunatic crushing you with hands of fate
Shamed to find out, when it's too late
But you're all the same, trapped inside; Inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide, I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin, release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive

This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Die buried alive (let me take in your soul)

This is now your life
Die buried alive

My '16 locked and loaded
All fear has been aborted
You say the words and my weapon is drawn
This one could be my last time
Some people call it war crime
I may be staring down a lethal sight (to die)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line

I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know
With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me but never take us all (I'll crawl)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line

I know what you're thinking, I've been there before
So think of the times, the time we spent laughing away
So think of the times at home (life without a care)

Now I find myself in my own blood
(Never thought I'd lie in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair
I never put my faith in up above
(Never had much faith in up above)
But now, I'm hoping someone's there

I never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who cared
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no one said it's fair

Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I've sung my last song today
Remind the Lord to leave his light on for me
I'm free

How this world can overcome a man
Like a friend we saw it through
In the end I gave my life for you

Gave you all I had to give
Found a place for me to rest my head
While I may be hard to find
Heard there's peace just on the other side

Not that I could or that I would
Let it burn under my skin
Let it burn

Left this life to set me free
Took a piece of you inside of me
All this hurt can finally fade
Promise me you'll never feel afraid

Not that I could or that I would
Let it burn under my skin
Let it burn

I hope it's worth it here on the highway, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you
So tell everybody, the ones who walk beside me, yeah
I hope you'll find your own way when I'm not with you tonight

I hope it's worth it what's left behind me, yeah

One snap for the dying
One click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way

You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes anytime
Watch the clock till you unwind
You wanna cry about it
It's making me consider that I lost my mind
The way I see you must be blind

So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you cover me with manic fame

You wanna know about it?
But I'ma be fucking with you every time
Story broke and you're behind
And when you ask about it
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find

So this is the hate I've been born to
Full of the tales of the untrue

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

And I'm waiting, waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
And all the promises I'll find
No hesitating, you pull the trigger now your story's left behind
I know you wanna see me fry
Like my soul you won't survive

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

To die unknown
Would crush the fish lens we all see through
To kill the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true

An old acquaintance severed

Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head

We only, only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we find
Lost our way tonight (lost our way tonight)

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die

You hear me, let me know

Ever since the day you left my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Said help me find my way

No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and to a degree
Losing who I want to be
You'll find out right now

He may be out of his mind
But someday you will find
That sanity's left us all blind
And dragged us all behind

A moment seen through those eyes
Crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die
I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind
Then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind
And walked right through the door

I can see the pictures clear as yesterday
Pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay
But know you're not alone

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die

Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A life that healed a broken heart
With all that it could
Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart
With all that I could

Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place in time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find
A place in my mind

Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place in time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
'Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place in time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you're so far away

I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you when he lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied

So far away (So far...)
And I need you to know
So far away (So far...)
And I need you to, need you to know

Lost the meaning of our stay
Learn to live another day
Doubt the choices that we've made
I know that we can't hide our shame
It's only in disguise

Drowning in our own debris
Fool our thoughts as though we're free
Close our eyes so we can see
The depth of all we need to be
If only in my eyes

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
In a way

So try and numb me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
But I seem to find no better ways to consciously pretend

Silence all I want to say
With tendencies to run away
I'll run away with you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made, you know
Tonight the world dies

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)

House full of roses, a letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages for anyone who cares
Collage of broken words and stories full of tears
Remembering your life, 'cause we wish that you were here

Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay, it's the end of all you've known
Time keeps passing by, but it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind, but some too deep to feel

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Some days you'll find me in a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself about the things I'll never know
What's left to find? 'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time, can we even up the score?

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime, yeah, woah

Nothing lasts forever, for all good things, it's true
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you
It must have been the season that threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation with promises unkind
And all the speculation, save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason, a reason just to stay
Well some just can't be bothered to stick around another day

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
Ooh, we've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

Raus von hier, das Taube spüren
Nehm mir nie zuviel, bisschen für's Bauchgefühl
Die falschen Drogen zur richtigen Zeit
Werf 'n Schatten wo das Licht nie scheint, für kurze Zeit
Und übernehmen Straßen abends, immer Wasser bis zum Hals
Lieber Regenparka tragen
Sprachlos, tanzend statt reden
So müde von der Stadt die nie schläft, bleibt in Bewegung
Hörst du den Chor? Schief und doch schön
Höhen leicht daneben, wir sind Tiefen gewöhnt
Mit großen Augen zwischen Bahnschienen und Schrebergärten
Arm in Arm singend, über Leben die wir nie leben werden
So wie das Ding hier nunmal läuft
Kleinganoven beichten mit zwei Fingern über Kreuz
Wir sind Legenden, wir selbst
Gemeinsam vor'm Ende der Welt
Willkommen zuhaus'

Wo jeder Tag aus Warten besteht und die Zeit scheinbar nie vergeht, vergeht, vergeht
In diesem Hinterland, verdammtes Hinterland
Wo Gedanken im Wind verwehen und die Zeit scheinbar nie
Vergeht, vergeht, vergeht.
Geliebtes Hinterland, willkommen im Hinterland

Immer Steine schmeißen, Hauptsache laut
Für alles zu haben, zu kaum was zu gebrauchen
In diesen Hinterwelten getrieben von Kindergeld
Wenn Taten mehr sagen als Worte, sind die Stille selbst
Man gibt uns gut zu verstehen, die leeren Gläser der Theke sind beste Lupen aufs Leben.
Unter'm Haus der Straßenlaterne nun um elf
Gemeinsam am Ende der Welt
Willkommen zuhaus'

Wo jeder Tag aus warten besteht und die Zeit scheinbar nie vergeht, vergeht, vergeht

Vergeht, vergeht, vergeht

I accepted the subtle invitation in your beautiful green eyes
And pressed an ear to your ruby red lips...

"It's coming to get me", you whispered.
A button on your dress released itself
And the garment dropped to the floor.
The fussy eunoch had fumbled to cover your exposed shoulders
But you couldn't reach...

"Look...it wants to kill me!"
Understated, yet petrified...
You were appealing to my better side
Although the devil in me ached for satisfaction.

I dashed to the elevator...
Pressed the arrow and waited.

On my 13th floor balcony in this hollow hotel
I spied on the lobby below.
There's pandemonium.

Guns are trained...cops in corners.
Cops in visors...lines of shields...
And I swear I caught the eye of the beast.
Wrong.

As my would-be adversory turned from the counter, a dart flew into his forehead.
The guns rattled...the line of shields parted.
There was a distortion of spice like a ball of congealed air rolling at a massive speed...
Scattering bodies as it squeezed through the gap in the closed elevator doors.

And I turned to watch the illuminated number descend...
1...2...3...4...so slow it must grow angrier by the second...
8...9...10...
"It's coming to get me", you whispered...
But what the hell could I do about it?

I woke up.
I'm sorry.
And the radio at my bedside spat out the ever-worsening news:
Satan's in the White House!

React.
Reboot to the sound of a violent fart at a pretentious dinner party.
Let it pass.
I want to wake up again.

I couldn't save you, my lovely.
I cannot save myself.

It's coming to get me...

Could I rot, if life gave out?

See a vision

Reach at a high, altitude is on fire
Red again, read a lie
Everyone is on fires
I'm seeing it
I am seeing it

Aimed at his side
Cut across to divide
Up and down, what inside?
Hold on to a lie
You believe in it
You believe in it

Between a near
Somewhere over there
When I do try and fight
Can't recollect the evil deed
Sure wear those clothes
I'm washing out the blood I know
More tomorrow, our deafened lies
Look toward a frozen sky

The night of timeless fire is drawing near
I flee...
Throughout the years of throe
Watching through a mirror, as I fall apart
I see a wreck, I'm burning

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down I see me, I'm my own enemy

Watching myself decaying, (decaying)
falling from high spirits
I flee...
Throughout the ruins of me
Longing for finding my way out
Leaving myself, there's nothing left for me
The ruins are about to crumble down

The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies
It reflects hatred in my eyes

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down, I see my ashes scattered around my grave

Angels whispering fire, no longer I'm alive
Settled down, I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come

I can't get started from the part
Where I left off yesterday
Should have spent my time a little wiser

I sat alone, guilty of sin
Waiting for words to come,
From out of my head
Still making sense to anyone?

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides, it's not worth it to try

Get out
Get out

Lock myself up in a room
Without a window just to see
If it was any easier to breathe (I was wrong)
Never underestimate the daylight
The air is so much easier to breathe

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides, it's not worth it to try

the water's starting to freeze
the only one who remembers
taking the wrong step falling in front of me
this body's already aging
these nights are already long
and if I last through the winter I swear to you now, I wont call

congratulations, go home now

will we last through the winter
will we make it to see
I never wanted a partner
and I never loved you
now you are free to leave
this heart is already frozen
I can't remember to thaw
and if I last through the winter
I swear to you now, I won't call

congratulations, go home now

it's too late it's too late
they won't let go
I've followed five foot steps through that open door, open door
it's too late its too late
they won't let go
I've followed five foot steps through that open door, open door

it must be buried under the heart
that makes this place persistent
you'll find in time, the gate's been open and
I've been wondering, if you'd been real with us

it's too late...

How they come, how they go

To a cold winter field
With ground below
Hard as steel
Beyond the hill
A distant song
But that hill
Keeps going on and on

Oh God, that seems like so much work
I want to sing and dream and drink and cry
And let this night pass me by

Oh, take me to the future, I'm ready
My affection is so unsteady
I can think of tomorrow
I can sleep through today
As the sun melts the ice caps away

I'll carry your cross now, baby
It's a blasphemous world today
We are the tender missionary
From the Underworld USA

It is so easy to confess
When you are guilty of nothing less
Than a crooked wretched stupid tepid
Indifference

Yea, take me to your bedroom, I'm ready
My complexion is so unsteady
I remember tomorrow, I forget yesterday
I want to move into your body and stay

I'll carry your cross now, baby
It's a blasphemous world today
We are the tender missionary
From the Underworld USA

I'll bury your pain now, baby
Are you happier now? I feel now
In the tender cemetery
Where we always are here to stay

They said the meek shall inherit the earth
Oh, I want to know what it's all worth
With a knife in my back
And a star in my eye
Oh, let this life pass me by

Can you take me to your heaven? I'm ready
I know the weight of my heart is too heavy
I will love you with all of the love that I have
Even if that means there's none left for me

I'll carry your cross now, baby
It's a blasphemous world today
We are the tender missionary
From the Underworld USA

I'll bury your pain now, baby
Are you happier now? I feel now
In the tender cemetery
Where we always are here to stay

I did this to myself
The summer air burning in my lungs
One more glance till I come undone
Let's stop this rising sun

Bright lights can see
They always shine right through me
Leaving me an open book
Of halfways and could-have-beens
Taking us to the end, end, end
And that summer changed us
It's best I admit that to myself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world

Now it's just me sucking in that summer air
What a summer, I had no care
How quick it all crashed down
Not willing to bend, bend, bend

And these struggles changed us
It's best to admit that to yourself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world

That morning came too soon
What were we suppose to do
One choice torn in two
I know what you were put through
And I thought we had it
We didn't have enough
We can't go back
We'll never go back now
THIS IS THE END

Yet I never wonder where you went
I only wonder why, I wonder why

That is all you've ever known of life
That's all you'll ever do
There's a dream I have where I sail away
Looking back I wave at you, and I wave goodbye

The sense of insignificance
It winds itself around your chest.
Surrender and submission have now become what it takes to be alive.
Just keep in mind this happens to the best of us at times,
And it's not going to get any easier.
You walk this road of desolation,
Only to end up on your knees,
But just know that you are not alone.
The only things holding you back are the lies that you refuse to challenge.
You're drowning in a sea of self destruction,
And your lungs are starting to cave in.
And when you feel that your words can only be heard in echoes,
They are more deafening than ever before.
Every day we face helps build the strength that makes us who we are.
I've lived through this,
And so can you.
Suffering in silence has become something thrown to our past.
And though the friendships that we've built are constantly falling apart,
The remaining few retain the most heart.
And I'll give you my heart.

And the space between us growing ever greater makes it hard for me to breathe.
But no amount of distance can change my feelings for you.
How can it be that a day I've always dreamed of,
Could also be a day that I wished would never come?
And we are slowly becoming two very different people,
But I won't give you up without a fight.
This is everything I've ever meant to say to you.
You could be thousands of miles away,
But I'll still see you when I close my eyes.

And we've come too far to let what we've built fall apart.
We both know this is love. I will never forget you.

And you're grasping at your last chance for salvation,

If this is truly where I belong

The current will carry us
I am proud of all that I've become
and I'm well aware that I have steered myself in the right direction
And life is your's to destroy
I just can't respect your decision
I would rather isolate myself than be a walking definition of travesty

I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole
You were the catalyst for your downfall
But where the rest have failed

want you to watch you slip away. I want you to realize that your existence has
meant nothing. I hate you more than you could ever fucking know. And I hate
you for making me feel like this. I know deep down that I'm a good person, but
my patience is wearing thin. The best retaliation I can think of, would be to
let you know that for once in my life, I'm truly happy. I'm more than content
with who and where I am. Your oppression has had no effect. I don't need to
justify my opinion after everything we've been through. And year after year, we
give our everything and what we receive in return, I can't explain with words.
I'm so fucking thankful that I made it to where I am today. (I watched the
world upon your shoulders, and from these heights it's so far down.)

I never asked for anyone to listen, and I never asked for
anyone to take my words to heart. I've let myself become a target based on
nothing more than expression. I will not lie to others, and I won't lie to
myself. If you're searching for safety you can find it somewhere else, and I
won't mind. I've never seen myself as optimistic, so this should come as no
surprise. No one feels good forever. Not even me. But this doesn't give us an
excuse to allow ourselves to become useless like the rest. We will turn our
hatred into something to be proud of. We will make life worth living.

I'm looking back on those I once looked up to, and I can't help
but feel that I'm looking down. Everyone I've ever admired has left me with
nothing. Not even a memory. I remember growing up, and yearning to be just like
you. It pains me to admit that I held you in such a high regard, as if my life
would mean nothing without your approval. But now I see the error of my ways.
All that time spent searching for myself in someone else. I think it's safe to
say that I've become everything I wanted to be. And no one can take that from
me. All of my heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself. I can't
believe how naive I used to be when I never really needed anyone. All of my
heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself.

I've never told this to anyone.
I've just tried to move past.
But lately it seems that my insecurities have got the best of me.
And I'm no longer in control.
No one should ever have to feel like this.
To feel like me.
Even though the good I have outweighs the bad,
the bad is what's leaving me with sleepless nights.
I spend most of my time arguing with my own reflection.
For no apparent reason.
And it may seem as if I have all the answers, but I'm just as lost as you.
I've spend the past few years trying to overcome my own misery,
but these sort of things take time, and I'm running out of mine.
So I will pray to a God that isn't there, to a world that doesn't hear,
to anyone who will listen,
to keep me from becoming everything I promised myself that I would never be.
I do not deserve this.

This is the only thing I have worth holding onto
I have condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages that no one will ever see
But still I fight day after day 'cause this is all I've ever wanted my life to be
And I push everything I’ve ever loved away
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking

If I find the bad in everything,
I can never be attached
I’m trying to find a balance
I’m trying to find a way
But every choice I’ve ever made brings me anywhere but home
But I’ve welcomed sacrifice with open arms
And I will never regret my decision
This is the only thing that makes me feel alive

Makes me feel alive

I’ve simply been searching for the right place to rest my head
I’m searching for common ground between all that I am and all that you need me to be
I’ve seen a future and want nothing to do with it
A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared
I’m struggling but I won’t allow myself to sink

You know where to find me
I keep my composure and assume my place, in front of those who I love most
You’re the reason why we’re here
I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink
I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink

I want to thank you for never being there. Your absence has
forced me to find my own way. While others are led through life with a
blindfold, I can see clearly, the rain will wash me away. I reject the thought
of a god when all we see is the work of an ill-fated world. I reject a liar's
cross. Who am I to say what I believe is right for the masses? I just know it's
right for me. For this I have secured my place in hell, but every day I face is
my own heaven in the making. What do you believe in? What do you think is
right? Centuries have passed, the voice of reason is still being suppressed.
Salvation dances in front of their faces, but they're too blind to see. I
reject the thought of a God, when all we see is the work of an ill-fated world.
I reject a liar's cross. Thank you for never being there. Thank God for never
being there.

I will graciously accept that my life's work, whether it be
In the past, the present, or the future will be overshadowed by those around me
With a different definition of "success." Though I can't explain the path I've
Chosen, all I know is I'm right where I need to be. And though I've turned down
A chance at fame and fortune, I know that there is no greater payment than
This. And I'm so fucking far from the life I'm supposed to lead, and the man
I'm supposed to be and I couldn't be happier. And I will remain a constant, I
Know where I stand, and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I
Am. While I may die poor, at least my life had meaning, there's more to life
Than living, and I truly feel alive. And I know that when I die, there will be
Others who feel the same way ready to take my place. This is our song of
Protest. I promise you that nothing is slowing us down. While I may die poor,
At least my life had meaning, there's more to life than living and I truly feel
Alive. And I know that when I die, there will be others who feel the same way
Ready to take my place. I will laugh in the face of those who tell me
Different. Even with both of my feet planted firmly on the ground, I am free to
Move in my own direction. I will remain a constant. I know where I stand.

All of our lives we've been told what to believe. "Nothing
Is perfect" so what's the point of purpose? The line that separates the weak
From us who truly care, is one I don't intend to cross. The heart of man beats
But only in greedy hands, and it seems that most are still content. Where most
Are comfortable accepting insignificance, we strive to find the effort within.
If you open up your eyes, and open up your mind you will be exposed to a world as
Cold as those who are left to populate it. Two decades spent swallowing lie
After lie has sparked a fire in my heart, and the time has come to spread the
Flame. We can't continue wasting time, day after day trying to find a new means
Of escape. We do this day after day. And I can't face the disconnect. I'll shed
The dead weight and rise. I never thought that I would need to justify a reason
To continue in this life I lead. I fucking hate the world, I fucking hate
Myself. I fucking swore I'd never feel like this.

Though I look forward to my future, just know I'm scared to
death. After all is said and done, I won't have a clue what to do next. Will I
struggle to find the answer? Will I take an easy way out? Or will I find the
strength inside to carry on? My greatest fear is amounting to nothing. I
fucking hate the fact that I feel no sense of security. But more importantly, I
hate the fact that I can't confide in myself. It feels like nothing good will
stay, unless I stay the same. I need to find a way to dissolve the uncertainty.
This is who I am, and this is who I'll always be. I refuse to be afraid, of
something I don't know to be true. I need to pick myself back up, I need to
find a way to keep all the worry from head. Before it sends me to an early
grave. I refuse to let fear define me.

The weight came and went and took my will to live.
Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what's left of me.
That's when breathing became routine, and I could feel myself fading.
Stranded.
No direction, I am a compass.
Constantly spinning.
Constantly searching for the end.
Never reaching our destination.
But the goal was never when, or where, or who...; It was only you.
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there.
You promised you'd never let me go.
But I don't know what to believe anymore.
Affection allowed me to let the light in, the fear made me whole again.
Help me rebuild my broken bones.
Help me regain my sanity.
But with caution always present, our pasts manifest themselves.
And we act as if this is what we deserve.
But I refuse to fail again.
I'd force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave.
I watched the world give up on me.
I used to spend my nights praying for air in my bloodstream, now i long to feel your breath pass through my arteries.
The goal was never when, or where, or who...; It was only you.
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there.
You promised you'd never let me go.
But I don't know what to believe anymore.
Fill me with your faith and let me leave.
I'm scratching at my skin to take my mind off the absence we've created.
The lines blur together like the veins in my arms.
And I wish I wasn't so alone, You are the difference between Hell and Home.

We ache to be transparent.
We run from the "open" arms; the facade of something greater than ourselves.
And we're left to coexist with infestation.
Our history is cursed: Through the past, present and future.
If they're created in his image, then his image is disgusting...; and even he can't wipe you clean.
How can someone see so far ahead, while they're spending every day on their knees?
Is the view from above really worth the judgement passed?
The fear, the lies, and the manipulation?
A doctrine bathed in ignorance, and written in the blood of the enslaved.
And I have never lost my faith, I just never had any to begin with.
I would sooner die for my sins, then pray for my  forgiveness.
Sew my palms together, and crucify the thoughts in my mind.
Awaiting Armageddon.
Neglecting to exercise the demons in your head.
You're "born again," but you're better off dead.
Conversion or a casualty, renounce and save yourself.
Is the view from Heaven really worth all of the judgement passed?
The pestilence that you've inflicted, and the souls of all the loved one's we've lost?
We are the sheep that rose against the shepherd, we are the ones you led astray.
Embrace the light in your heart, not the one in the sky.
Saints and sinners rejoice, we will all rot together.

Everything ends, at least that's what we hope for.
Plagued by our past and we're doomed to repeat ourselves.
Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions, and circle the mind like a snare: Binding me, I'm just trying to feel something.
Cold and stale, searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted.
You wrap yourself around me, but I can only sense your presence.
You're nothing but a carcass.
I've never felt more alone than I did on those nights I spent watching you sleep.
You're the furthest thing from me, and you've been there from the start.
An empty shell, you're vacant and it scares me to death. One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris.
Fortunately, I know that I'm not worth it.
Because in my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone.
Why did I think that this time it'd be different?
I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions.
I tried by hardest but I couldn't make you feel a fucking thing.

The grave welcomes you with open arms.
Last light escapes, last breath remains.
Circling the body, brushing passed the skin and bone.
It cradles you, your holy manger.
Born into ruin, we feel withdrawal.
Death is your procreator, your predecessor.
From your decay grows a beautiful garden, The stalks caress your failure, and the petals bring you closer to eternity.
Pray for your rebirth.
Pray for your chance to bloom.
The heart starts and stops, the mind disconnects.
As flowers, we grace the earth with our presence.
The tide rises and turns, and we simply expire.

Over-saturated, our lungs fill with the essence of the universe.
Until we feel the gentle kiss of dawn draw the water from our lungs, and we can breathe easy.
Like night and day, we have never met. Aching for one another, we aim for congregation.
You are my prey, you are the martyr.
The blight takes it's toll and our bodies grow black.
Wilted, we fade away. Rotted from the root, we exchange our stem for legs.
We blossom into our bodies, and the process has been reset.
Welcome to your new home.

Born of two; raised by four.
I guess I took it all for granted, and only three remain.
Even though you're wounded, I know that you're still here.
I don't blame you, you just can't face the change.
We spend our golden years as living ghosts.
Caught in a constant state of purgatory.
We are only burdened by our memories until the day they cease to exist, and we follow shortly after.
Although I wonder if at any time, our minds fell upon the same plane.
I know they did, I just wish I had a chance to go back and appreciate it.
But we'll always have the winter, and the snow that got trapped behind the glass.
You may be only a shell of the man that you used to be, but I love you just the same, and I will until the day you're gone.
I just never know if I'm communicating with you or the disease.
And even though I curse the idea of an afterlife, I still hope you're taken care of.
You deserve to be at peace.
Please don't forget my face.
I won't forget to remember you.

As far back as I can remember, the failure was always there.
It was the only real companion that I have ever had.
Not meant to live like this.
Consciousness is nothing more than a vicious cycle, and I am being bled dry by my conviction.
I've spent my life trying to find my confidence, and found absolutely nothing.
Life is a lost cause.
Too weak to carry on.
I wish I'd never met who I once was.
Not meant to live like this.
Pursuing the love in all that I have lost, but I have left myself neglected, deserted from the start.
Longing for a chance to wander; a chance to chase my aspiration.
When you're devoid of feeling, you just do as your told.
Hatred is exhausting, but it's all I'll ever know.

I live with the awareness of my own seclusion.
Existence fuelled by separation, A war I will not win.
Embracing only alienation.
To suffer is to abandon the only home I've ever had. Outlier.
I don't belong here.
The present state of existence acts as a refuge for the weak.
To shield our eyes is to blind mankind. Refusal to secede.
Inhabiting a world of filth which others have condemned.
We won't live our lives for them. Human hatred is my second nature.
This is the root of my isolation. I am what I am, and I am an outcast.
Don't look for me in the clouds, when I am beneath you.
Nowhere to be found.
Submerged in apathy, it's just becoming hard to care, and I am nothing.
I have grown sick of the sound of my heartbeat.
And while the whole world breathes in unison.
My lungs are my shield, to reject the world around me.
I am what I am, and I am an outcast.

If I allow the light to leave my eyes, I will never see again.
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution.
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence.
Show me the meaning of happiness.
Trapped inside this nightmare, but I haven't slept for days.
I am a slave, a slave to what I cannot see.
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out?
The quest to be clairvoyant: You are your own black hole.
How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last?
Your words like rope, tied around my throat.
Remove the earth beneath me.
Watch my spirit sink.

Tragedy is all we have in common, and at times we allow it to swallow us whole.
Drawing the marrow from our misfortunes to ignite the fire that's inside, inhale the smoke from the burn that leaves you breathless.
Breathing life into the lifeless, dragging them into the sun and exposing them as apparitions.
But is there dignity in living as an entity?
"You could have made history, and we are already forgetting about you."
Humanity is poison, and we are lost without a cure.
So stop your heart and start the healing process.
I am not fit to walk among you, but I don't want to end my life.
And just know that If I knew of any common ground, I'd leave here now, and when I got there I would build a home that I could die in.
Just to say I tried to rest in peace.
Erase me from your memory.
The ones we love will let us down, and the rats will feed off of our failure.
Eventually, this is something that we must accept.
The world moves on without us.
We leave only footprints that fade away in time.
We leave our spirits to retrace our steps.
Walk with fire, and save yourself from vagrancy.
You are your memorial, find your mark and make it.
The soil is the last thing we ingest, we watch our ashes scatter.
You are your memorial, find your mark and make it.

I can only find solace in sleep, a sub-conscious sanctuary, I am longing to be set free.
Yet I am the one who holds the key.

Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my own false witness.
Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind...; and will I ever really let it come to surface?
You only see what I want you to see, and you believe all that you're told.
Serenity is a beautiful hoax.
A liar.
I have the whole world convinced of my contentment.
No truth in this.
I've lost count of all the times I made it home alive...; and wished I hadn't.
Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my phone false witness.
I'm left to conquer the mountains in my mind, and I am my maker.
Life is what's killing me.
I hate the fact that I'm just fine.
Forever seeking something to take responsibility.
Life is what's killing me.
I hate the fact that I'm alive.
Forever searching for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality.
At least I can say I tried, to cherish every single day where I woke up and didn't want to die.
I'd work my hands down to the bone trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds.
But I know I'd just be counting down the minutes until I'm miserable again.

Burnin' my defenses by the shakin of her hips,

And then she
Moves in,

Breathing down my neck,
She had me wrapped around her wrist.

I try to
Break loose,
Tight grip,
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip.

It was a

A fast fight,
She ain't taking any prisoners
And she's through playing nice.

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.

She gets me deep in the chest,
Straight through my bullet-proof vest.
She kisses like a grenade,

All kinds of scars

In the call for sanity nothing breathes.
So I'll put you up as a friend of Mary's,
'Cause when she's raring to go she's quite contrary.

In the race for courage everyone's gone blind.

You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer, killer.

Happy in a manic sort of way
But I'm real on a manic high day
'Til the universe has left us all behind

You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer, killer.

I can't let go of the past,
When it's my future that's safe and rosy,
I can't step out onto the streets,
When it's my moods that keep me broody.

Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens

Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens

The months go by
And I don't think of you
The signal is frail
An imprint of what you do

So I turn up the sound
And you are nowhere
I have learnt this
To my cost

But I maintain
In the slow lane
I maintain
In the slow lane

The scent goes by
Still I smell of you
You say I cry
At the merest thought of you

So you let me down
To laugh at nothing
I have learnt this
For myself

But I maintain

With a backwards glance I said goodbye
Saw the regret in your eyes
It's too late now to change the truth
While we're living under the same roof

It's a ruse of yours
To alter perception,
Manipulate a violent situation
For your own gain

With my tits in the air
I'm strong and proud
You'll see me laughing out loud
On a crowded street
In the summer heat
We'll all be there
So come and share

Manipulate a vital situation
To your own gain

And your own fear

In a conversation, talking of nothing
We were drinking sweet wine comforting our one and only
In our sterile business we have become jealous
Satisfied with our desolation, wrapped in our vivid dreams
Now I remember two days that mean a lot to me
I remember the two days where every hour was a day
And every minute was a lifetime and the ocean was a sea
And you dragged me into the mountains on a flimsy guarantee

The stronger the man the stronger the woman
If it ended now would you be willing?
I've given you everything
I've given you nothing

I used to think of angels but that's all gone
I used to dream of love and kisses wanting to belong
And I tear around the corners blindfolded to the world
I used to think that candyfloss was only made for girls

See how it feels for me?
Do you believe in me?

Hard-headed sense of failure in a narrow mind
I never used to think about the hurt I'd left behind
And now it falls upon me like winter snow
And I turn the same corners when there's no place left to go

The stronger the man the stronger the woman
If it ended now would you be willing?

Do you believe in me?
(This is my own private hour)

There untrue and unkind

There's no truth, it's instinct
There's no lies, that's gone too
There's no truth, it's instinct
There's no lies, that's gone too

All he says causes scandal
I've heard it said
That he's the original verbal vandal
Who steals your words,
Clears out your mind

There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way I'll get sucked in
There's no way, that's damn sure

There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure

Hopelessly reaching

There's no truth
There's no lies
There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure

There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no truth
There's no lies

Above my bed
In this ugly room
Hangs the whisper
Of the same man

You could be my father
For the love we've shown
It's just a little too late,
It's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and always will be

Take it, I don't want it,
You can have what you like
Just don't try to trick me to sleep,
Don't turn out those lights

You could be my father
For the love we've shown
It's just a little too late,
It's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and always will be

Dreams of meeting truth
Be my father
Dreams of meeting truth
For the love

I said
You could be my father
For the love that we've shown
It's just a little too late,
It's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, now I'm sick, now I'm sick

Just when you thought it was alright
Just when you thought it was alright

Won't say no...

He's got sugar on his lips
And he knows that the sickness is his
And he shows it
He just shows it

He'll give you the remedy
Without the chemical,
Show you the picture
Without the scenery

All he wants is
A blow by blow by blow account
Always searching for the real thing
Scratching the surface, getting nowhere

My place has been stolen,
Invaded by sharks
Covered in glitter
As shiny as glass

The pavement is soft and sweet
The galaxy is so elite

It won't say no
It won't say yes
It won't say no
It won't say yes

Crush me with your ice pick
I am the queen
I've come to take the sweetness
And keep you down in my cave

Keep you down in my cave...

The pavement is soft and sweet
The universe is so elite

It won't say no
It won't say yes
It won't say no
It won't say yes

It won't say no (everybody knows)
It won't say yes (I see it in your eyes)
It won't say no (everybody knows)

She's had a psychotic dream
For the last ten days
She feels as if she's sinking
In and out, in and out, in and out of phase

Che comes up for air
She thinks she's a queen
Starts telling all the choirboys
Where she's been

She dresses in black
Only for the occasion
She thinks she's a negro
But she's only caucasian

She can't tune in
She can't tune in
She can't get off that bus
She can't get off that bus
She can't grab hold
She can't grab hold
She's a mess this girl
And it's time you were told

It's like watching my own dream
This is not what it seems
So calculated
Now that's infiltrated

In the harshness of daylight
I'm frightened by sunlight
But I know those night-eyes
Will keep me from harm

She can't tune in
She can't tune in
She can't get off that bus
She can't get off that bus
She can't grab hold
She can't grab hold
She's a mess this girl
And it's time…

It never rains
But it pours
On a sleepy town
North of New York

It's an old, old score
It's a cold, cold world

How we gloat
At others' misfortune
A nation of reptiles
Given to nothing

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...

It's an old, old score
It's a cold, cold world

Tainted, you could say
But never frightened
For it is not in my nature
I was born of stronger stuff
Lies and deceit
Will never be enough
It's just cause and effect
Effect and frustration
That leads to desperation
And eventual separation

It's an old, old score

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...

It never rains

A nation of reptiles

Given to nothing

You can take my advice
But don't you think twice
About leaving me

Even though you shouldn't know
I can't help but tell you so
Easily

If my faith fails
Will life prevail?
Will life prevail?

We're signals and alibis
We're half-truth and half-lies
We're signals and alibis
We nearly laugh and nearly cry

I only want to be liked by you
I only want to be liked by you

You're the one who has it all
but don't pretend you didn't fall
frequently

So when you go I hope you know
I saw it all and let you go
lazily

Now my heart's frail
Will you prevail?
Will you prevail?

We're signals and alibis
We're half-truth and half-lies

Hits from the bong

pick it, pack it
Fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down
Just for a second
Don't get me wrong
It's not a new method
Inhale
Exhale
Just got an ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double-barrel bong
Is gettin' me stoned
I'm skill it
There's water inside don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky, phunky, smelly green shit
Sing my song
Puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong
Hits from the bong y'all

Hits from the bong
Can i get a....hit?
Hits from the bong
Can i get a....hit?

Hits from the bong

Let's smoke that bowl
Hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it
Unplug it
Don't strain
I love you Mary Jane
She never complains
When I hit Mary
With that flame
I light up the cherry
She's so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don't get me stirred up
The smoke, through the bubbling water
Is makin' it pure so I got ta
Take my hit and hold it
Just like Chong
I get the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong

I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.

Well that's the funk elastic,
The blunt I twist it,
The slammified,
Buddhafied,
Funk on your diskus.
Oh what you missed this?
You got to bear witness.
Catch a ho, and another ho,
Merry Christmas.
Yes I smoke shit,
Straight off the roach clip,
I roach it.
Fold the blunt at once,
To approach it.
Forward motion,
Make you sway like the ocean.
The herb is more
than just a powerful potion.
What's the commotion?
Yo,
I'm not joking around,
people learnin'
bout what they're smoking.
My oven's on high when I roast the quayle.
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale.
Exhale.
Now you the phunk of the Thai'
When I feel the effects

I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.

My shit's fat like a sumo slammin' that ass
Leavin' your face in the grass

Or kick that style: wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile

These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground
To the next town
They get mad
When they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate pilot
Of this ship if I get
Wit' the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen
Look, but don't make your eyes strain

I'mma do my thing, let me tell you right now
Cuz I don't know any other way of livin' my life now
Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble
Some of you hustle and some of you just lookin' for trouble
(some of you just lookin' for trouble!)
I don't follow or lead, tomorrow's a dream
Pray to God to intervine on all the sorrow I've seen (U Know I mean?)
You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna
Nothin' can stop you if that's your type of persona (Persona!)
Life is short enough don't make me say it 10 times (10Times!)
I'll kick over for mine even in the end times (Times)
I can beat the system, come on, let's say it with me
Show me some optimism, we can take over the city (We can take over the city!)

Real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway

There comes a time in your life, you gotta go for yours
Stay invaders like the battle of forever more
I stay pedal to the metal foot on the floor
I'mma keep on the streets, knockin' down your doors
I'm by the dollar, like everybody oughtta be
Don't burn nobody and make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway just by the  economy
See I ain't coughin' unless it makes a profit
I'm droppin' it so hot, chick, like everyday gossip
Regardless of the climate, I'm gonna get it every day
Even if the bullets spray, I'm gonna get it anyway

This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way

So let 'em hear the cellar by,  the collar
Makin' it harder for you to wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little to make your pain numb
Tippin' that bottle got you forgettin' where you came from (Forgettin' where you came from!)
But I'm the same one, where you think my name's from?
I'mma keep it movin' and never stop till the game's done (Never stop till the game's done!)
Forever we live it, forever we spit it, remember the minute
You witnessed the realest that ever did it (Quit it!)
Still I'm committed, no matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick, I'm puttin' on a clinic (I'm puttin' on a clinic!)
We a troubled times, swervin' through the double lines
You're in a head on collision 'cause now you servin' time (Now you servin' time!)

This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day

Hey man! Check this out. I got the best KUSH ever man
Aw, man... I've been so out... You got sent from heaven
All right, man, light it up, holmes
Ok, check it out man

I'm the original Dr. Greenthumb the rest are liars
I'm the one with the prescription to get you higher
I got every type of weed that you might desire
Go ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired
Any kind of flavor you savor
I can do you the favor
Just as long as you share with your neighbor
Some like the Sour D, that's an east coast swing
But on the west coast we all know KUSH is queen
Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
No stress, no bush, I'm pushing the KUSH
When I harvest put a K on the bag like the Nike Swoosh
I'm over the world, in case you wonder
I smoked everywhere I went, they call me the weed hunter
But no one does it better like we do in Cali
Just ask one of my patients cause they always tell me that the...

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

Kottonmouth Kings are down with us
Snoop Dogg and Dre are down with us
Cheech and Chong, they're down with us
But the DEA, they can get the nuts
On a high times cover, you might see us
Taking hits from the bong with the eight-foot Zong
With weed so strong, that knockout King Kong
Hit it one good time... Your mind's gone
Your eyes get red, and your mouth goes dry
Just get me when you want more and I'll supply
Red and meth said, "let's gets stoned" I said "How High"
They said "high enough to touch God and kiss the sky"
"That's a tall order But I think I got what you need"
I got the food for though and I'm ready to feed
So, follow my lead I got some gifts to bring
It's an everyday life for the Reefer King

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

I got the cream of the crop
My crop means cream
When it's time to bag it up I assemble the team
We're like the Yankees, most winning, grand champs of the herb
Nothing gets you like the type of medicine I serve
Lawyers, teachers, actors, street cleaners
No matter what they are, they all come to see the Reefer
They stay high 24 like Keifer
I tell 'em don't hit too hard, this is a Creepa
Woody Harrelson is down with us
Bruce Willis smokes all, he's down with us
Yeah, Willie Nelson is down with us
Who the fuck you think drives the ganja bus?
Dionne Warwick, she's down with us
She got caught at the airport with joints and such
So if anyone asks, she's down with us
And you don't wanna enter more weed in the Cannabis cup
I'm Greenthumb, I reign supreme, son
A strain better than mine, I've never seen one
The K.U.S.H. keeps you so high that you can't concentrate
Dave Chapelle, is down with us
Halle Barry, too, but don't tell no one
KRS-One is down with us
He's a blunt getting smoked and he can't wake up

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, (?) try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'Cos I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside

You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"

Ain't no-body better, on that you can bet (CY-PRESS!)
Wanna see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees and real DJs
Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big sucess
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion
No I ain't jokin, see my mic smokin'?
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

I lost my innocence at birth but I make no excuses
for the trivial things and the pain life induces
Bitches are wild, and so was I, young and stupid
it's incredible, what a shitty circumstance produces them
Criminals, led by the originals, high strung, motivated by the, principles
some of us out - he used to think we were invincible
on the corner bangin' and slangin' the high bitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand...

So many, come and go in this lifetime that you serve
Faces change, liscenses' everywhere you turn
Gangsta's become blinded, visions become blurred
Learned to stay alive to the real side of the curb
You came along way but some still refuse to notice
they turned they back on us and they tried to provoke us
You ask about us, you talk trash about us
walk fast around us, but my block fast allowed us
Don't try to crowd us nigga, we'll smack you up
Look around and see who's willin' to back you up
You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter
Cause I know what these son-of-a-bitches are after
Your mind and soul, if your blind and cold
then your true sign is shown, then your fuckin' mind is blown

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but we're still standin' strong

You spit my name and use it like an obscenity
You got more skulls in your closet than a Kennedy
You on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
I can tell you what's crackin' and done get splitten
You corrosin' on the floor, shaken and snake bitten
You in a cold sweat like James of the names you knew
Don't mean shit to me and you ain't got a clue
of what's about to happen - interaction
Two worlds collide - one survives the reaction
Hold tight, keep yourself together
cause we're about to storm you like shitty weather

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: "You ain't shit to me"
Without you takin' it personally

I don't wanna be the King of the Sing
Just a Soul Assassin for the Cypress Team
I rhyme and sing and make bitches scream
They love that old South Side gangsta lean
Call the Psycobeta, I guess you're crackin'
Turn into Mad Dog when I start rappin'
Look at hostile - ah, damn wild
Shake you up in a hurry from the voodoo child
Don't get caught up hangin' on the mortar
Hold on and I'll turn y'all punks all wild

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: "You ain't shit to me"
Without you takin' it personally

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, come on!

I'm tired of whack rappers and fame seekers
Like you know the deal to be in my same sneakers
I don't mind exposin' you hollow bitches
I got the medicine over the swallow bitches
You play roles like an actor but get no oscar
Gun spray, gunned away, cut from the roster
You're just an imposter, you lost your composure
Respect your exposure to bring you to your closure
But you're in denial and still remain vile
In a place within last style and senseless wild
I take you down the long trail you failed to keep up
That's when you get introduced to the street sweeper

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself UP FOR CATASTROPHE!!!

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: "You ain't shit to me"
WITHOUT YOU TAKIN' IT PERSONALLY...

I remember times I hustle, times I struggle
Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
People tryin' to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cos it's a Chronicle
My life, I realise I'm responsible for obstacles
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all commited to stay
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on
'Cos you'll keep goin' crazy 'til your mind is gone

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

I been around for many days, of musical mainstays
Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
The Original Pyscho-Baiter
Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later
Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more
Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect
Now, what's (?) all with this year 2000's?
We puttin the Smackdown and we ain't clownin'
Not many have lasted
Since we first blasted
Up on the scene, singin' about the dream
Recruitin' for our team, niggas know what I mean
?Damn?, you defy, when you live or die

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

Times I hated, times I waited
Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?
Still hatin', creatin' all the evil now
Your insecurties are showin', exposin' you
You're trippin' on me and showin' emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me

I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage (barking)
Not that many can deal with the fury
Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
I kill and observe and go in an instant
I bring the pain like the ?Rampark? Prison
I kept it right for the brother to the ?Chullo?
Something I bump when your gates in the (?)

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
It Ain't Easy, yo, It Ain't Easy

You know what time it is

Whoop

Legalize it,

Legalize it, (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

Why, Why, Why (Bo Bo Bo Bo)
Cypress is still here
We're of those glad MCees
Still Puffin Weed, Weed
Why Diddely Why
Why, Why, Why

Never fucked like this
But I smoke blunts like this
People ask: Why you pull stunts like this?
Cuz I believe in doing what I got' a
A lot' a people don't understand nada
The Mic burns
You was at
It turn's to a slaughter
You wanna think about chilling the fuck out,
You all gonna Top Allah, Pop collar,
Niggas, Latin Thungs
All my family love barillas
Beginners get pushed to back of the pack
Invented and lend out, without not a tech
You're on the top of the game
But you work on a name till one day
To put us in the walk of fame
Don't call a name to recall the fame
Eventually Dru is in the Hall of Fame
You know what the deal is,
You know what the heal is,
You know who the Real is,
You know what my skill is,

Once Upon,

I get mental
This ain't no pad and a pencil
chrome microphone,
My only utincel
Attack the track, like I got nothing to lose (That's right)
I test myself, just to shut up and proove
That the C-Y-P-R-E-S-S
Got you funky, while I'm real deaf
Put it to the test, and you will confess
Soul Assassins is the best
Check it homeboy, got to spot cracking (crackin)
Six LP, from that Thugged-out Latin
Turn the heat up, and keep it hot
Always give ya mo', and then thank
We got to freak the Hip Hop and the hot ride
I'm on to make shows and can't hide
Had first 'self titled', became an Idol
*Spanish* in a Sub town barrio

Once Upon,

Aww, comin through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby
Got that junk, for yo' trunk, goin gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playin games in the street
We got that low-ri-der, scrapin dippin on three (low-ri-der)
So pop your collar, give a holla, throw yo' dubs in the air
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin freaky tonight

Now when people are done, bumpin they head to this
You wonder why you wanted anything instead of this
We been makin you bounce, for many years already
Rock steady and cut, many niggaz to confetti
But I just want to blaze it up; whether it's the mic or a spliff
Yes my gift is to amaze you all
Thought I couldn't come for ten my friend, but guess what?
I slay niggaz and still savin my best nut (low-ri-der)
But you better cover your eyes, cause you never know when
I spit it out and start some flowin
I drop rhymes that grow like trees you're smokin
Ear drums feel like lungs, your brain's chokin
Just let it soak in, seep in, creep in
I'm keepin, all you motherfuckers in the deep end (low-ri-der)
You wanna trip? Then I got luggage
I stuff you in and send you off, cause you ain't rugged

Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin freaky tonight

Cause, we're Cypress Hill, come on and ride with us
Just get inside, we bouncin dippin, chop it up real tough
Lean to the side, pimp yo' hat, tilt yo' seat on back
Don't front on me, baby boy, and break bread with the sack (low-ri-der)

I be the vato with the fine hoodrat in the ranfla
Always roll deep on the streets like the mafia
Pleito, just might come back and haunt ya
Flossin too much, no vato's gonna want ya
Not right here homes, we're past all of that
Makin that feria, spittin that raps
Ya me conoces, I'm down for my calle
Cypress Ave, y a pudo les madre (low-ri-der)
Ya tu sabes, we don't play that shit
Any pendejo's gettin hit up quick
Whassup ese? What hood you claim?
Now throw it up and down like it ain't no thang (low-ri-der)
Hands in the air with the pinky rings
Soul Assassins, runnin everything
To all you vatos, make sure you check this
In every barrio, I'm well respected (low-ri-der)

As I sit in my silver stack thinking about way back
Even before I started blazing the chronic sack
I was a go wild unfocused troublesome kid
Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
I was at unimpressionable age through a faze
An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
Hanging over my head being wicked and loud
And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
They come at me from all angles and dangles
Memories in front of me, but I wont run away
I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
But I don't want to get locked away cause I whack bitches
I left those ways back in the old days
So go away I don't got no time to throw away

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I got my education on the streets
And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
To say whatever I went through or going through
Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you
Learn how some of these record companies be holdin you
Attaching an image in the end controllin you
But we set out to set ourselves apart
And let these people know just what they had from the start
It's like Ghostface said we studied our art form
We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
People slept on me and doubted my skill level
But I'm tenacious and I got a strong will level
You been introduced to some of the real rebels
Injected with venom from god to kill devils

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I remember my days as youth
Teenage gangsters with somethin to prove
See man amuse and we creep and we strew
Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
Just -- having fun but you crazy kids
Never thought about no prison beds
Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
Never see the kids all fucking wild
But that's the game and shit don't change
Get respect for smoking brains
You get a name and you build your rep
You courting fools coming in your set
Before you know we're having fun
Slamming doping and packing gun
Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so we can survive)

These niggas shoot first they they askin (?) names

It's all real, I bet fame, it's a chess game
Wrong move and it's checkmate (That's right)
I might sound funny out here
But really, niggas get money out here
And hey, everyday is sunny out here
So listen, don't play dummy out here

We get, hot on the heel, rely on the steel
When your paper gets pulled and you design is steeled
Like you, signed the deal, or signed over your will
(Sen Dog) BUSTERS GET SLAYED...!

...when you fuck around with Real
Take time to feel, what I'm tellin' you hoes (Tellin' you hoes)
You couldn't fuck around with me if I was sellin' you blows
Just goes to show the incredible skill tell
Bitch nigga, now you trapped under my wig well
Gettin trampled, DUMPED on and thumped on
Scraped on the six-five with the HAND ON THE PUMP SONG

Don't even fuck with these Southland grandes

It's been a while now
Been around the block many miles
Many faces, many places
that I found friends
Places where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I can call home
Places I can get stoned
I just wanna be alone
When I'm feelin' in my zone
People want to knock me down
'cos they never have their own
They won't get the best of me
But they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me?
I'm not, what you s'posed to be?
You could not give a DAMN
Coulda just Killed A Man
Sawn off in my hand
But I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my piece of mind
Feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, Trouble always found me,
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide,
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come INSIDE!

No trouble's at my door!
You want trouble, c'mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

Trouble on the line, all the fuckin' time
Got me contemplatin' the solution, the fusion my wicked mind
Got suckers that hate me but it don't really matter
I'm like a gat when I bust, niggas run and scatter
Movin' in circles, throwin' elbows and fists
You got to be a real nigga in a Cypress Hill pit
Lotta critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn
I try to put it to you BLUNTLY so you bitches can learn
That no-body get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there a lot of you have been fooled
In to actually believin' that some shit is cool
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit from somebody else
I'm down for myself, I back up myself
Put in all on the line make sure that I'M FELT!

No trouble's at my door!
You want trouble, c'mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

Nooooo!

Look, the wall's closin' in
and my shoe's wearin' thin
Had to be the biggest clown that you couldn't comprehend
Some hated on my game, said I wouldn't be the same
Called me "Rock Superstar", "Insane In The Brain"
But I know I haven't changed
So I brush you to the side
Trouble's knockin' on the door, Anxious jus' to come inside
'times I gotta block it out, no-one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin' and I can't seem to lock it out
Got my hands on the phone, I don't wanna have to talk
If you're feelin funky son, then I guess you gotta jump
I can see it in your eyes, you don't seem to recognise
I wouldn't fall into your trap, for many lives to compromise
I'm not fallin' for your shit, you ain't gonna take me there
You can talk all you want, but I don't got your weight to bear

No, trouble's at my door!
(You want trouble right now? C'mon
You want trouble right now? C'mon)

You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

Like the legend of the phoenix, huh
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planets spinning, uh huh
The force from the beginning, huh, look

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?

Go!

Seems like only yesterday the dream became so clear.
All was possible and God, it felt so near!
So I suffered and I bled, I truly did believe.
Years have come and gone, but just where has it brought me?

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Strobing snapshots of my past become a blurring flash
Just one thing can make it all come flooding back

If I'd stopped just once to look back maybe I would see
Just how far I've come, but it took it's toll on me

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Blink of an eye!
Blink of an eye!
Blink of an eye!

That's just how fast your life can change.
In the blink of an eye, everything's erased.

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Yea!

I never saw whatever it was
That came and hit me from behind.
Then I awoke enraged and confused,
How could I have been so blind?

Life's escaping, don't pretend,
Judgement comes, but who knows when.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!
Blunt force trauma to the head!

Blazing through life at the speed of sound.
Don't stop to look at the signs.
Suddenly everything crashes around you.
When we forget, life reminds.

Clock is running, falling sand,
Time is slipping through your hands.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!

It's too late!
It's too late!
It's too late!
Too late!

Blunt force trauma.
Blunt force trauma.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!

It's too late!
It's too late!

Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?

Can you feel it building?
Devastation is on the way.
Feel the hair on the back of your neck
As the rush begins.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel,
Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel,
Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel?

Can you feel it slipping
As you lose your grip on me?
Can you face that I won in the end?
I can't keep from laughing.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.

Don't you see it coming?
When you've caught on, it's too late.
When it hits, don't forget who I am,
Don't forget this face.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.

Breathing new life.

Cold blooded,
Ice in my veins.

Cold blooded,
Ice in my veins.
Ice in my veins.

Spit in your face, another worthless liar.
I know your kind.
Save me the smile, you're just a cut-throat bastard.
I read your mind.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.
What can you do after you've killed it slowly?
Where can you go after you bled it dry?

For now I'll let you believe,
I let you get to me.
Aren't you in for a shock,
You stupid motherfucker?

You'll get what you deserve,
A victim of your own game.
You're already dead to me,
Your turn to get played.

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Having control - the only validation
You constantly need.
Power to you becomes intoxication
On which you feed.

Spewing your lies and your manipulation,
Playing with lives to you is just a game.
Being around you makes me fear that you might
Get on my skin and then contaminate.

For now I'll let you believe,
I let you get to me.

(You don't even see it coming, do you?)

You'll get what you deserve,
A victim of your own game.
You're already dead to me,
Your turn to get played.

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Your face just serves to remind
Everything that I don't want to be.
Guess my mind was made up long ago,
You won't get one thing more from me!

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.

Forced my strength out of determination,
I've survived this long on will.
Dropped so many times that I've lost count.
Never stopped me once, never known anything else.

Anything else.

Try and break me down, I'll
Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't

Suffer, sacrifice, or walk away.
Make your play and risk it all.
New found power pumping through my veins,
Based on brotherhood,
Once it starts it can't be stopped.
(can't be stopped)

Try and break me down, I'll
Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't

Pick my teeth back up and crawl.

Sometimes it seemed like it just wasn't meant to be
Anger and sorrow were all that I would ever feel
Sometimes I'd dream the man that had it all was me,
Then I'd awake each time to cold reality.

But I can't wait for things to change.
Complacency is not my way.
Self-absorbed, I had lost my faith, I was
Breaking down from your apathy, now it
Feeds my hatred for all you stand for and
I can't live like this one minute more, so
Just how much blood do you have to swallow?
Before you can lead, you must refuse to follow
Now I bite the hand that starves me
Don't look so surprised it's you that created me

Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't.

Pick my teeth back up and

Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't.

Crawl
Crawl

Explode!

I feel you stare, watch me not care.
Glare at the freak, you've no control,
Feel your eyes probing me, judging me
Only makes me want to

Explode, just explode!

You don't know me but you fear me.
Tainted with ink, riddled with holes,
Staring and pointing, stupidity
Only makes me want to

Explode, just explode!
Explode, just explode!

All that's you see, scars that's made me.
See in your eyes, all you despise,
Judge me by what you see, leave me be,
Get away I'm going to

Explode, just explode!
Explode, just explode!

Fear what you don't understand.
It will always be.
Fear what you don't understand.
As it always was.

Fear what you don't understand.
It will always be.
Fear what you don't understand
I just want to

Fuck you, I'm through.
I want nothing more from you.
My sanity is wearing thin.

Irate, I hate.
You determined your own fate
Now everything is caving in

Fuck your power trip and
Fuck your attitude and
Fuck your bloated ego, too.
Fuck your history, your tragedy, your misery
But most of all, fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Fuck this, all of this
Bitch and moan and bleed and piss
Seconds away from goin' down

Go ahead and push me
Your fakery, your butchery
Is nothing compared to my hate for you

Fuck your apathy and
Fuck your empathy and
Fuck your nihilism, too
Fuck your bitter pills, take em all, you
Never will
But most of all, fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

You consulate, just a touch
Let myself be considered for themselves
Let's sit up
Hear that sound
It's not time to hang out

The summer eclipse doesn't exist
Don't watch it and hate the world

You're the one that slipped

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

There were times when I questioned my reasons.
Thought I wouldn't last.
Seemed the hand of God held my head underwater.
Somehow I fought back.

It's still not over yet.
No, it won't let me quit.

Found myself more than just once
Praying down on my knees.
My search for answers only led to more questions.
Sometimes for faith you've got to bleed.

By now I've bled my share,
Now it's my turn to redeem.

When it comes my way I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

Give all you have because you believe,
Sell your mortal soul.
And if you're not a predator, then, oh - you better pray.
Bet it all now or fold.

But there's still a danger there.
Don't become one of them.

When it comes my way I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

For all I've done - some good some bad,
Don't hang me just yet!
Judge me not on one thing I've done,
See my whole life instead!

When it comes my way, I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

Why have we waited so long,
Suppressing the power inside?
Tear away all that was wrong,
Something too massive to hide.

It's time to rip the chain from your neck,
Let go the past as you purge.
Free now from everything weighing you down,
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Cleansing yourself of the past,
Learn from mistakes and move on.
Conquering new ground at last,
Unite and become twice as strong.

It's time to rip the chain from your neck,
Let go the past as you purge.
Free now from everything weighing you down,
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Hope was all that kept me sane.
Rise above and prove myself.
I'll survive without your help.
Shut you out, my strength comes from within.

New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Power!
Power!

I'm sickened.
I know I've been betrayed,
But I keep ignoring
The warning signs.

You tell me
That I'm not beneath you,
But you act above me.
Knives in my spine.

Now with all the money in the world
You can't buy my respect.
Yeah, it's just a matter of pride
But that's all I've got left.

I reach up
For your hand as you stand
Looking down on me, but
You turn your back.

I believed you.
Now everything
That we had that I thought was sacred
Has turned to black.

Now with all the money in the world
You can't buy my respect.
Yeah, it's just a matter of pride
But that's all I've got left.

Right!

Identity murdered, malicious intent.
I'm recreating myself at last.
Rise up from destruction, start over again,
Reborn, I'm now erasing the past.

Did you think for a second I
Wouldn't bother to question why
You always put me last?
Can you look straight into my eyes
As you're excreting all your lies?
Your time is coming fast!

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!
I'm reborn.

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!
I'm reborn.

Everything now that would stand in my way
Is doomed to take the impact to come.
You think you can stop me, you'd best think again.
You want a piece of me? Come get some!

So everything that you've throwing at me
Has only helped me make up my mind.
And all you do will amount to nothing.
You can't effect me, don't even try.

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!
I'm reborn.

I'm reborn.

"Save me from myself", I call out,
But no one hears my plea.
Burn my candle fast from both ends.
Nightmares grow from dreams.

You don't know, you can't see thrugh my eyes,
So you don't know me!
You don't know what's going through my mind,
But can you help me?

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Intensity that grows within me,
Reflections of my pain.
I'll create or I'll destroy,
But either way it's always in my veins.

You don't know, you can't see through my eyes,
So you don't know me!
You don't know what's going through my mind,

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Now that I'm all alone
Painfully aware
I'm starting to feel the cold
Knowing you're not there

Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company

Come and look inside, hope you like what you see
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed

Throwing a shadow on
Every thought I have
Knowing that something's gone
Echoes in my head (echoes in my head)

Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company

Come and look inside, hope you like what you see (denying what you see)
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me (scared of what is me)
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me (they claw, yeah)
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed (the soul is left to bleed)

Wake up!

Our lives are entwined, can't escape
But you and I have never stood face-to-face
Still I can't get away
Think that you can just step right in/
Push me out and then fuck things all up again?
It never seems to end.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Wake up!
Wake up!

Cling to skeletons, fearing change,
Paralyzed thinking what the future will bring.
You're killing everything.

Pure adrenaline, I tear in
Hatred is my fuel
Truth dissects you again
And you've run out of friends

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

And now it's time, the countdown begins.
Extracting the truth, what was from what is.
And once and for all we lay it to rest
And never look back again.

Never again!
Never again!
Never again!
Never again!

I can't believe all the things done to me.
Sight unseen.
You don't know one fucking thing but you
Judge me.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.

This is the breakedown.
ha!
try to follow.


inside I'm crying, dying to ask why
We're working for nothng from 9 to 5
I can feel the exhaustion wearing on me
can't face the fact that -
I am not free

freedom is a lie we learned to believe
like a book with no pages we pretend to read
you envy me - let me tell you where I came from
I ran like hell through my imaganation
just to get away from what i did not understand
like how a boy becomes a coward and calls himself a men
and everyone around him pats him on the back
happily obvious ignoring all the facts
knick knack paddi whack give a dog a bone
sit, stay, roll over, run away from home
this is what we teach to the demons we create
avoid your inner conscience,
and hide from your mistakes
then lie awake hunted by your messed up thoughts
contemplating actions afraid of getting caught

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

I wonder why we're still falling for the same old tricks
it seems like we're  all broken and need to be fixed
were like robots aboarding the economy that failing anyway
and won't let us be who we wanna be
its sickening a world on the go
I need a triple tall hot latte and a blueberry scone
and for lunch, I'll take number 5
with a large diet coke
and an extra side of fries
and you can feed me lies
I'll eat them up to
at night I pray to god and ask him what to do

this is how wer'e wating on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on te edge

and millions of children, dying of hunger
we cant see the lightning, cant hear the thunder
we are going under
if things don't change soon
the world will be dead by tomorrow at noon
raped of her glory
raped of her life
raped like the husbands rape their wives
and the wives have also lost their minds
drowning their kids
and feeding them lies..

all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I
all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I, aye

I don't wanna sit and wait for shit to hit the fan
but you can, if you want
with the family you brought
to the land of all promises
where all you ever wanted was a chance to take a stand
against the world that took your confidence
because you have been on it since
the day you turned ten
and your dad said you have to earn your money to spend
thats what you did - you became part of the system
working to earn a respect of old rich men.
shining their shoes, and pressing their pants
playing their games and dancing their dance
basically home to get a chance -
a chance to get notice, to maybe advance
but, let me let you in on a little secret -
you can package your pride, and tell theme to keep it
because you dont need them. they need you caus' you feed them
you do the work while they sit tall cause you are lucky you have a job at all
right?

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

so one more time everybody, alright.

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

Album  Rise From The Dead
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie

It twists and turns
Into something that is not to be
What truth is left
What's abandoned as the life flew by
Our words are broken

We commit to our sacrifice
The betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie
Our words are broken

Our subconscious bias
Confirms what we already believe
There is no message, there is no value
Just the sheltering of false ideas

Tear our thoughts
Into splinters
Set the sense
That's forced to remember
Words get thrown
Out of focus as we
Test our will
Dissolve to nothing
Break all bounds
Of unfair holding
Track this line
To journey's end
We're breaking down

Name  For Broken Words
Artist  Dark Tranquillity
Album  Construct
It all comes out
In desire we forgot to face
Take down ambition
Or in our minds we will always fail

The faceless remember
The Hours and the fallen words
Connect the fallacies
Detect autonomy
There is a limit
To the never ending sky

We must come to terms
Admit we are defeated
We must come to terms
With bias and deception
Stand up and be counted
In uniformity

It sets a high mark
For what our minds can endure

Is there life in the distance
A faint beacon of light
Let us fall to the inner ceiling
Of everything we see

The endless resistance
Decides upon the fallen words
Direct the agony to a non-response
And forgiveness to an idealized mirage

It informs all decisions
And challanges us to dare

All has now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high
If there was something out there
I've learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care

Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

As always in these matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons
Never to share again

This is how it all begins

Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

This is how it all begins

Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

This is a ghost town, alive with the echoes of failures fled
Lit up by shining faces that parade these streets
What used to be of humility is gone
You walk the mounds of skull and bones
Where living is denied, I see more movement in decomposition than in those hollow eyes

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

Set flame to the ensnarers and pierce that ornate shield
Branded by what claims you, you wear the mark of death
Tear from loss and agony, a character defined
Stripped of all but tragedy, what life is left to find?
Go now, until there's nothing left
Go now, the dying has begun

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

So I flee from all that is me to hide behind this pale dead face
Whatever happened to desire, want and need?
Whatever happened to integrity?
Imagination is a curse in all of this
Whatever happened to the ones left behind?

This is a ghost town, our bodies dragged through endless streets
Go now, to never return
I've seen more pitiful humiliation than you could never hide

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

Why do I see her through never-ending nights?
Why do I see her wearing nothing but the dark?

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I know where you live, I can see it through your darkness
And when you sleep, I hear the heart that beats you

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I fought into the distance, a life that does not connect
Time played out its part on the strings that bind us

Encounters in silence, words elude the fading night
Wish I could fathom what is too hard to tell

Her head hangs low in the silence of the room
Her head hangs low, she takes a bite out of her heart

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

Out of your life and into your mind
Dividing lines
Someone forgotten, something inside
somewhere in time

this lasting sight
never more than a sound
so vile and infectious
a lucid recount

And I'll never say
What you want me to say
When I tell you everything's going to fade
And I'll never be
What you want me to be
When I'm in the misery that we've made

The misery that we've made!

And when will I know?
And when will you tell me
What we already know?
This is all temporary

I. I was in doubt
ever you were around
Denial and acceptance with or without

And I'll never say
What you want me to say
When I tell you everything's
going to fade
And I'll never be
What you want me to be
When I'm in the misery
that we've made

When I'm in the misery!

And I'll never say
What you want me to say
When I tell you everything's going to fade
And I'll never be

And I'll never be what you

I left my head at home,
Buried in the backyard with the dog.
I've thought of leaving more times than once.
I'm leaving you all alone.
I tried so hard to be the rock,
But all I felt like was a wet sponge.

I want to run, I just can't.
The things it takes to be a man
I'm on a road
I'm not proud of the things I have done
Don't let my living bring you down
You'll never know how much it hurts
To nod when I'm the son
I'll never stand and watch you drown

I'm under a spell.
This isn't what I want for us.
We've held it all together this long.
My spines deep as well.
My heart is bigger than you know.
This family is just a sad song
I want to run, I just can't.
The things it takes to be a man.

I'm on a road.
I'm not proud of the things I have done.
Don't let my living bring you down.
You'll never know how much it
Hurts to nod when I'm the son
I'll never stand and watch you drown

There are no words you could choose
That could change the way I feel and make me wanna stay
And I know how you look in my eyes
That there's something on your mind that you're not gonna say

Ooh, you feel me slippin' out
Nothin' to talk about
So why are you still holding on?

Ooh, it's nothing that you said
The voices in my head
Are clearer than your foolish reasons

You wouldn't have it any other way
You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no (I'm tired, so tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no

You wouldn't have it any other way (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no

You are the one I would choose
But a haunted heart wants what a haunted heart wants
And you know how you look in my eyes
But there's nothing more now that I could even say to you

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya
I should have left it now it's over
But here we are again

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya (I'm tired, so tired)
No need to question my composure (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)
Don't wanna do it again

You wouldn't have it any other way (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)

You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no (I'm tired, so tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way (I don't want to do it again)
You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya (I'm tired, so tired)
No need to question my composure (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)
Don't wanna do it again

You act stoic like a soldier

You only saw the dark side of me
Bring me back to my reality
I have lost my belief

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way
Imagine a place for us, where you and I stay

I have lost the will to fly
With broken wings I can't even try
I have lost my belief

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way
Imagine a place for us, where you and I stay

Picture a world for us
A promise to set me free
Imagine a place for us
A promise will set me free

Oh

My life was brought into a nightmare
Dark shadows surrounded me
Five times the pain of torture
It buried deep within me
It makes me shiver down my spine
To even think of it
Talk to me
What is the reason?
I'm finished
Answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

I'm going insane it feels like I am lost
The panic, the fear, the mind tricks is haunting me
Is this my destiny?
Talk to me
What is the reason?
I'm finished
Answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

Leaving our tears behind
Angels of clarity
Show me the way
Leaving my past behind

Show me the way
Angels of clarity

Save me from myself

Here is no one left to trust
Raise a light, one that I can see
Now reverse this enormous pain for this life to remain
I am walking through, watching what's left

Hold me close

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being erased

I crawl my way through every day
Raise your light, one that glows for me
Give me a sign, light my path, take me higher
I am walking through fire
Standing alone, abandoned to fate

Walk me through

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being, being erased

Being erased

Is this all that is left for me?

Hold me close

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black

I'm fading to gray, losing all track of time
I died in your own storm
I'm shattered in pieces
Lift up my eyes, I am falling too far

I open my heart for you

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

I'm fading away, I lose in the end (I lose in the end)
A reason to be, find me a miracle
Free my life from destruction
What am I worth now?
My happy ending long gone

I open my heart for you

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

(I never felt so alone) There's no turning back
(Forgiveness is long gone) I'm falling behind
(I never felt so closed) The legions are winning
(I'm falling behind) I'm losing my worth now
(I'm falling behind) My life becomes lifeless

Standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

So cold, so alone

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through

All the nights I've prayed, must this all be untrue?
I am not prepared to be strong
I just can't believe I am losing you

I can't be strong, life is disconnecting me
Now, loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days you were there protecting me

Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer

So it seems tat I've found my escape out from your prison
I am once again myself, stronger than ever
Feeling so free, feeling secure
Nothing can get me now, nothing at all
Feeling alive, it took me longer than I ever expected

'Cause of you, I'm lyin' awake at night
All I'm seeing are pictures of you
As I close my eyes
I fade my way into the laws of my dream world

It's a place of trust, will you meet me there?
There's no time to spare; come on, show me you care

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see?
Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

'Cause of you, my tries do not think of you
They just end up in one million thoughts
It's way too much to mention
See what I mean when you see my creation

It's a place of trust, I can meet you there
There's no time to spare; come on, show me you care
What you believe, it will here become real

What can I do?

This time I believed in you, in me
And I gave it all
This time I could see it all perfectly
I guess I was wrong

(I guess I was wrong)

What can I say, what can I do?
This is who I am and I'm hurting you
What can I say, what can I do?
No matter how strong my feelings are
I always end up hurting you
I always end up hurting you

Without you I am crying
With you I am just hurting you
Without you I am dying
With you I am tearing your heart

Without you I am crying
Without you I am dying

What can I say, what can I do?
This is who I am and I'm hurting you

No matter how strong my feelings are
I always end up hurting you

I picture you now right in front of me
Your beautiful eyes looking right at me
Remember the warmth you used to give me
I wish I could bring it back, wish I could take it back

Never thought it existed, never thought it could be
The second I saw you, something changed in me
My feelings flowered up, they came naturally
Something changed in me

Can you hear me calling? (Calling for you?)
Can you hear me screaming? (Screaming for you?)
It is like I'm naked out in the rain
Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling, calling, calling?

Remember the days we spent together, hey
Would give anything to have them forever
And all the things we used to laugh at
I wish I could bring it back, wish I could take it back, yeah

Now I know things that I never knew
I'm standing out here and I'm calling you
You mean the world to me and believe that it's true
I love you

Can you hear me calling? (Calling for you?)
Can you hear me screaming? (Screaming for you?)
It is like I'm naked out in the rain
Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling, calling, calling, yeah?
Screaming, yeah

Calling, you mean the world to me
You mean the world to me
Screaming, you mean the world to me
You mean the world to me

Can you hear me calling? (Calling for you?)

There are things that I need to say
To hear me, please don't take this the wrong way, hey
I don't wanna make things harder, no, I don't wanna complicate
This is keeping me awake

(Yeah) Standing at the crossroads now and we can't back down
'Cause there's nothing left worth saving there (Yeah)
We need to close that door, we've been here before
Now there's nothing left worth saving there

I hear you, maybe we're not indestructible
I know that we can be more if we let it go
I know that we can be so much better, girl
If we make the right choice now
We don't need to look back

(Yeah) Standing at the crossroads now and we can't back down
'Cause there's nothing left worth saving there (Yeah)
We need to close that door, we've been here before
Now there's nothing left worth saving there

'Cause you're breaking me, shaking me
You're taking me over
We were love drunk and we shine
We need to get sober
Before we fall over

Standing at the crossroads now and we can't back down
'Cause there's nothing left worth saving there

Standing at the crossroads now and we can't back down

It's a new day (New day, new day)
Something feels strange
I'm walking in the clouds
I'm almost touching the stars
Anything seems possible, imaginable

Am I dreamin'? (Dreamin', dreamin')
All normal things start to change
Can feel no gravity
I step outside the atmosphere
Nothing seems impossible, unreachable

How strange it feels, moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreamin'
Now, is this real or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'

I take a leap (A leap, a leap)
I should be scared, but I'm not
Traveling at the speed of light
Planets are flashing by
Like a shooting star I fly

How strange it feels, moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreamin'
Now, is this real or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'

As I'm waking up blind, I am trapped in a mindfall
So much regret, so much feelings
Are passing through my mind, it feels like my whole existence
Is about to end

I'm lost in time, it feels like I'm fading
(All that's left is my fate)
I'm lost within, I'm trapped inside of me
(My past is staring at me)

I am lost, so far away
I am lost, so far away

I feel so harmed, so much left to say
Abuse my life, my fate

It feels like I'm buried down into a black hole
The dust is choking me, what if there's no tomorrow?
Will I be dead? All these questions
I fall into my end

I'm lost in time, it feels like I'm fading
(All that's left is my fate)
I'm lost within, I'm trapped inside of me

A rich life free from promises

I've been running all night long
And the pulse is pounding in my chest
Now I am here, there are feelings that I just must express

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late
Open for me, cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late

Gotta get this outta my system
I've gathered my strength, ripped my blindfold off
I'm ready now, I have stayed in the dark with my mind switched off

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late
Open for me, cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late

I don't wanna be out here on my own
I don't wanna be outside in the cold
I don't wanna be completely alone
I just wanna be right where I belong

Don't try to help, we're alone in this war
All efforts will be futile, progressing bit by bit as I'm fighting to kill it
Replace all my frustration with new inspiration, watch me climb
Fighting this addiction, I'm bleeding

Evil's on my left, good is on my right
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

For once, listen to me, now I am crying it out
Tired of hiding it inside, now I am screaming it out
Replace all my frustration with new inspiration, watch me climb
Fighting this addiction, I'm bleeding

Evil's on my left, good is on my right
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

I am trying to figure me out, why I'm bleeding
No one will ever understand me; it's like I'm two faced
Understand me; it's like I'm two faced
Understand me

It was magical when I felt your touch
It's a strong memory still today
It feels so good with your body close
Those days are gone, time flies away
But it's what I'm dreaming of still today

I'm sad to see that this was all we had
But within my heart, you'll have a place deep within my heart
A special place for you no matter what was said and done
Within my heart, you'll always be inside my heart as long as I live

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go
Within my heart, within my heart
(Within my heart, within my heart)
Within my heart, within my heart

Within my heart

What once was strong and filled with passion
Has withered away and turned to nothing
But you're all I'm dreaming of still today

It's sad that what we had is dead and gone
But within my heart, you'll have a place within my heart
A special place forever, no matter what happened
You have a place in my heart, within my heart for eternity

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go
Within my heart, within my heart
(Within my heart, within my heart)
Within my heart, within my heart

Every night I have this dream
Will I find the right way back again into your open arms?
Every night you're in my dreams
And I know that we will meet again
It's written in the stars and within my heart

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go

Don't tell me to let go the past
'Cause it's all I've got
Though it all went too fast, memories will last

For what's wrong I apologize
Trying to go on with a broken heart
I thought it through like a thousand times
What went wrong, what went wrong?

I am trying so hard

You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here

I want you to know
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you here
I cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Not without you here

Don't tell me to, to let go of you
It hurts in me, say that it's not too late
That it's just a dream

From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry
Trying to go on with a broken heart
Can't get closure inside of this story
What went wrong, what went wrong?

Crazy weather
Too near the eye of the storm
The ice that cracks our walls
Our tiny shelter from the cold

We raise the curtain for endless rain
A tricky thought stuck in back of your brain
Slippery the cradle, water that burns
Silent the hour, waiting our turn

Our bodies our changing beneath the touch of the rain
We'll build a new constellation
We'll save ourselves for better days

Play for me
Play that on my grave now
You'll play for me
Play from the eye of the storm

We ran for shelter when everything changed
We made a promise to keep things the same
Play for me
Play for some kind of control
It keeps us whole

How hollow heart
Cracks the walls around me
Out of the eye of the storm
Endless the rain
Endless the rain

These are the rules
Learn to play
And what you take from here
No price can pay

You'll play for me now
Play for some kind of control
It makes us whole
Study the lines
Learn your part
You'll play for me
Play for some kind of control

Left outside
The frost leaves its mark
Saved, safe
In the dark

Play for me
Play that on my grave now
You'll play for me
Play from the eye of the storm

We ran for shelter when everything changed
We made a promise to keep things the same
Play for me
Play for some kind of control
It keeps us whole

White sheets run red
Red sheets burn white
This is not your bed
So very far from home again

Dirty river water runs all the way to your room
The water carries memories
Let them guide you

Take a breath and make your way back down
Against the stream

Upstream against the knives of cold
Will time destroy the weight of what we know?

Draw the map a circling spiral down
Destination your middle name
Momentum saved
Now just wait

Soak this in river water

You might be asleep or you might be awake
It doesn't matter now
Dirty river water holds the waste that you make
It doesn't matter now

Upstream against the knives of cold
Will time destroy the weight of what we know?

Now just wait

Your white sheets run red

You haven't heard a word of what I've said
You can't drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

You haven't heard a word of what I've said
You can't drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

And this is not your bed

You still believe what you see
Your obsession
Reflection
Concession
Aggression
Your reflection
And you believe what you see in the prism
Who would you be?
A phantom in the glass
Holding on to me

And you only believe what you can see

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Seeing what you want to see
See what you fear to be

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Show me what you want to be
Seeing what you want to see

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Seeing what you want to see
Show me what you want to be

Your obsession
With the reflection
Is a concession
To our regression

It's easy to make that choice alone
We'll never know whose won

I want to carve my name in her noise
Find comfort in these childhood toys

Pump the brakes, you're a red-flag, red light
Holdin' up for stop signs. I'll never be sloppy seconds
Go ahead, take them back, your one, two, three minutes
All you do is take, take, takin' off the little
Got More goin' on I'd rather be eating glass,
Stick hot needles in my eyes,
Go ahead and tap that ass
Draw them up, yeah like there's candy
Girl I ain't tryin'a connect or paint a picture
I'm not in it, never will be
You can't be me, get your freak on,
You can suck it, they've all seen it
And you liked it, now who wants it?
Cotton candy sugar high
Break your bones when you come down
You're a one trick, my trick pony who's next to hop on
Ride, ride, ride...
Bout to bring a blood spill
We've both been there, what's the next stop? I won't sit still
Back to bring up what's real
We've both been there, what's the next stop? I won't sit still

Let's play musical chairs
One of my favorite games
Especially now
That you and I
Have traded place
You walk around
In shoes that don't fit
For a change
There is no way for you
To win this race
Kris Kross and turn your shirt
Inside out
You like to think
I can figure you out but
The tables have turned
What goes around
Comes around
You're about to get burned
Flip the script
You're checkin' in
I'm checkin' you out

You're just too sweet
Until you get on my nerves
And hurt like cavity
You left a bad taste in my mouth
My Sour Patch Kid
You and me
It's not mystery
No magic trick
Let me hear this broken record again
Just press repeat

I can be your new favorite waste of time
And you'll be mine
All I want is your attention
It's all the same thing
Are you in?
What's it gonna be?
Don't roll with the punches
Make it hard for me
Baby


Drop you like a needle on the record
Scratch my itch
Watch you walk in circles
Hit the beat

Drop you like a needle on the record
Flick my switch
Go around in circles
Hit the beat

Drop you like a needle on the record

So we've been talking about 'cool' and its uh ramifications, and how it applies to the hip scene. But maybe you could give us some examples now, of the opposite of cool - 'uncool', just exactly what is 'uncool'?
Yeah, why-n't-we have some thoughts on that...

It-it-it's uncool to nod on the street corner waiting for the light to change.
And uh it uh... It-it's uncool to let anybody know your uncle is a registered pharmacist, uncool for the whole family.
You know, it's uncool to buddy with a known fink.
And it's uncool to ask "Where'd you get it?"
It's disastrously uncool to let friends use your penthouse as a forwarding address for packages from Mexico.
You know and it's uncool to ask "Where'd you get it?"
And it is uncool to wear shades after sunset.

Don't wake me up, I'm winning wars inside my head.
And maybe I'm weak, but not beneath the covers of this bed.
Asleep, I'm undefeated in this world of mine.
So let me stay inside this dream, and keep me from the light.
I built this place behind my eyes you'll never see.
And you can move my body, but please keep my mind asleep.
Beyond the galaxies where there's no space or time.
I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies.
I
I feel it in my bones, escape the world I know.
It's all in my control.
I
Just wanna see this way, blood pumping in my veins.
I feel it. I feel it!

Behind the darkness, there's a sea of neon lights.
And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside.
Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free.
Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality.
It's not enough for me to paint with black and white.
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life.
You think you travel far and never see the stars.
Cause the only way is if I say you can follow me that far.
I
I feel it in my bones, escape the world I know.
It's all in my control.
I
Just wanna see this way, blood pumping in my veins.
I feel it. I feel it!

I was born on a highway in a trainwreck
With a heart that was beatin' outta my chest
So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up
If I don't get it soon I know I'll bleed until I drop

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

There's a darkness and a hollow on the highway
Every cross on the road side tells a story
So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up
The story never ends as long as we have blood and guts

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
Can't get enough
I can't get enough

It ran off the track, 11/79
While the immigrants slept, there wasn't much time
The mayor came callin' and got 'em outta bed
They packed up their families and headed up wind

A poison cloud, a flaming sky
200,000 people and no one died
And all before the pocket dial
Yeah

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

Now I'm stranded, tied on the tracks
There's no hero, there's no villain
There's nobody I can blame, the story's still the same
I'm never satisfied, it's a problem with my brain

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

(Can't get enough) I can't get enough

Again and again and again I get tested
Feels like the walls are closing in I can't escape it
It's everywhere I turn so I can't run from it
So many things I see make me sick to my stomach
Feel compassion and pain look at the world with disdain
But know that I'm part of the problem and it drives me insane
I see no light at the end of the tunnel
So I take no solace in a bullshit empty promise

So what the fuck am I supposed to do

But live like I got nothing left to lose

Again and again and again there's no end
To the bullshit and the drama and the fake fucking friends
It's me against the world I've made my peace with that
But fighting through this life alone I find no peace in that
Day after day I get more disillusioned
With every fuckin' person on earth myself included
Everybody's got there demons to battle
I just don't know how much more of this shit I can handle

I feel the weight of the world and the pressures so great
I can feel my heart break every step that I take
But I keep on yeah I gotta be strong
Gotta make my momma proud, I gotta be my father's son

I keep on

Say what you want about us, you can't doubt us
Fought every inch of an up hill battle and now look
Catch us in the clouds livin' the life we dreamed of
Chillin' how the gods chill with a chill demeanour

So kill the drama we done it, you can't debate it, we made it
I'm blowing kisses at bitches while we drink gin by the cases
Haters talk shit still 'till they get lock jaw
While we shoot the shit with legends of game so fuck y'all

We seen 'em come, we seen 'em go and all we know
We don't give a fuck, yo, we are unfuckwithable
We don't just shine we illuminate the whole show
Yeah, you know we are unfuckwithable

If you feelin' like I'm feelin' let me feel it when
I hear you, yo, let's go we are unfuckwithable

Yeah

So kill the bitchin' and listen, you can't deny we on fire
If your rebuttal is muddled, it's cause my IQ is higher
Be lying if I said I gave a fuck regardless, for every 1 that haten 100 adore us

We seen 'em come, we seen 'em go and all we know
We don't give a fuck, yo, we are unfuckwithable
We don't just shine we illuminate the whole show
Yeah, you know we are unfuckwithable

If you feelin' like I'm feelin' let me feel it when
I hear you, yo, let's go we are unfuckwithable

You've got to find her. (You've got to find her.)
Your mother ain't fit to be alone.
Her rosary beads are gone, there's only one place she'd be.
The sun is nearly up, put your jacket back on and walk down the street.

Feel the wind start to shift, cold and biting.
Just like everything that's changed.
When you do find her, (when you do find her)
Take the only family that you've got back to home.

Head down, walk through the crowds and the families downtown.
You jealous bitter old man, it's just yourself you can't stand.
The man that took away your wife, coward that left you behind,
You would kill them both if you could. (Kill them both if you could)
Head down, cigarette in hand.
Concrete, cold brick and sando the place where she prays,
Where she suffers her days.
Sleepless nights with the dirt when the addiction hurts.
Up to that old white oak door church.

And that's where you find her in that last pew.

You touch her cold hand, your mother is gone.
In front of her God, needle in her arm.
The family plot will be filled.
The perfect ending to a tragedy.
Put her in the cold wet ground.
Finally at peace with her husband now.

Lost all will, empty house.
Hours strain, but months pass alone with your gun.
Blue-collar shipyard, your days have gone.

Lost it all for the promise of a normal life.
All taken from you when you lost your wife.
So you sit in that chair, waiting for death, barrel to your head.

You need to get out of this house.
I'll walk you down to town.
We'll go act our age, kick rocks, waste summer days.
Penny candy at the general store,
I'd buy us a pop if I had more.
Keep walking inland all day,
Spitting and cursing each others name.

"Ain't this what, ain't this what brothers are supposed to do?"
The blood between us, makes it all but true.

So we roll on through
Out past the quarries and sandpits too.
Swim out among the rocks and cliffs,
Ignorant youth keeps us from death.
Find our way out to the tracks.
The sun, it beats down on our backs.
Heaven help us if there's a train,
Dodge it like the beaches of Normandy.

"Ain't this what, ain't this what brothers are supposed to do?"
The blood between us, makes it all but true.

We saw that smoke rising over trees
And I swore, I swore, I swore,
That train was out for me.
So I held him tight and felt those tracks rumble underneath.
He swore, he swore if I didn't let go he would knock me off my feet,
And that's what he did.

Unwanted, but breathing.
In the next room, sleeping.
My mother, she's crying and my father's been drinking.
In our run down apartment, where the roof is still leaking.
He's cursing and cussing, it's just the whiskey talking.

I've got lots of memories like this one.
Of empty days and nights spent tired and lonesome.
When I think back to all of it,
Well it's all too much,
Well it's all too much when you're just a little kid.

My little brother, just a newborn baby.
In the image of my mother, she says he's a blessing.
But not to my father, oh how he hates him.
"An undeserving mistake." He calls him a burden.

I've got lots of memories like this one.
Of picking sides and picking fights between them.
When I think back to all of it,
Well it's all too much,
Well it's all too much when you're just a little kid.

When I wake up in the morning it all feels like a bad dream,
One that follows you and haunts you endlessly.
Yeah haunts me endlessly.

Broken and beaten from the abuse and the cheating,
The addiction, the lying and the promise of leaving.
While my old man was a bastard, I admired and loved him.
Us two kids, we were born in to a family, not a fortune.

Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can't stand the sight of yourself.

"Now that you're gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you."
You drink until you're sick.
"I trace the grooves in your stone."
Plot where you'll bury him,
The man that left you alone.

Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can't stand the sight of yourself.

You drink until you're sick,
And feel the dew in the grass.
As the sun's coming up,
Watch a funeral pass.

"Now that you're gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you."
You think to yourself,
"That should have been me."
Two in the family plot, but you wish it were three.

Climb those cemetery walls again; (climb those cemetery walls)
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again, (climb those cemetery walls)
You can't stand the sight of yourself.

Bury him in the cold wet ground.
Familiar faces would have made him proud.
The military and the working man,
The history of the life he lived.

"Can you feel that soil covering your coffin?"
Can you feel?

So what are you going to do?
Be the hero that your father was?
So what are you going to do?
Be the man he made you to be?

And you are your father's son.
Dear father, dear father.
Be the hero that your father was.
Be the man he made you to be.

The war-torn stories that he told you
You've got a hell of a lot to live up to.
An airborne man with a scar and wound,
"Never make a promise that you can't prove."

Dear father, dear father.

So what are you going to do?
Be the hero that your father was?

The way she looked at you, tears streaming down her face.
You felt the brush of her dress as she walked away.

And that's all it took, sat down to buy her a drink.
An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same.
And that's the way that it's been, years later she took your name.
Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her.

Another night at the Copper Coin.
Another night, another night.

And that's all it took, sat down to buy her a drink.
An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same.
And that's the way that it's been, years later she took your name.
Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her.

Tell me about the old days.
Another night at the Copper Coin.
Tell me about the old days.
Put the sun into the sea.

Because there ain't nothing like your smile,
Your legs and those eyes.

Tell me about the old days.

And I will beg
And steal and borrow
To keep you safe for your whole life.

Hello, my dear
It's so nice to see you here
How long has it been?
Oh, it feels like years
But I'm sure it's just been days

Been walking around alone
Drunk and missing you at home
You know I'll never feel the same
Or ask another girl to take my name

Think I've been stopping by too much
Don't want you to get sick of me
On my way home from the Copper Coin
It's this or I jump into the sea

And I'll never forgive myself
For not being there to protect you
I should have been at home
Instead of out trying to forget you

Just one fight
And I'm out the door
What kind of man am I?
I swore I'd never leave your side

Hello, my dear
It's so hard to see you here
How long has it been
Since we put you in the ground?
Oh, it feels like days, but it's been years

Oh, and please don't call me baby
It's just too hard to hear
Too hard to hear
Leave you flowers at your headstone
Just sit and talk to you my dear, my dear

Let's talk about your friends
Let's talk about the summer
And how you wish it wouldn't end

Did I forget to tell you
How pretty you looked in that dress?
In the first time that I saw you
You cleaned the mess from my head

And I don't mind
If we take our time
No, I don't mind

Lets go walkin' on the boardwalk
Dip our feet into the sea
Lets find ourselves lost for hours
Until we find ourselves a drink

Lets talk that sun into setting
Just need the sound of your voice
Need that calming and the comfort
Something to drown out the noise

And I don't mind
If we take our time
'Cause I'm all yours
If you're all mine

Something I've been meanin' to tell you
About three years and a day
I'd very much like to get married
Maybe have kids and move away

'Cause there ain't nothing like your smile
Your legs and those eyes
I will beg and steal and borrow
To keep you safe your whole life

And I don't mind
If we take our time
'Cause I'm all yours
If you're all mine

"Where were you every night that I woke up alone?"
Cold sweat keeps you up.
"This ain't no kind of home."

"Come pick me up."

"Damn those boys at the bar,
Damn the way that you drink."
Cold sweat, sleepless nights,
When your hands start to shake.
"Damn that pier where you sit,
Damn your vengeance for him
There's no bringing him back,
Your father is buried and dead."

But you can't let go of that hero's death.
And you've been left with,
Left with his debt.

You couldn't fight for your country
And your mother is an addict.

"How dare you?"
"This ain't no kind of home."

"Come pick me up."

"Damn that man that you humor,
He only wants one thing from you.
Damn those looks that you give him.
Parlor tricks and I'm played for a fool."

You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The same chair as your old man
Your mother's worse than you think
Sunken eyes and a withering frame
The needle quiets the longing
That poison, it fills...; it fills her veins
(One by one, one by one)

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain't no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The longer you sit at the ocean
You lose more time than you think
Your blood runs cold
Wind biting under your coat
Pull it tight to your chest
Your mother is praying for death
Much more than you know

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain't no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

"You coward (you coward)
This is your fault
Our family
Has lost everything"


Look down at your hands and your lit cigarette
Put it to your lips and breathe it in
Everything starts to fade and your body is numb
And when you wake in the morning you're in the house all alone

"Dear God, what have you done?"
Those words ring loud in the back of your head.
That bottle lies in a thick, blood red.

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

"Dear God, where have you gone?"
Your brother is gone in the blink of an eye.
That January night, our father lays cold.
"Where are you going to go?
You're only seventeen years old."

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

Those cold steel tracks beneath your feet,
Those same rail ties where you dodged those trains.
When we were just two kids, it still feels the same;
That warm blood rush when the train comes.
(When the train comes)

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
"I will find you, and put that vice to your head.
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again."

As the waves crash, the clouds roll.

Sit on the dock waiting for the sun.
Wait for the coward but he never comes.
Pray for revenge on him.
Steam rises as the boats come in,
One by one (one by one).

You know she is gone,
You know there's no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.

When you come home to find her lying on the floor,
You're reminded of those sleepless nights
That will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Blue collar shipyard, any way to keep her alive.
Sun up to sun down,
Blistered hands and a parched mouth.

You know she is gone,
You know there's no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.

You're going to find him, and make him pay.
Stumble out to the bar.
"Take one more look at her,
And it will be the end of your days.
You low-life bookie, you don't scare me.

I ain't settling no debt,
I ain't saving no face.
One more drink then I'm gone
And then I'll drag you out of this place."

Put it down for the courage,
Your fists clench with the blood rush.
White knuckles when the hit lands,
Cold concrete and blurred vision.

Stumble home from the bar.
Stuttered steps home to your front door.
On the tip of your tongue, your remorse.
Shamed by the loss and defeat.
Shamed by your let down to her.
The same walk as that first night.
Now alone you know that this ain't right.
Better days and the promise you made,
Ain't no man supposed to walk out that way.

Her ring lies in the thick red,
Your tears swell, and the room spins.
"Dear God, what have I done?"


You left her, and he took her, he laid with her.
You bastard's son.

With the blackout
And the bloodstains,
Your teeth clench,
Then the pain comes.

Lost in your own head, but then a knock at the door.
Put down that drink, your steps creaking the floor.
Go and get the gun, distract yourself from death.
Back against the door, your hands are starting to sweat.
Slowly cock the gun, slowly move to the side,
Slowly turn the handle, slowly open it wide.
You catch a glimpse of his face. Your heart sinks in your chest;
Your hands start to shake because you know that it's him.
Just the coward and you standing silent, dead air.
So you pull him inside into your father's chair.
"Your mother is dead, all thanks to you.
Her addiction got worse after you left you damn fool.
What you did to our father, I promised you'd pay up.
I'm going to take your life, but it don't feel like enough."
Cold steel to his head, walk him to his death.

Walk him down past the white oak doors.
Walk him out past the boardwalk and your old shipyard.
Your pistol in his side, make him pay.
On the outskirts of town, pass the old quarry now.
Walk him down to those cold steel tracks.
You stumble drunk with the gun in his back.

"Now get down on your knees on the tracks where you shamed me.
But this time, the dodge ain't going to end so pretty.
Either a bullet or that train steaming just ahead
Is going to end your days. You coward little kid."

You sit and you stir, while he waits for his death.
You'll never forgive him, and you never did forget.
He'll never see the sun again.
Make him pay off his debt.
Stand on those tracks, cold steel under your feet,
Barrel to his temple. "Your rotting mother, you will soon re-meet,"
You whisper in his ear, feel his whole body shake.
In an instant he's got your arm, he's got your gun, you're held down by his weight.
You feel the cold steel above and below.
You feel your stomach tie in knots when the train whistle blows.
You feel the warm of the blood where the barrel digs in.
From your cheek to your mouth, you taste the sweat and the tin.
You don't cry, you don't beg. You've been waiting for this.
For the coward, or for death, just to see your wife again.
That train is so close, so loud and so clear.
Your hands stop shaking and it's all that you hear.
Just like father. "You took him.
If this is how it's going to be
I would rather die at the hands of my own family."

I hope this finds you well
A father lost and mother dear
The family that's kept me here
A hard lesson learned, and I've learned it well
How to lose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say
I'll never raise a hand to the ones I love ever again
You begged and you prayed
For your god and his grace
To keep you safe
To save you from me

My broken spirit and back
My calloused shaking hands
The ache I carry in them
Are my grief and skeletons
The weight you carried inside
A weight that ain't my bloodline
Blackout the sunrise
I count these burdens as mine
And still all you see is that bastard in me

Believing in hell
A father lost and mother dear
The family that I squandered here
A hard lesson learned, and I forgot it all
How to lose everything

Can you hear those birds sing?

Means we're closer to shore
Means we're closer to home
Further from love and war
Further from what made sense
What we were born to do
What kept the blood in our veins
Keep my veins thin with booze

Kept my hand on my gun
And my gun by my side
Kept the moon in my thoughts
With the sun in my eyes

Kept my head hanging low
Kept my gun by my side
My brother's name in my head
And the tears from my eyes

Kept the blood in my veins
Kept the blood in my veins
Brother's name in my head
Kept the blood in my veins

Had me praying for death
For me and my friends
So we would never wake up
To our lovers again

Because every lover had lied
When they said we'd be fine
When they said in good faith
They would sleep alone every night

Hope to come home in one piece
With our boys by our side

Now we're ragged and the torn
Like the flags that we fly
Like the ones we lay down
On a coffin so clean

See those eyes staring back
The boys we used to be

Kept the blood in my veins
(I re-read the postcards you sent, wish the truth was a lie)
Kept the blood in my veins
(The waves on the hull, throw your words off the side)
Brother's name in my head
(The ship takes the deed and dying back home)
And the blood in my veins
(I want to sing to the depths, with the letters you wrote)

Kept the blood in my veins
Kept the blood in my veins
Brother's name in my head
And the blood in my veins

I'm giving in to my vices bottle in hand

Dear old friend
I think I'm slipping again
At the end of my rope
This pain, this pain in my head

I could use your sage old advice
Some words to calm me down
I ain't been sleeping much nights
With my girl sleeping all over town

Short list of my enemies
Since days I spent in the trench
But he ain't no man, he's a cheat
A coward staring down death

Dear old friend
In this letter I'll never send
I confess I'd kill them both where they stand

I left a piece of me in foreign country side
And in my own home, I'm a stranger now

And when I heard my name
My stomach sank to the floor
I can't take any more

I'm drinking every drop
Until the aching will stop
Until you pull that rig out of your arm

There wil be no relief
We will never be free
Of the horrible things
And the pain that we've seen

And that same man was told

When I gave my brother a coffin

He was the air in my lungs

The man that I'll never be

A cigarette and a drink
To burn away my night
And keep the ache in my chest
And his candle burning bright

These words they fall on deaf ears
There is only guilt, death and grief
Your god forgot about us
He's just a thief and a cheat

A cigarette and a drink

Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

To every dying wish I've had of us leaving
This old ghost town
Still dragging us down
To pull you out of this hell you've been living in
With the needle
And every dying wish I've had that you would clean up
Your ups and let downs pulling me underground
With every tired lie you tell just to fill your arm

You thin your veins with the dirt
With the hurt
With the memories and the pain

Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

And I lost my faith in your god
In your word
In every promise that you break

Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

So I walk the same way home each night
To find that back-alley pusher and take his life
And I ain't ashamed for what I've done
I'll take an eye for an eye until every junkie is blind
The river bed holds the blood and the knife

And I ain't ashamed for what I've done
I took his eye as a prize
The man who laid with my wife
Lays at the bottom of that river where the sun never shines

Another day when the sun ain't shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on


Still holding on

Another day when the sun ain't shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on
Still holding on
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

Dear hope I lost you,
Found solace in a bottle
Now I'm my mother's only son

Brother of mine
I woke up with the sunrise
With an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep at the bottom
Of the blue pacific

Brother of mine
I woke up with the bottle
And an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep in the iron
Bottom, blue pacific

I find no comfort
I find no solace
I've got no use for these

I find no closure
I find no peace
Just these scarred up memories

I've got your letters
I've got your good luck
In your rabbit foot I keep

Around my throat
To keep me from dying
You've always been protecting me

Dear hope I lost you,
Found solace in a bottle
Now I'm my mother's only son

Brother of mine
I woke up with the sunrise
With an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep at the bottom
Of the blue pacific

Brother of mine
I woke up with the bottle
And an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep in the iron
Bottom, blue pacific

March. 1945 unwanted from his first breath.
A mother's blessing born, a father's burden worn.
The bright shine of the sunrise along the tile floor to the open door.
With blood on the streets she lay on the mattress.
Staring aimlessly.
Numb, dark and decayed
On the bathroom floor of their rundown apartment.
Scraping fingers on tile just to feel something.
Unwanted by a bastard father.
Unwanted, but through the hazel eyes of his mother.
She's praying for god to save her.
"Please save me." but when she needs him most, he doesn't answer.
Another rosary, another unanswered plea.
"Please take us away, please let us be safe.
Let everyone that sees me forget my face."
But all she gets is the drunk with his fists and that old devil look in his eye.
Him and Jack, that gambling debt, that old devil look in his eye.
And without warning he raises his hand to her and says,
"Your god can't hear you, not down here.
No one will save you because no one cares."
And with her newborn boy, they would cry until the early morning light.
It was the first of many, many sleepless nights.

That soap box song stuck in his head.
Burdens lie in graves past by.
He carries his weight. that anthem for the disenchanted rings loud in waves of grain.
Heavy hearted hymns heard in slums fade out on those country roads.
Hope burning in his lungs.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Sleeping under sky.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Days turn into nights.
Sleep sound, the sun's out.
Sleep long, sleep well.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Memories come flooding back,
He prays his mother's God has saved her soul.
That soap box song still in his head.
Miles lost to heat and rain.
He carries his weight.
That message for the misdirected rings true to this day.
Heavy hearted hymns sung in fields.
He stops along that country road to listen as they sing.
"Swing low, swing low chariot for me. Swing low, swing low. Pray my soul to keep."
Rest now, the sun's down. Rest long, rest well.
Swing low, swing low."
Redemption lies in an old farm house.
"Room and board for the strong hands we need. All i can offer is roof over head. Another day, another dollar."

"There's no place for me."
A man of nowhere, a man of black heart from the dead end streets.
"Regret runs through me. I am no one, I am nothing, I am a man of defeat. What's left for me?"
Thought of those open roads, his mother praying all alone, that vagrant anthem and the field sung hymns, the cowardice forever following him.
"What's left for me? The world has turned it's back on me. There's no place for me."
A sullen walk to the chapel stairs.
"Regret runs through me."
A hard pull on that white oak door to face up those fears.
"What brings you here my son?"
"I've been a horrible man. I killed my father, I killed my brother, I left my mother in your God's hands."
"Clasp your hands and count your sins. Kneel at the pew until the sermon begins. No judgment cast down this day, will set you free. You are forgiven my son, you are blessed and redeemed. You've found absolution here son, but only from me."
"What's left for me?"
A sullen walk to the steeple top to look over the city.
He carves his name in that old brass bell, so when it rings he can hear it in hell.
One last look to that western sky, one last wish he could have changed his life.
"I ain't no wicked man."
He let his fleet slip from under him, unwanted.

It still looks the same here after all these years.
The junkies and the steamboat men, the sun never set on them here.
He walks to his rundown home, hell-bent to find his mother, but all that fear comes back when he is greeted by his brother.
"It's not the same here."
"Oh, i never thought you would come right to me. I've spent years on these docks just waiting after you left, we were left with nothing. Every day what you did ran through me. You selfish fuck. it's your fault, can't you see? Your addict mother is dead. now, are you happy? You're left with nothing. now. You'll pay your debt to me. You coward, cheating thief. Down at those long steel tracks, your life is my payback."
"I bet you wish you were dead."
They walk the rails with a gun to his head.
And so he lay on the ties, just waiting. those racing thoughts through his head came rushing.
He slips out from the weight of the elder.
The younger's fear once again toppled over.
And now it's his upper hand, he sees the steam overhead.
This will be the last the elder breathes again.
Roll on through, that train bearing down.
As it ended his days, he somehow knew it would always be this way.
So ends that cold heart's legacy.

Roll on through to the other side of town.
Passed the quarry, the river beds, over bridges and bunker sheds.
Roll on through to the pits and the rail car yard.
"This is where you prove your worth."
A brother's dare, that devil's smirk.
"Oh, this is the way it will always be."
A kid brother in the shadows of a cold heart's legacy.
"Oh, this is where we see who runs first. It's you and me and the train. The steel tracks and the dirt. Oh, you can never live up to me."
And so he stood trembling, waiting for smoke above the trees.
Roll on through. He could feel it rumbling, he could feel it beneath his feet. Roll on through.
"Closer now, hold your ground. steadfast, ignore the sound."
Everything went quiet just before the rush took over his head.
The pull and the push of the engine, think back with the coal and the steam.
The racing thoughts, the questions, the adolescent rivalry.
And with a nod from the elder, the younger's fear topples over.
Over rails and over timber. "That's no dodge, you fucking coward."
And the train rolls on. "Yellow-belly go home." and the train rolls on.

He awoke in a cold sweat to those old sounds of heartbreak.
His brother at his side screaming "This isn't your fight."
But that rush took over his head and he came to his mother's side.
And he found himself alone with that devil rambling.
"Oh, well the money's all gone and she can't pay the rent with that needle in her arm."
He clenched his fists.
"What did she ever do to you, but raise us by herself when you were too drunk to come through?"
He took a swing.
"That's some nerve you got kid."
"Yeah, well they'll put that on your tombstone as the last thing that you said. I never wanted to kill a man, like i want to kill you, man."
The years of pain boiled over, trading blows across the counter.
And when that devil was down he grabbed for his empty old friend Jack.
He caught his eye as he took his last breath and that vice went to his head again and again.
"Dear God, what have you done?" cried out his mother.
"That devil drunk was no father. Another name on a list for unpaid bookies and gambling debts."
That spiteful stare of his brother.
"I ain't no forgiver or forgetter. I'll make you pay for this when you least expect it."
He washed the blood from his hands, kissed his mother and stepped into cold night air.

"if you're always running, you ain't no kind of man. face up your fears kid, fight for what you take stock in. out here on rolling hills, there ain't no alibis. only sweat and dirt, only that open sky. if you take nothing more than these simple words, with your head held high kid, you will have your day. you can leave hardened, i won't think twice of it. if you got a battle back home, you got no reason to stay." out there on rolling hills, he thought of days back home. all the pain and hurt, his mother praying alone. sleep never came for him, no rest for wicked men. in those starless skies, the moon shined shame on him. he found redemption in pale saints that took him in. his grey eyes, hopefulness, that only youth can feel before life sours them. "where you from, where you been?" the boy would ask. he could never answer, it was the truth he lacked. "i'm from nowhere kid, i've been to hell and back. i'm a loner kid, i got no grace and no tact." he had nothing more than those simple words. he was a runner and a coward always losing his way. still no sleep for him. "i ain't no wicked man." there would be no night like this for him ever again. he would change his fate, he would mend the breaks. he left that night with parting words to lead his way. "don't you be like me." and so that moonlit sky shined praise down on him.

As a kid the summers seemed so long.
The dusk; a never ending song.
Too much, too young.
He'd never hear it again.
A walk through the dismal streets, the alleys where the junkies sleep.
Too much, too young.
"That will never be me."
Slow, hand in hand to the boardwalk's end.
His mother's words like the biting wind.
"Please don't leave me."
He'll never hear them again.
"Keep quiet, stay out of sight."
Her sunken eyes that used to burn so bright.
"Please don't leave me."
So he hid pressed against the wall, under stairs in the darkened hall.
The sound of heartbreak reminded him of home.
Shadows move slow across the floor, a minute seemed like a day or more.
The end of heartache when she opened the door.
The sights, sounds, smell of burnt out shame, pride, spite and love.
They all come here to die.
He sobs, "Please take me a away. Please mother bring us home safe on nameless streets the way we came."
Suddenly, she prayed for better days and for redemption.
Sullenly she prayed to keep from harm's way and for conviction.
But there's no forgiveness here.
No hope beyond that pier.
No way to get out now, not for her in this dead end town.
And that drunk is waiting up, him and jack and the empty cup.
"Where you been? What you on? Who'd you fuck?"
One more drink to toast good luck.
She gets a stiff hand from the old like the bourbon he's been drinking.
Black out.

He walks the streets collar up to the snowfall.
Holes in pockets and knees.
Sleeps in bar rooms and horse stalls.
But you can't stay too long in one place.
"Move along kid, we don't like your face."
Mother's hold children close out of fear.
Father's curse under breath as they sneer.
He walks the streets, years pass by with the snowfall.
Time is wasted in drink, days begging and lost souls.
Holds no merit in vagrants in boxcars.
Down in hell you best know who your friends are.
"Not so proud scrounging for your next meal. No alibis sold when with devils you deal. How does it feel to be all alone with no direction? Home is never home, it's just the place where you came from."
"Home is never home," writ on walls of the church and the hostels.
"Home is never home," said by martyrs and lost souls.
"Home is never home," said the prophet in plain clothes as he strummed his guitar.
And he screamed, and he sang:
"Well I've been tired because I don't sleep that well on trains.
Well i got ups and downs but days are all the same.
I've been low but it never gets me down.
Well I've been thrown out, I've been let down, I've been shamed.
Well I've had hardships, I've been stripped of pride and name.
I've been low but it never gets me down
And i spent drinkin' all the worry from my head
In days spent wonderin', wishin' I was dead.
If only i could muster the words out from my mouth.
I would sing.
Oh i would sing.
I'd take the next train out.
Cause I've been hopin' I've been prayin' there's some God.
So when i die I'm saved and found and I'm not lost.
Cause all he's done, all for me is take away the ones I love.
And i spent drinkin' all the worry from my head.
In days spent wonderin', wishin' Q was dead..
If only I could muster the words out from my mouth.
I would sing.
Oh, i would sing.
I'd take the next train out.
I'm gonna take it..."

He found himself waiting again.
Out at the crossroads, out on the lam.
This time not running, this time by right.
A road-side hitcher waits for headlights.
"The blues won't bring me down."
That pick-up truck stopped. "Where you headed, kid?"
"Back to the boardwalk coast to fix the wrong I did."
That old man would bring him just as far as he could.
His hellhound sniffing out for a trace of any good.
The hope he's chasing.
The blues he carried are dead and buried.

Hard rain fell. Chalk it up to a failure.
Push through the cold weather.
Racing heart, slow the beat, push through the defeat.
No one knows, just push through the deadbeats, junkies, liars and cutthroats.
The same walk, the same pier.
No one's going to remember him here.
"Just walk until you reach those long steel tracks."
That old familiar sting, the memories of rivalry.
Years passed and it's still here.
The same dirt, the same rails, the same fear.
And all the years of giving in rushed through his head again.
With no loss to match his gain, he rolled on to hop that train.
That rain fell hard.
Chalk the miles from his failure.
Trees sway with the weather.
Racing heart, slow the beat.
Every crossed town line is relief.
With no money and no name, state lines, borders rivers are all the same.
The city by dawn, a stranger with no history comes.
"Just rest your head where the sun sets. Fade out at sun down."

I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I watched you change

It's like you never had wings

Just like always
(Still I want some more)
Mirrors sideways
(Who cares what's behind)
Just like always
(Still your passenger)

(The chrome buttons, buckles on
Leather surfaces
These and other
Lucky witnesses)
Now to calm me
(This time won't you please)
Drive faster

(Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger)

Drop these down
Then put them on me
Nice cool seats there
To cushion your knees
Now to calm me
(Take me around again)
Don't pull over
(This time won't you please)
Drive faster

(Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows
Down to catch my breath again
Go and go and don't just
Drive me home then back again)

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Afraid I might lose her
So forget about me

'Cause back in school

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south, London town

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
"We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"

These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms

Still enough
Although I know you're not begging
Still as the thoughts running through your mind
Still enough
Although I know you're not begging
Give me a reason to make you mine

I will devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you've brought
Meaning to my life

Had enough
Although I see you're not running
Still are the thoughts running through your mind
Dead to love
The path that you are now taking
Show me the reason to make you mine

I will devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you've brought
Meaning to my life

Run to where the smallest ray of light will never find you
Run to where you will not need to shield your eyes
Run away from all the soulless, heartless fiends who hound you
Run away and let your memories go blind

When I devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you've brought
Meaning to my life

Sensation washes over me, I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago, I don't remember
Tear a hole so I can see my devastation
Feelings from so long ago I don't remember

Holding on, to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

Blind your eyes to what you see, you can't embrace it
Leave it well enough alone and don't remember
Cut your pride and watch it bleed, you can't deny it
Pain you know you can't ignore I don't remember

Holding on, to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me

Sensation washes over me
I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago
I don't remember

I'm just holding on, to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me

Into me...

Into me...

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools," said I, "You do not know.
Silence, like a cancer, grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you.
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells, of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sounds of silence

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Into the abyss will I run

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go

Yes I am stricken and can't let you go

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Onetta there in the corner stands
And she wonders where she is.
And the rain still hurts,
Some people seem to have everything.
Nine a.m. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell.
And she's looking real pretty.
She's waiting for her clientele.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Twenty–eight years have come and gone.
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in.
They really seem to need her there.
It's a sacrifice working day–to–day
For little money, just tips for pay.
But it's worth it all
To hear them say that they care.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Already knows she's seen her bad times.
Already knows these are the good times.
She'll never sell out, she never will, not for a dollar bill.
She works hard...

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

I. Someone Like Him
I never wanted to become someone like him so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd
Never be someone like him

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed
My independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision
So secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know
That I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm
Missing out this time

As far as I could tell
There's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself
Could this be everything
Then all I swore
That I would never be was now
So suddenly
The only thing
I wanted
To become
To be someone just like him

II. Medicate (Awakening)

A Doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years
Where have I been
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

A higher dosage she prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot
A brief awakening

I feel the relapse
Can't break free
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

III. Full Circle



Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the Ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with Diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for Nightmare Cinema show me the way to get back home again

(Running forward, falling back)
Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up)
Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle with careful with
That axe Eugene Gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again

(Running forward, falling back)
Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up)
Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I've come full circle

IV. Intervals

 Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path

 Asking questions
Search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you

 Try to break through
Long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath

 Loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire

 Tortured insanity
A smothering hell
Try to escape but to no avail

 The calls of admirers
Who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more

 Innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madman's impulsive designs

 Step after step
We try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium

V. Razor's Edge

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge

A perfect sphere
Colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began

I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line...

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted

I met this girl late last year
She said "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oh (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside

Ooh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not he end
I can't work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you're my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

A mess of this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping it stops
And though I've only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you're my road walking me home
Home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I've loved my lover
For how long I've loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I've loved my lover
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I've loved my lover
Now now
For how long, long I've loved my lover

Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you,
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing "We Found Love" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

I turn the light on, and see your pretty face
I turn the light off, wishing that I could free space
I turn away, and know you're never far away from me
So I stay for another day

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

I learn to run off so I can keep the pace
And never a moment goes by I wouldn't trade for your embrace
Skies of gray, I know you're never far away from me
And I stay for another day

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay with me?

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter which way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you

If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter which way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you

It pays to be insane
Indiana rain
I let go
And I made the same mistakes
Sleeping in the flame
I lost hope
Just to be alone

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

I need to hear you say please don't look away
I still want to let you let me in even when it ends
If you need to love me
Love me patiently just until you see I'm giving up
And just to make sure I've wasted all doubt
Just to make sure please wake me up now
And what won't let me down is my fear

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

I'm broken and it's hurting
And all you say is love me too
Don't take it if you know it's not enough
Maybe I'll be more tomorrow

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

Something in the way you want to be deceived
I see you sell yourself
You can trust your faith if it helps you to believe
For me it never helped
You can never suffer dissent
Never dreamt of leaving you again
And I can't pretend though I want you to
You've been a saint you can be again

I can't move on
Believe in anybody else
Until you are dead and gone or living again

Say you're something more than what shows
Because it's been so long
I need your hands intertwined again just to feel at home
You can never suffer dissent
Never dreamt of leaving you again
And I can't pretend though I want you to
You've been a saint you can be again

I can't move on
Believe in anybody else
Until you are dead and gone or living again

We end and begin
I can't stop dreaming
But I've been awake all along
To see you and break through is all I need to do
But I cannot stay when you're wrong
I cannot stay when you're gone

Somebody ought to draw the line
Having you next to me
We were both afraid to say what we think
It's part of the poetry
If I let you go and I walk away it's done
But isn't it enough to say I won't
Isn't it enough to say I can't?
And I just keep away for you
Keep away for me
You were a song to sing
A way to say I need you more
You need to stay

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

When it's hard to break it's hard to take
And the reasons why I never made it through
And I never gave you all the things that I wanted to
If I let you go and I walk away for reasons I will never know
I break
You pray

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

But you won't love a ghost
I don't and I feel you in my throat
Another taste of love
You'll never know
Never wait for it 'and now the hand you hold
Is now the hand that holds you down

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again

This isn't war
This isn't courage
This isn't how you're supposed to be
And all the things keeping you awake
Are leaving me afraid
This isn't war
This isn't courage
And I don't believe that you're okay
The reason why I forget to close my eyes
When you're next to me
I feel you're going to leave

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

The weight of loves forever trying
And it's enough to bury me
All the things keeping you awake
Are leaving finally

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

Always said the same way I'm okay
Always walk away in chains
You know we wish you'd come around
Because nothing's changed
But it doesn't feel the same

I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

I am singing songs so sing along

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no

I ain't a bad man
You could say that I am still my mother's son.
And I ain't seeing red
I am seeing everything I never was

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no
So where do we go from here?

I played the wrong hand on the other hand I played it right
And I'm taking up a throne that was already ready already mine

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no

So I'll just wait

Are you happy?

Yea you know me all the years I've been around
And the fears that you found out

You believe in faith and

So won't you save the part of me that's broke again
And don't be hateful if I'm unfaithful
So wait
Something tells me I'm a fake
Now lie to me or run away and hide from me
How you feel

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name

There's a part of me hoping you can find a better part of me
And I've been in shambles before
But I can't feel anymore
So wait
Something tells me I might break
Now lie to me or run away and hide from me
How you feel

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name

Been awake for so long
And you say I'll be my father's son
Now I can never tell a lie to you
Because I've seen what they can do
Being in love is so lost
And I will never look again
I hope
But I know

There's a part of me hoping you can find a better part of me

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name

I can feel you leaving
I can see you running out
It's faith
(Help me)
I can feel you leaving
It's a tale of what I don't have
The will to say
The filth that I became
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine

I can feel you leaving
We're burning bridges down to the fire below
Time to let it go
No you won't
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine

Show me something
Shake me from my haze
When I need your help
You never saw me coming no
Here in my personal hell
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine

Nothing left running alone
Everything was moving fast
Keeping pace with planes above
Nothing ever seems to last
I'm sorry you can't see where I'm running from
I hope to get away
Forget the way I sing the same old songs
But I always sing along

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see oh my love is it ever enough?
Because everybody seem to feel the same
And I don't know if I have a line
A line to make you want to wait
So now I'm guilt stricken silent with my head on the floor
And I'll never be the same
So to get away forget the way I play
The same old songs and make the same mistakes

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see me when it's done

And I'm learning not to love
Part of me going through emotions I can't show
Going through the motions of regret
I let go
And I'm learning I'm alone suddenly living in the moment
You both know you're falling from the same tight rope

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see me when it's done

You will let me go
And you'll know
You had it all
But say hello
Wait for me

Well I never had faith
I never had love
Do you believe in me?
You can have me but I'm broken in two
So say hello
Wait for me

And you wait for something on your own
And you wait for something all alone

This is a waking up
This is your final go
And I would never want to see you
Get torn apart
And I can't believe
I can't believe your apart of this world
You were a sick sad man from the start
And your not even worth my time
I can't be stopped
I'll just keep going all the way
You will try
But you will fail
Just say
It's over and it's done with
I drove around Chicago
Heading to Champaign
I passed right through a country
With a gorge as high as any
God has ever made
I saw a man beside the road
He said "Excuse me sir I think I've lost my way"
Then I told him as I pulled back
On the road and headed south
I've got no time to waste
I said I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
It doesn't matter anyway
It's the way
It's the way you want it
Everything
Everything in this place
It's the way
It's the way you want it
Everything
Everything in this place
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
This is a waking up
This is your final go
So don't you expect me to be there
When you fall
When you fall

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter

I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em

Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit

And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' it

Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth

While he's all over TV down talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like "Fuck it, I understand"
This is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?

It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk

Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous

Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us

We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further

But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws with the knockin' 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

Yeah, I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you want to cry

'Cause you're scared; I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears; daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move; mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us, I don't see us ever being together
Ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head, and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be all right
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be all right

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed or shot up on the block

And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryma start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat—one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a Rollin' Stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and, daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too: Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah; it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be all right
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be all right

And if you ask me, too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat; don't fuck with dad (haha)

Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans

You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew

That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No"
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven

But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together, too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans:
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass!
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night?

About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk

But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!
Damn...

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though"

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose

"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe"

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' "I don't give a fuck"
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

Album  Curtain Call
Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doctor ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a Mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal,
Silence covered the sky

Take me back to the rivers of belief

We'll rest in peace

I see love, I can see passion
I feel danger, I feel obsession
Don't play games with the ones who love you
Cause I hear a voice who says:
I love you, I'll kill you

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Look into the mirror of you soul
Love and hate are one in all
Sacrifice turns to revenge and believe me
You will see the face who'll say:
I love you, I'll kill you
But I'll love you forever

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)

I love the way that she breathes

I touched her ooohh,
She touched my ahhh,
It was the craziest thing.
I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me.

A certain girl, she took my hand and ran it up her thigh.
She licked her lips and pulled my hair
I fall in love for a night.

She can't behave and I'm just a slave,
Don't worry I'll be gone when the morning comes.

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion.
Leave me, go where you belong,
Higher heels and lipstick napkins,
Dying is your latest fashion.

The frustration, it's a regular thing
I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me.
A certain girl she took her hand and put in my lap
It's way too full she said "once you have me you'll always come back."

She can't behave and I'm just a slave,
Don't worry I'll be gone when the morning comes.

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins,
Dying is your latest fashion.

I know you love to resist
And all it takes is a kiss
And you just love to hate me.

You know you love all the lies
So don't act surprised
That I just love to hate you.

I kissed your lips, you pulled my hair
It was the craziest thing.
I love the girls who love to hate.
(Breathing)

(Whoa!) Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
higher heels and lipstick napkins

Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me (darling), go where you belong

So now you're running
It's hard to see clearly
When I make you angry
You're stuck in the past

And now you're screaming
So can you forgive me?
I've treated you badly
But I am still here

Sometimes I wonder
Why I'm still waiting
Sometimes I'm shaking
That's how you make me
Sometimes I question
Why I am still here
Sometimes I think I am going crazy

Can you help me understand?
And now you wish that you meant something
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
And now you wish that you met someone
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
(someone) (something to somebody else)

You look at me through clouded eyes
I know you see through my lies
See the sky, see the stars
All of this could be ours
Out of sight, out of mind
We've been through this a thousand times
Turn your back and then you make me feel so crazy

Can you help me understand?
And now you wish that you meant something
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
And now you wish that you met someone
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else

You know I would wait forever
Yes, I would wait (I would wait)

You know I would wait forever
Yes, I would wait

And now you wish that you meant something
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else

I want to be dead with my friends

Wide-eyed, brilliant, dynamic rest
I want to be dead with my friends

Where the iron sharpens the iron

I want to be dead with my friends
A vulgar, loud, unforgettable end
I want to be dead with my friends

Let boredom cease the beating of our purple hearts
Against this, even gods fight violently in vain
What chance could we have stood?
We're the last of the lost,
But now we are the first of the fashionably late

Loved ones decompose
You'll dance around the bones
But most of us are wholly ghosts
All of us were wholly ghosts

We made the scene when we made a scene
And though it was brief, it meant everything

Oh, what a pity, now they're bound to make us saints

Against this, even boys fight violently in vain
What chance could we have stood?
We're the last of the lost,
but now we are the first of the fashionably late

I refuse to be the only man put to rest in a mass grave

You were all there with me

Baby,
you got me all wrong.
And maybe,
I'm not all down and out
I'm high and I'm in.

Don't you know who I am?
I'm the jaded one with pop insensitivity.
When I finish struggling,
we can make our way to the dance floor,
and stand like strangers,
in an elevator stuck between stories.
I always find myself in the middle of your stories.

With the cameras as a witness I will suffer!

If everything I do is wrong then, by God, I'll do it right.

We don't dance no, no, no...
We got class!
No, we don't have any fun at all.
It's the new style and we know it!
We're not stunning, we're just stunned!

We're lying for a living!

Don't you know who I am?
I'm the real thing with low-key sensibilities.
I don't need what I've got,
half as much as everyone covets it!

Well, if loving me is wrong then goddamn you do it right.

It turns us on to turn you down!
We're turned on to turn you down!

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth

The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace

No!

It's like the pattern below the skin
You gotta reach out and pull it all in
And you feel like you're too close
So you swallow another dose
The pinnacle of happiness
Filling up your soul
You don't think you can take any more
You never wanna let go
To touch the roots of experience
The most basic ingredients
To see the unseen glitter of life
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife
Cherish the certainly of now
It kills you a bit at a time
Cradle the inspiration
It will leave you writhing on the floor

This is so unreal, what I feel
This nourishment, life is bent
Into a shape I can hold
A twist of fate, all my own
Just grit your teeth, make no sound
Take a step away and look around
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
The whisper is but a shout
That's what it is all about
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away

Like the sacred song that someone sings through you (through you)
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into (into)
Like the dream you know one day will come to life (life)
Try to hold on just a little longer (longer), stronger (stronger)

It's the jewel of victory
The chasm of misery
And once you have bitten the core
You will always know the flavor
The split second of divinity
You drink up the sky
All of heaven is in your arms
You know the reason why
It's right there, all by itself
And what you are, there is nothing else
You're growing a life within a life
The lips of wonder kiss you inside
And when it's over the feeling remains
It all comes down to this
The smoke clears, I see what it is
That made me feel this way

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth
The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace

This is so unreal, what I feel
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
Pump through your veins, can't explain
The element that's everything
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away

Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
Like the first time love urged you to take its guidance, in silence
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
Like the way you cry for a happy ending (ending, ending, ending, ending, ending)

(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)

Time waits for no one
Unjust and unkind
All dreams are left behind
In time... in time

I rust and decay
With every wasted day
In sorrow and dismay
My life, it fades away

Is nothing ever built to last?
Must precious moments always pass
With no regret and no restrain?
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Strung out on a sad refrain
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Time waits for no one
Unjust and unkind
All hopes are left behind
In time... in time

I rust and decay
With every wasted day
In sorrow and dismay
My life, it fades away

Is nothing ever built to last?
Must precious moments always pass
With no regret and no restrain?
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Strung out on a sad refrain
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Pain will fade in time
My dreams get lost in time
And love will die in time
As I will die in time

In time...

I think I found what I'm looking for
Behind those eyes and open door
That vacant stare, which I adore
I'm your slut and you're my whore

Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the pain
Let us just make believe
It's yesterday again

And mother, if you're watching, look away
And mother, if you're wondering
But don't know what to say...
Mother, if you're watching, look away
Just look away

I think I found what I'm looking for
So hit the lights, and shut the door
Listen carefully, here's the score
I'm your slut and you're my whore

Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the shame
Let us just make believe
It's yesterday again

And mother, if you're watching, look away
And mother, if you're wondering
But don't know what to say...
Mother, if you're watching, look away
Look away

It sometimes makes me sick inside
Ashamed of a life that I must hide
I know you'll never understand
I'm sorry there's no wedding band

But deep inside there's still that child
Innocent in a world gone wild
Obediant of your moral code
Scarred by the Christian overlord

But still I live by truth and love
I still have hopes in the above
I still have interest in the cross
But mother if you're listening, shut it off

Mother if you're watching, look away
Just look away
Just look away
Just look away

I'm in too deep, I've gone too far
I've lost all innocence and shame
I've attitude to be a star
I'm destined toward greater fame

I've got the look they say you need
I've got drive and inherent greed
And soon the world will know my name
I'm winning at a losing game

I'm the latest fashion
Your deepest passion
Upon your wall I'm hung
But like fashion trends
When the passion ends
People like me die young
People like me die young

I'm in the lap of luxury
The cover of the magazine
I'm who the world longs to be
I'm huge upon the silver screen

I'm well aware, and yes I know
That once I reach the top of this
There's only one place left to go
And money won't buy happiness

I'm the latest fashion

Upon your wall I'm hung
But like fashion trends

Some have listened to the things we've said

I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars

Look at me, look at me
Hands in the air like it's good to be
Alive, and I'm a famous rapper
Even when the paths are all crookedy

I can show you how to do-si-do
I can show you how to scratch a record
I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together

I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to "De Colores"
And "I'm Proud to Be an American"

Me and my friend saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took
I can do anything that I want, 'cause, look

I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome
No metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone
On the telephone

Look at me, look at me
Just called to say that it's good to be
Alive in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read

I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a livin' off a magazine
I can design an engine
Sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline

I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions,
I know how to run the business
And I can make you wanna buy a product

Movers, shakers and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the system
I can do anything with no resistance

'Cause I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone
With a microphone
And I can split the atoms of a molecule
Of a molecule
Of a molecule

Look at me, look at me
Drivin' and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top
My reach, is global
My tower, secure
My cause, is noble
My power, is pure

I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let 'em all die of exasperation
Have 'em all healed of their lacerations
Have 'em all killed by assassination

I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because

I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite
By satellite
And I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope
Through a telescope

And I can end the planet in a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust

I can ride my bike with no handlebars

I can ride my bike with no handlebars

There's a war going on for your mind
Media mavens mount surgical strikes from Trapper Keeper collages and online magazine racks
Cover girl cutouts throw up pop-up ads
Infecting victims with silicone shrapnel
Worldwide passenger pigeons deploy paratroopers
Now it's raining pornography
Lovers take shelter
Post-production debutantes pursue you in Nascar chariots
They construct ransom letters from biblical passages and bleed mascara into holy water supplies

There's a war going on for your mind
Industry insiders slave test tube babies to corporate crackheads
They flash logos and blast ghettos
Their embroidered neckties say "stop snitchin'"
Conscious rappers and whistleblowers get stitches made of acupuncture needles and marionette strings

There is a war going on for your mind
Professional wrestlers and vice presidents want you to believe them
The desert sky is their bluescreen
They superimpose explosions
They shout at you
"Pay no attention to the men behind the barbed curtain
Nor the craters beneath the draped flags
Those hoods are there for your protection
And meteors these days are the size of corpses"

There's a war going on for your mind
We are the insurgents

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense
Spinning infinity, but
The wheel is spinning me
It's neverending, neverending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

I'm the face that you have to face mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

What if I say I will never surrender?

This indecision got me climbing up the wall
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall
How could this come over me, thought I was above it all
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

(Choke!)
On our kiss, thought I'd save my breath for you
(Choke!)
On our kiss, thought I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope, I'm coming loose
I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope, I'm coming loose
I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope, I'm coming out of my head, into the clear
When you go, I come loose

These premonitions got me crying up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

(Choke!)
On our kiss, thought I'd save my breath for you
(Choke!)
On our kiss, thought I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope, I'm coming loose

Give me some rope I'm coming out of my head, into the clear
When you go, I come loose

Give me some rope, I'm coming loose

Give me some rope, I'm coming loose

I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it's complicated
And though I know you can't appreciate it
I'm only happy when it rains

You know I love it when the news is bad
And why it feels so good to feel so sad
I'm only happy when it rains

Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me
Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me

I'm only happy when it rains
I feel good when things are going wrong
I only listen to the sad, sad songs
I'm only happy when it rains

I only smile in the dark
My only comfort is the night gone black
I didn't accidentally tell you that
I'm only happy when it rains

You'll get the message by the time I'm through
When I complain about me and you
I'm only happy when it rains

Pour your misery down (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down on me (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down on me (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down on me (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down

You can keep me company
As long as you don't care

I'm only happy when it rains
You wanna hear about my new obsession?
I'm riding high upon a deep depression

I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains!

Hanging round my neck
I got you twisted round my finger
Crawling round my legs

The emptiness, the craziness
Satisfy this hungriness
Darling, how would it feel?

If we sleep together, will you like me better?
If we come together, we'll go down forever
If we sleep together, will I like you better?
If we come together, prove it now or never

Make me a pretty person
Make me feel like I belong
Make me hard and make me happy
Make me beautiful

The emptiness, the craziness
Satisfy this hungriness
Darling, how would it feel?

If we sleep together, will you like me better?

If we sleep together

You look so fine
I want to break your heart
And give you mine
You're taking me over

It's so insane
You've got me tethered and chained
I hear your name
And I'm falling over

I'm not like all the other girls
I can't take it like the other girls
I won't share it like the other girls
That you used to know

You look so fine

Knocked down
Cried out
Been down just to find out
I'm through bleeding for you

I'm open wide
I want to take you home
We'll waste some time
You're the only one for me

You look so fine
I'm like the desert tonight
Leave her behind
If you want to show me

I'm not like all the other girls
I won't take it like the other girls
I won't fake it like the other girls
That you used to know

You're taking me over
Over and over

I see more than I see
Then I see my life
And I feel more than I feel

I feel the center of me,
That peace inside
I remember the time
When life  was more like a fight

Is this the place
We will stay forever (and ever, and ever)
Or is it a dream I was waiting forever (and ever, and ever)
It feels so good and I never wish to wake up (never wish to wake up)
And it feels so real, I never want it to stop (to stop, to stop, to stop)

Never want it to stop

I opened my eyes when
I smelled my breath
And I saw the sky
But my feels dead

My body feels warm and save
I tried to scream
But my body hurt me
And I knew it was a dream

Is this the place
We will stay forever (and ever, and ever)
Or is it a dream I was waiting forever (and ever, and ever)
It feels so good and I never wish to wake up (never wish to wake up)

You were my hero, adore an altar I adorn with flowers
You were my god, my guilded picture of my fantasy
You were my hero but then I saw that you are just a human
You were my hero but now your altar bursting into flames

Forget your idols, believe in yourself, use your power to be free
Then my pictures decaying to dust, burning in the fire

You were my god, I am able to see that every fault is also yours
All the pictures blow with the wind, when I see clear
You were my god, my guilded picture of my fantasy
You were my hero but then I saw that you were just a human

Forget your idols, believe in yourself, use your power to be free
Then my pictures decaying to dust, burning in the fire

In the fire

Forget your idols, believe in yourself, use your power to be free
Then my pictures decaying to dust, burning in the fire

Forget your idols, believe in yourself, use your power to be free
Then my pictures decaying to dust, burning in the fire

Forget your idols, believe in yourself, use your power to be free
Then my pictures decaying to dust, burning in the fire

Have the courage and be yourself,
Forget your heroes, believe in yourself

Have the courage and be yourself,
Forget your heroes, believe in yourself

Find the right way that leads you to the end,
The end of this control
Until your soul is free
Right now!

When you are alone by yourself
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

And the light of the dawn,
And the shadow in your face,
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

And the light of the dawn,
And the shadow in your face,
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

Yeah it's got the feeling, and it's got the future, you hold your hands out
With nothing to give

Your mind and your body
Slave to a memory
And a quiet smile
'Til the moment is past

When you are alone by yourself,
Reach for the stars and you can touch them

You give all that you have,
To give a meaning,
You have nothing to hide,
To hide at all

Your mind and your body
Slave to a memory
And a quiet smile
'Til the moment is past

When you are alone by yourself,
Reach for the stars and you can touch them

And the light of the dawn,
And the shadow in your face,
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

You can see the stars

Regungslos, so liege ich, fremde Schatten rings um mich
Welcher Gott tat mir das an, bin ich tot, dass ich's ertragen kann?
Du stehst vor mir in weißem Licht, wer bist du, ich kenn' dich nicht?
Nimm mich auf und trage mich fort, an einen anderen Ort

Feuerengel führ' mich ins weiße Licht zu dir
Feuerengel lass' mich nicht brennen komm zu mir
Feuerengel ich liege hier und wart' auf dich
Feuerengel deine Flügel tragen mich
Feuerengel kalt das Gefühl, kalt dein Gesicht
Feuerengel in dir verbrenne ich

In the darkness
I keep you warm
In the coldest winter
I take you in my arms

I feel your warm skin
And I smell your breath
Before the dawn is coming up
I love you to death

In the darkness
I'm with you
Hold me now

In the darkness
Our world is painted blue
In deep dark colors
I love you

Hold me now

Hold me now
I'm covered in silence

I watch the stars
You turn out the light
I keep your warm hand and
We enjoy our night

I wish the time we spend
Will last forever
And the time that's left
We will be together

Wohin ich seh wohin ich geh
Seh ich Deinen Schatten neben mir
Als wärst Du ständig um mich rum
Meine Gedanken sind bei Dir

Bei Dir

Die Vergangenheit holt uns ein
Als würden wir niemals frei sein
Wie eine Reise ohne Ziel
Was ich verlange ist zuviel

Zuviel

Was bleibt ist chaos in meinem herz
In meinem kopf ein dumpfer schmerz
Und ein gefühl so endlos leer
So übermachtig endlos schwer

Was bleibt ist atmen ohne luft
Ist dein geruch ohne deinen duft
So wie ein raum ohne licht
Ohne dich schaff ich es nicht

Ohne dich schaff ich es nicht

Was bleibt ist chaos in meinem herz

Of peace and harmony
Relax and touch my skin
But close your eyes

Come here, don't walk away
Find yourself and stay
Trust me all night and day
You've got the key

You can reach my heart
And we fly away, touch me
I will break apart, you and me
We will be free, touch me

Come look into my soul
There is no chance to hide
The beauty of the end
Can you understand?

Don't try to hide your greed
And you will find much more
No life behind the wall
After the war

You can reach my heart
And we fly away, touch me
I will break apart, you and me
We will be free, touch me

I wish I was free now
You drive me into a place
Where I barely can hide from you
Moments at a time

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you?
I'm always turning around
To see you starring on my back

Sometimes I find that my
Delivery is all the same
And when I look at you
I instinctively start the game

I never see what you mean when you
Start to weep and scream at me
Oh no, the ringing in my head again!
Oh no, you're ripping off my face again!

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you?
I'm always turning around
To see you starring on my back

Why?

You're just a pretty face
You're just a pretty face

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you?
I'm always turning around
To see you starring on my back

Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Ah, look at all

Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came

Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks trom the grave
No one was saved

Slowly he settles down
To give them what they want
He tries to keep himself together

I would slam my head in the ground
Before I tell you this
He turns his head to the floor
As it falls away

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today

You tought me everything you know
The blame will surely show, yea
I tried to keep it down
Forever

The days have taken years
To conquer all my fears
I stand before you now
Sickened and cut down

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?

Standing in the back of the line
I feel the others try to push me
Down and keep it away from me
Grabbing at the one thing that I know is mine

Can't you see me with my head to the floor
Feel the recklessness of absolute desperation
Valued sentimental pieces of the life
I thought I held in my hands

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize
That I've always been sinking?

Failing everyday
It only helps to aggravate
The sickening feeling
Inside that won't go away

Fall down
Pick yourself up and fall down
Drink from my cup and fall down
This is what it's like to be me, me
Can't you see what I see?

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize
That I've always been sinking?

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize
That I've always been sinking?

What I am is what I feel
But what I feel is nothing real
And what I know is all I want
Is to be saved from this spot
Is to be saved from this spot
Is to be saved from this spot

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize
That I've always been sinking?

I want to be overcome
But I can't, I am numb
I want to see what's become
Close my eyes, bite my tongue

If you believe in me
I'll try not to die
If work keeps me living
It's got to start giving me life
Not just strife

I'm so tired of living here
I'm so tired of giving here

I'm so tired of living here

I want to run and be free
But I can't, I'm so weak, yea
I want to hold you again
In my arms, my old friend

I have just one more chance to feel
What is real
I can't keep on going
I feel my mind slowing
My heart's torn apart

I'm so tired of living here

See me dead before you, take my hand
I can make you understand
I have tried to help them, tried to speak
Wasted effort makes me weak

And I want a breakdown
So I can be unbound
I want to be anybody else right now

They'll use this against me, try to take
All the progress that I'd make
Don't you turn against me, try to run
Undo damage you have done

And I want a breakdown
So I can be unbound
I want to be anybody else right now

They don't try to break me
They just cut and rape me
I want to be anybody else right now

There's no fear of losing sleep
I'll never feel peace again in life

There's no turning back this time
It's too late to change my mind
I'm trapped in this box of paranoia

Close my blind eye
To what you've done to me
You've deconstructed me
So I will bleed your sickened life dry

I'm killing your world outside
The walls you have fortified
Are crumbling down with your self pride

I'm taking the words you've said
Repeating them in my head
Destroying your lies is my salvation

Close to you
And they held you from their ugly truth

Make you understand

Lies in front of you

When everything is gone and no one's left to carry on
Look through the ashes of what was to be
I wear the badge of the dispossessed and the label that I don't belong
I feel the stab in the dark and all that was mine is taken away

I am, I was
Everything you see
I am, I was
Never meant to be

When everything is bare and no one's left to ever care
Look for me at the end of all existence
I wear the brand of the insurrection that took a lifetime of pain to kill
I feel the stab in the dark and all that was mine is taken away

I am, I was

Don't know why
Down my spine

And what you steal
From what is real

A feeling like you're left behind
The door is closed and you're confined
To everyhing you've done
A thousand times

You're getting weaker every day
The room is filled with your dismay
It's getting harder to convey
Just what you're living with

Trapped alone
Burned out from the inside
Overthrown
By the lies of your self-pride

You kick your feet to run away
But all your effort goes astray
You feel as though you're made
Of clay and dirt

Now every bone is cracking in
You feel it underneath your skin
You wish you knew the origin
Of what I'm living with

Trapped alone
Burned out from the inside
Overthrown
By the lies of your self-pride

Terror is here, beyond your fear
A ghost of your memory
Desperate dreams can't intervene
The ghost of your memory

Trapped alone

Rip my last hope right out of me

Take the place of another
Cycle of delirium

I could turn myself into a miracle man
Bow before the things you hold sacred
Sparkling example of the one that you want
Leaving your existence mine to haunt

Don't you think this is unreal
You could be anyone
Take the place of another
End it all with a gun

I pray that everyday will be my last
Just give me away)

And it feels the same with anyone
And I know this has been overdone
Now it feels the same with everyone

Another life I'll never reach
Anything I want to

To bend the time
I pine away behind the mask
Of mandatory joy

Can't keep from running away

This is my destiny

I want to be like you
I want to live off the things that you always do
I want to be renewed
I want to know what it's like to be just like you

I wait in line
I walk the shallow empty halls
A terror in my mind waiting for you

I start to realize
That you're standing where
I should have been

Can't keep from falling apart

She cries herself to sleep
Feeling thing she's never known before
It tastes like rotten candy apples
It burns like all the lies she's never heard before

And all her dreams are shattered
On the floor again
And all her tries have failed
And lie among the dust

And all the time they spent apart
She hoped would make him see
That she was just the one for him
But he never looked inside himself

To find the empty heart of cold
That wraps around his soul of black
And buries him
In his grave of pain

And all her dreams are shattered
On the floor again
And all her tries have failed
And lie among the dust

He'll never understand
Why she cannot see the end
Of the world she made for them
And everything she grew to love

She'll never see inside
That he told her only lies
And convictions that he had
Just fell into an empty void

And all that really mattered
To make her whole again
Was broken outside
And never came in from the cold

Creeping up again
Lost myself and it's too late
Killing time again
Waiting for my only fate

Trapped within the cage
That I've built with my own hands
Can't release the rage
Shattered life and broken plans

If I knew myself
I wouldn't keep on doing this
But I trick myself
And believe with just one kiss

I can't believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

In the dark again
Afraid to move but can't sit still
Killed my heart again
To myself I give this pill

If I was myself
I'd find strength to push away
But I hurt myself
And I weaken more each day

I can't believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

As I come to know you
My disgust grows anew
As you tighten your grip
My worn throat slowly slits

I can't believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

I should just stop and let you know
But I'm afraid of letting go

Letting go

Album  Nothingness
Sifting through the ashes of my life
I thought I found the one that I could always trust
Slowly I began to learn that I can never judge
The things that mean the most to me

And all the hate and anger they all put on you
You just threw on me

And I don't believe that I could ever be with you
And I don't believe that we could ever be together

Calling out to you, try to show the truth
But you just carry on
Killing everything that we once had
And never really understanding why

And I don't believe that I could ever be with you
And I don't believe that we could ever be together

You've taken everything and left me here with nothing
Taken everything and left me here with nothing
You've taken everything and left me here with nothing
Taken everything and left me here with nothing

You've taken everything and left me here with nothing
Taken everything and left me here with nothing

And I don't believe that I could ever be with you
And I don't believe that we could ever be together

She waits patiently
Holding time for me
Tells me about herself

She writes everything
Up and down for me
Keeps it inside herself

As the deception reveals itself

My morality
A slave to gravity
My sanity has turned to agony

She hides me away
Can't speak or convey
Secrets about herself

She holds all the things
That keep her lingering
I take her inside myself

My morality
A slave to gravity
My sanity has turned to agony

I don't believe you when you say
That you don't know what you are
I try to understand why you
Are never happy?

You live your life in fantasy
And glass cathedrals
Why don't you come down from your cloud
And face reality?

I want, I love, I need, I breathe,
I lust, I trust, I cheat, I bleed

Behind the walls they built for you
You live your orchestrated life
Inside your heart you know it's wrong
But you can't stop it
Your soul it longs for something more
But never finds it
And so you blame me for it all
And choose another

I want, I love, I need, I breathe,
I lust, I trust, I cheat, I bleed

If your instinct's always right
How about I step aside?
And let you do your thing again

If there's nothing that can fool you
How come you're all alone?
Anything can happen now

When you close your little eyes
They will plunder all your dreams
And take away your teddy bear

I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time

Monkey see and monkey do
Now what a fool are you
To do just what they told you to?

And now you know how roles can change
You used to be so out of range
For anything that brought you down

Every time you go to sleep
You get to feel how this runs so deep
Makes nightmares out of pretty dreams

I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time

I just wish there was something
That you could say
That could make me care again

Something that would make me want to get you out of this
But there is really nothing left
Of anything we've had

So now you're on your own
So now you're all alone
Just like you always wanted it to be

No one to tell you how to think
No one to tell you when to stop
No one to tell you when to think about the fact that you fucked up

That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up

That you fucked up again

They're in control now and there's nothing you can do
They're in control now and there's nothing you can do
They're in control now and there's nothing you can do

They're in control now and there's nothing you can do
They're in control now and there's nothing you can do
They're in control now and there's nothing you can do

Prop me up and see my soul is aching
Take the dirt upon the ground around me
Bury me inside the grave I built for you

Walk into the room
Feel my stare of doom
Scars that line my face
Lies cannot replace

I can see through you
And I'll tell you

All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes

Kill you with my words
Get what you deserve

I can see through you
And I'll tell you

All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes

All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes

Remember what you did to me?
For you know I won't forget
Now you've broken everything
Is your heart filled with regret?

As I sit here
And slowly close my eyes
I take another deep breath
And feel the wind pass through my body

I'm the one in your soul
Reflecting inner light
Protect the ones who hold you
Cradling your inner child

I-I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know,
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold?
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing,
And when will we learn to control?

Tragic visions
Slowly stole my life
Tore away everything
Cheating me out of my time

I'm the one who loves you
No matter wrong or right
And every day I hold you
I hold you with my inner child

I-I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know,
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold?
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing,
And when will we learn to control?

Where do we go when we just don't know,
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold?
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing,
And when will we learn to control?

If it happened would it matter?
And I can't tell if I should go or stay
Same old picture feel so hollow

How can anybody know what's best for me?
Another page I turn in shame
And my decisions brought me to my knees
I needed someone to blame

I feel so hollow
I feel so hollow
Time to do what's best for me
I believe I can change

Once upon a time in broken dreams
Reflection's that I can't face
So hold your breath and make a wish for me
Take me to a better place

Time always seems to be passing by
It never waits for me
If I could do it all one more time
I wouldn't change a thing

Oh man, I'm tired and lonely

Again, why must it be
A man is drowning slowly
And he can't keep above
Gone way too deep, oh yeah

Open skies are falling,
Tears are coming down.
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around

One rainy day

Oh, so many times I should've crawled when I went running by
And since then I've been left feeling traumatized, yea

Raped and drained of an innocence
A gift we've lost over time
And still I gaze through this one rainy day
Alone with no one by my side

Open skies are falling,
Tears are coming down.
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around, yeah

I swear I've given,
I've given you all I can
Never will you ever make me feel this way again, oh
On this one rainy day

Hey, open skies are falling,
Tears are coming down.
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around

One rainy day
One rainy day
Oh one rainy day
It's been just one rainy day

Getting started really early,
got no time to hesitate
The stars are right to get to hell,
from the dog that bit me back
Break a nose or break a leg,
do you think that I give a damn?
I will never know it's over
I bring the bottom to the blind

There's no bottom when I run,
no tomorrow when I'm done
When you look into that hole,
you discover it destroys the soul
Got no time to die
There's no point to life

And if you judge me
and pointing fingers,
have a look at yourself

Bring me ... and some wine
I behave like a ... swine
... and maybe some booze,
please bring me my running shoes
A tambourine and loads of beer,
you don't wanna be around here
It is something, I had enough
I want more of that brown stone

There's no bottom when I run,
no tomorrow when I'm done
When you look into that hole,
you discover it destroys the soul
Got no time to die
Got no point to life

O-o-oh, a-a-ah
O-o-oh, a-a-ah
O-o-oh, a-a-ah
O-o-oh, a-a-ah

...
...
I've told you once, I've told you twice,
you can never change my life
... and play the blues,
... drinking the booze
But sometimes ...
that's when all hell breaks loose

There's no bottom when I run,
no tomorrow when I'm done
When you look into that hole,
you discover it destroys the soul
Got no time to die
Got no point to life

And if you judge me
and pointing fingers,

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?

Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you've lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

Don't want a nation under the new mania
Hey can you hear the sound of hysteria?

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well maybe I'm the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension

Wake me up when September ends

Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk alone

Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps addin' up, I think I'm crackin' up
Am I just paranoid, am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps

I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's still now feeling like my home and I'm never gonna go

'Cause you've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment, sleazing my backyard, so don't get
So uptight you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right

So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still-frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

Have you ever been for sale?
When your -isms get smart
Oh, so selfish and mindless
With that comment in your eye

Do you think that you are hard?
Really harder than the other
Man, you're acting cold
If you are not in charge

Don't split your mentality
Without thinking twice
Your voice has got no reason
Now is the time to face your lies

Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god, don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head

Will you offer me some tricks
If I ever need them?
Would you go into that room
If I call 'em

Do you think that you are better
Really better than the rest?
You realize there's a problem
I know that you can give your best

Have you ever had a dream
Or is life just a trip?
A trip without chances
A chance to grow up quick

Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god, don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head

Hide your face forever
Dream and search forever
Night and night, you feel nothing
There's no way outside of my land

Save all your prayers
I think we lost today
There's no morning after
And no one's around to blame

I'm not afraid to bleed
But I won't do it for you
A star among hypocrites
The melody of our time

So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the earth

Scream your lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
Here's the next disaster!

What decides when you've lost the war?
When the first man falls?
Or when they've erased it all?

We're too numb to feel
The downfall starts right here
Hold your breath and swim
Swallowed by life's tears

In times of make believe
No one really seems to care
Maybe I should care less
'cause I'll die too

So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the earth

Scream your lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
Here's the next disaster!

What will it take for us to realize
The more we provoke
Winter will come twice

Compassion, confession
Resolve and compromise
Dedication, domination
Please define the lines

Mutation innovation
Paired-up to succeed
Retaliation termination
Six lives and greed

Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can
I'm trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma

Agression, attention
A need to be seen
Gyrated disrespected
Stand in line
To be centre of scene

Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can
I'm trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma

Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can
I'm trying to hold on
To what I believe in

Shot for shot
Let the bullets penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of golden gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I've built
Your eyes reach deep in me

Take a chance
They don't come
Much bigger than this
A Dark Star
Spend another day with me
A dead surface
That doesn't reflect
The storm underneath
Take a chance
Bring me the calm

When there's nothing
Expose the dark side
Aching and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

Throw yourself
Into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me
Sneak out before I awake
Take out the trash
And burn it
Try to find a beautiful
Place to lay
These fragile bones of mine

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me


When there's nothing
Expose the dark side
Aching and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

We are ordinary people
We all exist with life
In the end we pray
Don't let them see
We're just living different lies
We're just living different lies

I say scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you
They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

We're ordinary people
Mortal realms?

Say scream, you scream

But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior

Name  Scream
Artist  In Flames

It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And meet the fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought, whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand
You're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

The raindrops just beg to hit me
What now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide-and-seek
I call on you to take me on

Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn my efforts
In the end, it means nothing

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought, whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand
You're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

These thoughts
Burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts
Will keep me feeling

These thoughts
Burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts
Will keep me feeling

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought, whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand
You're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

The yesterday we loved
Speak of tomorrow
The burden of man is that
Time never takes a pause
We live from Monday to Sunday
But we forget what it means
Then a ghost comes to visit and
We tell stories from tabloids

Call all your friends
Watch fake photos
From a made up vacations
Speaking in tongues
About ancient artefacts

We steal from beggars
And ask for understanding
Lie, rape, steal and murder
To make tonight's headlines

Trust the system
Make your contribution
Smile, applaud, love, hail
The weaker you get
The stronger they become

Listen in silence
Hear her voice
How far are we ready to take this?
Listen in silence
Hear her voice
Before it all crumbles

Lie, rape, steal and murder
Smile, applaud, love, hail

Gather in front of the TV
Exploding sympathy
The weatherman, our trust
Our punctual company

We steal from beggars
And ask for understanding
Lie, rape, steal and murder
To make tonight's headlines

Trust the system
Make your contribution
Smile, applaud, love, hail
The weaker you get the
Stronger they become

Beyond getting them in lines
Learn to survive
A fine way to
Make friends and a place to call home

Take a picture and
Jump before we crash
Take a picture and
Jump before we crash

We'll slide away and
Learn your ways
We'll fire when ready
This is the race
To no mans land
But in no set direction

You're on the easy route
Money a front, theres no doubt

When all the lights go out
We know what that's about

When all that's left is lies
There'll be nothing

They know they left its lies

I don't see you make any sense
I guess you deliver misery
Just like you should

9 o'clock
And you paint the skies grey
It's not your fault
We're the ones who betray
But how can you say it with such ease?
You want to take a stand or just please?

Your bedtime story is scaring everyone
But you make me understand the evil that men do
The evil that men do

You want someone to blame
The one who drives the rusted nail
But who's left will never care
Pretending becomes a chore
All you search for, a little piece of mind
Too far, too deep, the two faced smile
So lost, you feel, I know

Wide awake but still asleep
Always a stranger in a crowd (Sleep, sleep, sleep)
Wide awake, always a stranger in a crowd (Wake, wake, wake)

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
I'm there until the end of time

Leave the doomed behind
Search with different light
You were trying to remember
But it's all make believe

You are, you are, you are

Wide awake but still asleep (Wide awake but still asleep)
Always a stranger in a crowd

Throw it all away
Until we are erased
But it doesn't mean a thing

And I can't remember
What the skies looked like
Will I find out
That I'm late for salvation?

What if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again

Gravity takes control
Don't forsake my troubled times
I'm starting to regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again

I will be reborn

I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will
I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will

Throw it all away
Afraid I will drift on the open sea
I regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time

Fearless and whole
Find out what you are
Back in time

No

I need this
Truth is...

Once you had enough
Break out
Room to breathe
To love
Before you're gone

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
Everything's gone

Where I have nothing
There's no hate
Room to breathe
No envy and nothing to lose

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
Everything's gone

Break out

All for one, one for none

When it's time
You know this could never be justified
But still you take the hatred home

Or is this what you were searching for?
The wounded and its filtered truth
Don't ignore a life that's real

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

You're battered against the world, you knew
A place to hide from everything
And it had to make you fall

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?

My heads all wired
In plain view
There's nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny
But just a little spark and once again... I don't know

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear

Are we the only ones?
It's all dark in here
Do I just waste my time?
Searching for exits in infinite space

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

All the lights
All the lights
Is that the future or another lullaby?

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Tormented minds they wander
Drifting away from the light
I will lift you up my friend
You have to learn to breathe again

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Unlock the secrets
Let us find the memories
Find ourselves some ruins
Turn them into something

You are lost within
Fading out
A world that threw you away

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom

Breeding the hate

Turn away
Run away
From all the things we have to do

And it tears away our hearts and our soul

It's like we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
Rewind
There's no time
The wasteland.... It's an indication

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

That we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed

We have found the wasteland

These wrong ways are mine
But the whole world can just go to hell
This life is killing me
My feelings inside I can't explain
I'm awake, but not for long

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

I gave you the story of my life
Some of my precious time
But I'm tired of this
With every promise of eternal light
Another feeling dies

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

To do this we part our ways

My destination, my mission, my intuition
so close I feel it changing me
Suddenly I know, I have to let it go

All that's been lost, all that's been won
Now I feel right before me
Intentions are pure, I'm out of reach

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe
And I have wings (I have)
Nothing and everything at the same time
Oh, a brighter sun

Save me from my fears
And darkest thought of her
Carry me through times
Through oblivion

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me

Life's a matter of moments
Face the truth
That I cannot run

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know, dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine
Come lay with me

We're walking backwards

But life's a selfish thing
Like broken promises

A thousand times
Try to fake it
Just another liar

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

How come we walk a mile
Just to shatter what we love?
Eyes wide open
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
Saying - You know you are heading -

The lost dream
Of what could have been
It makes no difference

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again

I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Feel a sudden haze
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions

It will never be the same
It's not straight but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

All the while,
I don't need another friend

I burn when I do the things I do for you

I'm sure that one day
I can get you all that you lost

Blessed is the sick in me
I'm dying alone
We stand to fight for nothing
Without a thought, a reason
It will never be okay

I burn when I do the things I do for you

September's here again
Every insecurity reminds you
Who's at the helm?
Darker times
With fear in the eyes
Who's the man in charge?

Invented isolation
Alone and safe inside
Struggle with words
That make sense in time
Yet waiting for someone to enter

Say,
I have a better plan
I have a better plan
I have a better plan

Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It's fine we're living the lie

When light breaks
Another way to matter
All questions somehow answered
When life comes crushing
At the early break of day
We've only come so far

Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It's fine we're living the lie

(Never have to worry for all that we know)

You take everything in sight, please hear me now
You, you are leaving me with scars

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We're losing identity
Faith has been denied let's not pretend
This is the first time we just don't belong

What world do you perceive?
All turn cold, no one cares for anyone
Waiting for a final blow
Do you have strength at all?
One more day then we fade away

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go

Doesn't mean the world will fall into place

Took some time but now you know
Tomorrow is too late

I have to see those who don't know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

If today was your last day
Would that change a thing?

Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

How much can we take before we care to settle?
Thought we were set for a perfect scene
Everyone is waiting for a failure
Something I can please and justify
The void within our lives
Everyone is waiting for something they cannot have

Why don't you drop your guard
I'm on my knees
You got the mindset of a killer
And it will not take you far
If I had the answer would that make you stay?
This is the time and place it is your moment of fate

If this would be your last breath
Would it change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying

What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?

If I had the answer
Would that make you stay
This is the time and place
You are waiting for something you cannot have

If this would be your last breath
Would it change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me, believe me, I'm trying

You can find all you need
The message is in the silence
Whisper words to calm your mind
Reach inside
Numb the pain
Come around with answers

We are ghosts of a concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

Staring into bright lights
I am what I've done
It's useless to hide
An empty chamber
Guess I was part of a plan

We are ghosts of a concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

We're running out of time
Can't seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place
Counting down the days
Beginning of the end

We are ghosts of a concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
We are ghosts of a concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?

There is someone in the attic
Building a strange machine
Never really seen him
But I think he works all day

Blinded by the world outside
I stay inside
Hardly know my name
But it's getting better by time

I saw something in the mirror
Someone's watching me
If I hide in the attic
He will never get to me

I found some rope on the floor
I have to build a trap
So I started on my machine
I'm never to be seen

And I tried to think
Tried to paint the picture
I lived it all
Wouldn't have to feel this way

(Looking for something to believe in)
Looking for something to believe in
I think I've done my time
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light

Keep pretending
I can handle everything
You'll never understand me
And I don't care what you think
Or maybe I do?

Fading away from here
I'm fading away from here
I'm fading away from here

We're fading away from here

I'm fading away from here, can't see nothing here.
Even though I'm awake, my body slowly breaks.
Feels so cold that I shake, every time I reflect.
These stories I'm writing to verse they sure do serve my thirst.
Seems to clear my head, when I'm awake at night.
I pull myself so tight, lying in the dark.
Feeling rich with words,
I'm about to draw my thoughts, re planning out my chords.
I'll start it all from scratch.

Take me away, shattered my hopes today.
Nothing kept me on my seat.
Oh it ends so tragically for me.

Take me away....

Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marching in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready, are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance that whole defense
Spinning infinity, but the wheel is spinning me
It's never ending, never ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender

In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender

I'm the voice inside your head, you refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face, mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees

So, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

What if I say that I'll never surrender

Take it to your top and now watch me get in
Feel the sun is up and now let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
feel me get in
(oh man)
feel me get in
(oh yeah)

Take me up and out
Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had more time for, you...

The three-dimensional professional projections of spectral light
Connected room, selection air-tight
The isolated, the decisive, victory stimulated
The non-simulated patterns of flight originated
Now I'm a carnivore on a tour of duty
My band of brothers in full metal jackets establish cruelty
Black magic conjurer, attack through the monitor
Destruction of assumption, one thing I can promise ya

Impact, crash, with cold shards of glass
Ritualistic annihilators -- murder your cast
The future from the past, that last that feel
The seventh seal broken in half, ceremony is real

Become obsolete, high-strung from a beat
A strong minded individual delivering defeat
Blood rivers in the street, keep flowing no retreat
Deep omens keep opponents speech limited repeat

You're opening the door to the corridor stretching to the left
There's hunger in my eyes, but the truth is on my chest
I am just a man who wants revenge, and I confess
I am full of rage and sin
Locked inside this cage again
When evil reigns 'cause people like to win
It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end
So we shine brightly from the light within

You're opening the doors to the corridors stretching to the left
Anger within my eyes, but the truth is on my chest

It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end

Turn the music up a bit...

Yo, yo...
Dark secrets, demons with a conscience
I'm the Lone Ranger looking for Pocahontas
Teenage zombies flying the beat
I'm dying to learn what I'm trying to be
Go Bad News Bears and the Dukes of Hazzard
The youth of my group is the truth, so have it
Keep myself couped up, recoup quickly
Face still hurts but my kids stick with me
Death loved not far as we go
Crazy face, still not star of the show
I appreciate the chance truth hurts, I'll kill you
Ice pick into your neck, I will do (Anything)
Talk to you like I might care (Anything)
Rippled by the nightmare, moonshine distillery
Back road to villiany
Military star, I depart with artillery

Why can't I see what's in front of me?
Why can't I see what's in front of me?

I see the doors that I can't open
Adding locks from time to time
When it opens something blocks me
And I'm asking myself why?
Did I take the step I wanted
Was it just a state of mind?
I feel sorry for myself
Every time I close my eyes

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...

Why can't I see what's in front of me?
Why can't I see what's in front of me?

What's behind the door I wonder?
Must be brighter than my past
Will I feel a little different
When I take myself across?
Was it really worth the journey?
Was it just a foolish task?
I feel sorry for myself
When I open up my eyes...

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more....

Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burns with no regret
I vow to play the part

In this a meeting of the soul
My feelings are unknown
I learn with no regret
I'm getting what I get

Feel some pain though I'm miles away
And ring to let you know
Are you seeing someone?
I'd better let you go

She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn

Honesty eludes one and all
Like some gypsy's search for gold
He's dreaming all the time
But the gold is hard to find

Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burns with no regret
I'm getting what I get

Made a mistake with myself
My lover couldn't lie
She told me of the things
That made her cry inside

She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn

Having the dreams of some gypsy

Well you know just what you do to me
The way you move soft and slippery
Cut the night just like a razor
Rarely talk and that's the danger

It's the one thing
You are my thing

You know your voice is a love song
It's a cat call from the past
There's no ice in your lovers walk
You don't look twice 'cause you move so fast

It's the one thing
You are my thing

You've got a dozen men behind you
You've got dead flowers on the floor
You're too pretty in the daylight
It keeps them coming back for more

It's the one thing
You are my thing

It's the one thing
You are my thing

It's the one thing
You are my thing

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

Who do you ask when there's no one
Left to turn to
You ask me and I'll always try to hear
Past money and colors and make believe
Good cheap values for a thrifty clown

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good

What is the name to call

What do you fear in the simple
Still of a summer's night?
I understand I sympathize for a day dream
Fairytailes and I love you

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

Dying swans, twisted wings
Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life
In this garden of fear
I have seen many things
In a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more
Bring this savage back home

Wilderness house of pain
Makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain
Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real
Those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls
To this brave new world

A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world

In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world

Dragon kings, dying queens
Where is salvation now
Lost my life, lost my dreams
Rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here
Dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned
In this brand new world

A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world

In a brave new world
A brave new world

In a brave new world
A brave new world

Dying swans, twisted wings
Bring this savage back home

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way have I dreamt this time this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face seen this room been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't take no more

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

I get up put on the light dreading the on coming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away myself from drifting saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning lost a nightmare I retrace

Lost a hell that I revisit lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Ohh oo oo ohh
Ohh oo oo ohh
Ohh oo oo ohh

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

I have sailed to many lands now I make my final journey
On the bow i stand, west is where i go
Through the night i plough still my heart calculate and pray
As the compass swings my will is strong
I will not be led astray

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know
I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know
I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Withered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live

Out of the silent planet, dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise, no more second chances
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late
Before you know the crime it's all too late

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Azazel is besides you and he's playing a game
Demons are inside you and they are making a play
Watching and their hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready to take over your mind

You and only God will know what can be done
You and only God will know I am the only one
You and only God will know what can be done
You and only God will know I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all of my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and he's coming my way
It's an honor to be chosen and i wait for the day

Could it be it's the end of our world
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all of my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted which are you
Diablo comes again
To make trophies out of men

Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright

Toe to toe throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will Iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
you're the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend your own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some they say that you have killed a hundred man
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost
At what price a life is lost

At what point do we begin
Fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a gray place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame
On society these days
But what kind of good or bad
A new generation brings

Sometimes take just more than that
To survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

Just a few small tears between
Someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between
Being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn
Of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road
And the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a gray place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue was frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a new born in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

The ferryman wants his money you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a new born in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
And You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

Sie hört am liebsten Wu-Tang
Modelt für Bikinis
Auf Kuba baut sie Brunnen

Let go of the burden that keeps you looking back

What's the reasons for that..
Let go of the burden that keeps you
looking back at the tracks that you made as you fell.
What's the reasons for that
if we will never try to stand again.

Two summers passed but the winters didn't.
You moved but you keep coming back.
This place kept us both down and you knew that.
But you,
you took the first breath
as we reached the surface.
You took the first breath.

Two summers passed but the winters didn't.
They remained within us like monuments of the words we never said.
But you,
you took the first breath
as we reached the surface.
You took the first breath.
And i,
i told you my secrets.
There will be no more cold.
You took the first breath,
now will you let go.

You tried to find home and it's in your hands now.
You tried and it's far from what slipped through,
slipped through ours.
Wasn't this what you asked for.
You tried to find home and it's in your hands now.

So shouldn't you
let go of the burden that keeps you looking back at the tracks
that you made as you fell.
What's the reasons for that
if we will never try to stand again.

You moved but you keep coming back.

I tried to see you
Through broken glass
Prepare to warn you
Nothing will last

I don't want you
You make me crazy
Cannot have you
You make me crazy

Trust in something
To be let down
I've gathered my fears
Just as I hit the ground

I don't want you
You make me crazy
Cannot have you
You make me crazy

Oh!

So much pain inside
My head begins to explode
I'm lost without reason
Grown cold

You're lost forever
Etched in my mind
Streams of pressure
Leave me so unkind

I don't want you
You make me crazy
Cannot have you
You make me crazy

Oh!

So much pain inside
My head begins to explode
I'm lost without reason
Grown cold

You've taken all that's good in me
Now I've taken back, but you sit in hell

You threw me with your cue face down
Come around like nothing have happened

Jump
It's all the same

Back down
It's all the same

Back down
It's all the same

Original text by  Jerkstore
Okay, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga…"
Again, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
Never had shit, never take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga
Give me everything…"

Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with, haven't came up
And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinking that they fucking with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
"Oh, my God, don't be mean to me"
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in the way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s

Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
Never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…"

Uhh, let's go

Yeah… yeah, yeah, what, um
Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan something
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful

And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying, "Come and see"
And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There will be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

'Til Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast the golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked and behold, a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him

I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
I started to keep going
But something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in
And I give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been it's been awhile
She was glad to see me
I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said it's not to late to start again
We could spend a night together
Take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot

Then I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes I'm in need of something
But it's something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said good-bye
She just left me standing in there, I never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot

We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson ...

...ever since the fire went out.
I'm goin' to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around,
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson,
Look out Jackson town.

Well, go on down to Jackson; go ahead and wreck your health.
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself,
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair!

Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson.

See if I care.

When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow. (Hah!)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how,
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loosen my coat.
'Cos I'm goin' to Jackson.

"Goodbye," that's all she wrote.

But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg.
They'll lead you 'round town like a scalded hound,
With your tail tucked between your legs,
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man.
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Jaypan Fan.

Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out.
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact.
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back.

Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout ...

Album  The Greatest: Duets
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear
You are someone else, I am still right here

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down,  I will make you hurt

If I could start again, a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way

So you've come a long way
But you're never out late
Never had plans for a normal life
It's quiet, too busy earnin'
You can't get enough

Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough

And I get it always
But I bet it won't change, no
Damn, that's a boring life
It's quite busy earnin'
You can't get enough

Just busy earnin'

You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his

You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money

She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money (money...money)
If you ain't no punk

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries

So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this nine is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

"All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours"

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches (Okay, okay)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga it's go time

I roll in dough with a good grind and I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet, they say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch

She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

"All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours"

Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it"

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most till someone said to me

"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Aw man (Sherane)
Where is she taking me?
Where is she taking me?

All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
(That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't trippin')
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in 's lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
(And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too)
Wait hold up, ay I see somebody

Aha, got them niggas, K-dot, you good?

You might be bigger, but I'm much smarter
My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller

What don't kill you lets you live
To remember what it did
I'm a bit relieved you're still the same
'Cause there's no illusion you've changed

Now it's all over
I see now, I'm a veteran of things I don't want to be

And the more I learn, the less I know
And the deeper it feels, the less it shows
There was a time and a day when
I didn't think I would be here

But now, it's all over
I see now, I'm a veteran of things I don't want to be
I've been down, and it's over

This happens all the time, it's detachable

(Detachable penis)

This comes in handy a lot of the time
I can leave it home
get me in trouble
Or I can rent it out when I don't need it

But now and then I go to a party,
Get drunk, and the next morning
I can't, for the life of me,
Remember what I did with it

First I looked around my apartment
And I couldn't find it
So I called up where the party was
They hadn't seen it either
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet
'Cause, for some reason I leave it there sometimes
But, not this time
So I told them if it pops up to let me know

I called a few people who were at the party
But they were of no help either
I was starting to get desperate
I really don't like being without my penis for too long
Make me feel like less of a man
And, I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak

After a few hours searching the house,
Calling everyone I could think of,
I was starting to get very depressed, so
I went to the kia and ate breakfast

Then as I walked down the 2nd Avenue
Towards St. Marks place
Where all those people sell XXX
And other junk on the street

I saw my penis lying on a blanket
Next to a broken toaster oven
Some guy was selling it
I had to buy it off him
He wanted 22 bucks
But I talked him down to 17
I took it home, washed it off
And put it back on
I was happy again, complete

People sometimes tell me
I should get it permanently attached,
But, I dunno...
Even if sometimes it's a pain in the ass
I like having a detachable penis

(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)

Stranded in the spooky town
Stoplights are swaying and the phone lines are down
The floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eye
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
The skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

Now it's coming closer
Now it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded, all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now, baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing, taking its toll

Now it's coming closer
Now it's coming closer
Now it's coming closer
Now it's coming closer

Isolation
When you leave it's like I disappear
Desolation
Every time you go it feels like
Seconds slowly turn to minutes
A month of Sundays coming up
Time again it pulls me under
Wonder if I'll ever rise above
It's too much but not enough

Misery loves company
For a little bit of sympathy

It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today

Desperation
Sinking into somewhere dark and cold
Deviation
A place I knew I didn't wanna go
To forget is all I know

Misery loves company
For a little bit of sympathy

It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today

Minutes slowly turn to hours
Another moment passes by
Seconds of eternity
I wonder if it's time to say goodbye

It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today

I am your holy totem
I am your sick taboo
Radical and radiant
I'm your nightmare coming true

I am your worst enemy
I am your dearest friend
Malignantly malevolent
I am of divine descent

I am your apocalypse
I am your belief unwrought
Monolithic juggernaut
I'm the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
From the barrel of love
Stray bullet
From the heavens above
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I'm the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I'm the illegitimate son of God

I have come to rock your world
I have come to shake your faith
Anathematic anarchist
I have come to take my place

I am your apocalypse
I am your belief unwrought
Monolithic juggernaut
I'm the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
From the barrel of love
Stray bullet
From the heavens above
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I'm the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I'm the illegitimate son of God

(Even if God really existed)
(It would be necessary to abolish him!)

I am your unconsciousness
I am unrestrained excess
Metamorphic restlessness
I'm your unexpectedness

Stray bullet
(From the barrel of love)
Stray bullet
(From the heavens above)
Stray bullet
(Ready or not)
(I'm the illegitimate son of God)

Come now, surely we can be friends
I know so much about you
I love you
Look at everything I've done for you
You'd be nothing without me

Why don't you answer me?
I bet you're busy talking to some fucking slut
Fucking skank... is she hotter than me?
Would you fuck me?
Are you gay?

Giant tropical centipedes share their territories with tarantulas.

Despite its impressive length, it's a nimble navigator, and some can be highly venomous.

As quick as lightning, just like the tarantula it's killing, the centipede has two curved hollow fangs which inject paralyzing venom.

Even tarantulas aren't immune from an ambush.

This centipede is a predator.

Endless summer days
That I spent with you
Under the light and shades
Eons old and new
Watchin' the sun go down in the deepest blue
Far in the distance sounds, only waves come through

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We're endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
In the deepest blue
In the deepest blue

Endless summer days
That I spent with you
Into the salty haze
Of our wildest youth
Watchin' the sun go down in the deepest blue
Far in the distance sounds, only waves come through

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We're endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
In the deepest blue
In the deepest blue

Swimming in the deepest
Swimming in the deepest
We're in the deepest blue

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We're endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
An endless
An endless

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
Tell it on the radio
We're in the deepest blue

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and
Even in the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud
The eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind
The sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings
Create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land
Feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time
A thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears
We stand surrounded by a million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you
