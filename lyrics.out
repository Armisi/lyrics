I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all, I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head,
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

Oh, no-no-no-no-no

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite, yea!

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

Oh, whoa-whoa
Oh, whoa-whoa
Oh, whoa-whoa...

What'd you expect from me?
It's not my fault you'll never be happy
Just 'cause you're right doesn't mean I'm wrong
Our days were numbered and we knew it all along
Can't you let things be?
Now all that's left is misunderstandings
Spent my nights wishing I was gone
My dad was right, we will never get along

So I'm done, 'cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence, oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me

Can't you act your age?
Is it that hard to say what you're thinking?
Lately my life's moving way too fast
You'd drag me down if I'd let you hold me back
What a mess you've made
And you hide from it at the bars you frequent
Blamed myself avoiding time this cost
But looking back you only learn from what you lost

So I'm done, cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence, oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe you got the best of me

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
(Oh-oh oh-oh)
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time
(Ye-yeah)

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
(Oh-oh oh-oh)
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time
(Ye-yeah)

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said

Fuck ya!

Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream
Well it still is, and I never wanna wake
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face

That was then, this is now
Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now
We never questioned it, was more like when and how

That was then, this is now
Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Ya!

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from

This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same

Let me find the way that I can make do
Without circumstance, without follow through
A man in desperation can't trust a troubled mind
I'm building an empire, say I'm wrong
I don't mind if it's all against one
No room for weakness, I'll be gone forever

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck
I'm reflecting on these past few years I spent trying to forget
I'm regretting all this time spent half the world away
What will the children sing, what will the children sing
When I'm dead and buried?
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried

I can't fight it
I can't fight it
I can't fight it
I've slipped through the cracks

I hold nothing back

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck
I'm reflecting on these past few years I spent trying to forget
I'm regretting all this time spent half the world away

Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried

Never thought it'd be easy, 'cause it's not if it's worth to have
It'll pass you by, you have a choice, be your own person, have your own voice

So let's set it off!

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck

I took some time away for understanding
Of what brought us here today
Oh, you'll be the end of me
I'm never happy like we were happy
I'm never sad like we were sad
Oh, you'll be the end of me

You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause oh, you'll be the end of me

I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying
Till I forgot why I stayed
Oh, you'll be the end of me
Yeah, we lost all meanin', we lost the magic
So good luck to you on your way
Oh, you'll be the end of me

You know me all too well

I get it, no, I get it
Gave more than I took back, oh well (So back away)
I get it, no, I get it
Can't help those who don't wanna be helped

You know me all too well

Hello, you don't seem like yourself
At least from what I knew, you're somebody else
Oh no, it's so much harder to take
It took me four years to realize you're a fake
But I won't lie, I'd forfeit all the rest of my time to patch things up
Just to take back what you stole of mine

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

You know, I grew so tired of the games you consistently played, where I took all the blame
It's true, you're just unhappy with you
You drink every night, so you can't think things through
And I, I tried, to give you peace of mind
One day you'll wake up, and realize what's passed you by

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

Good things don't end, they end badly
You got a lot of nerve, and I'm not catching up
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

You say it's over? I say, what's the rush?
No matter what, it's never enough
You don't care, I knew you never cared

You say it's over? I say, what's the rush?
No matter what, it's never enough
I don't care, you know that I ain't scared.

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out
(You had a good thing, you lost a good thing)

Good things don't end, they end badly
You got a lot of nerve, and I'm not catching up
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

Good things don't end, they end badly

I'd never wish any of this on anyone or anything.
Aw come on, you gotta try and look at things like me.
I never needed anything I got,
I never keep anything I have, what do I have?
Mostly things that'll never last.

Then I think back...

I remember when I first saw the country.
I remember sleeping in the van.
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand.
I remember jumping off of cliff tops.
I remember playing with no one there.
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been.
Cause where I've been.

They wonder why I hide myself from everyone,
from everything, man come on.
You wouldn't last a day as me.
Everyone loves me for my past, but they always hate me in the present.
Why can't you just meet me somewhere in the middle?

It's in the hardest times we grow the most.

I remember when I first saw the country.
I remember sleeping in the van.
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand.
I remember jumping off of cliff tops.
I remember playing with no one there.
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been.
Cause where I've been.

Speeding up, to slow down.
Side glances around this crowd all at me.
There must be something I can't see, so tell me.
Hold me up, help me out.
As I circle around what makes me happy.
There isn't one place that I can be without leaving.
This is my life.

I remember when I first saw the country.
I remember sleeping in the van.
Said goodbye to friends and family, they could never understand.
They don't understand.
They don't understand.

I remember jumping off of cliff tops.
I remember playing with no one there.
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am.
I remember the coast of California.
I remember trucks stops cross the land.
Never kept too many idols cause we were busy being them.
I remember waking up in Georgia. I remember quitting my last job.
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I was, where I've been.
Cause where I've been.

You've got secrets, oh yeah,
And I've got a weakness for them.
No this ain't the time or place to show your face,
Cause you know that I can't stand
The need to get even. Tonight,
When everything ya say won't come out right.
So I'll try to save some face, and take my space
Till the times right, cause we'll need it.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember? The truth,
Cause they won't even want me to.

Wish you would read this, oh yeah,
And knew that I mean it. I did.
Yeah I could fill every page with all my ways
That I tried to understand.
Wished things could be different. Alright,
Well it ain't for the lack of how I tried.
So let's go our separate ways, and count the days
As we get by. Cause we'll get by.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.

Cause they won't even want me to.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.

Where I'm the only one who's wrong.
It's always something, it's always something
With me and you.


So I surrender

They won't even want me to (I, I surrender)

As I look 'round this makeshift moving house
I'm searching for whatever's left of me
It's on the ground in a box that reads lost and found
It's lost and found

She said, just let it go
She said, it's all you've ever known

And I'm, I'm already gone
I'm already something to someone
That I don't know
When will I know?

And I'm, I'm out making rounds
On every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

I've worked it out, you'll always bring me down
From here on out, I'm doing things for me
I'm impatient now, I'm not the type for life alone
I need someone

She said, just let it go
And she said, it's all you've ever known

And I'm, I'm already gone

And I'm, I'm out making rounds
On every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

With everything that sets me back
I push back harder to clear the way
There's not a thing that I regret
Can't live my life in yesterday

With everything that sets me back

Guess things didn't go the way that you planned
I missed the days when you would understand
The way that I am
You have me feeling lonely and detached
Every time I'm moving forward
We take two steps back
I need to have a moment to myself
County lines, clear my mind with someplace else
Besides this stairwell
Alone and on the road, I'm overwhelmed
I need to find the difference in how I feel and how I felt

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone
Leave all the lights on

I wish I could get back to the way things were
When we were young, having fun, so self assured
But now that's all a blur
I miss the way we always used to talk
Now we talk ourselves in circle till we forget why we fought

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone
Leave all the lights on
If I'm not worth letting go
Leave all the lights on
If you still care I need to know
Leave all the lights on

This gets me so down down down
Why can't we work it out, can't we work it out?
This makes me so down down down
I've been trying to see, if you were meant for me
You get me so down down down, I'm gonna turn this car around
Just know that it's the last time
Ya it's the last time.

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone (Down, down, down)
Leave all the lights on,
If I'm not worth letting go
Leave all the lights on, if you still cared I need to know (Down, down, down)
Leave all the lights on

Guess things didn't go the way that you planned

When the curtain falls it rolls, unwraps, reminds me
The person that I am
I'm still afraid, ashamed, of what's behind me
But you gave me the strength to stand

Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)
Just sh-sh-shake it off, and no one will ever know (won't know)

I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave

Sometimes when no one's left to listen I'll sit and argue with myself
Say all the things I wish to tell you, without hurting someone else
Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want

I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid they'll walk with me until my end

Hey you, when'd ya get so cold? (When'd ya get so cold?)
Hey you, just do what you're told, do what you're told
Hey you, you're gonna be a star
As long as you'll let us we'll make you the person that you aren't

Life lessons learned the hard way.

Four people waited in a random white unmarked van.
Parked outside your hotel high rise garage.
To use a tire iron to break the bones inside your legs.
Too bad you never came outside, that's all right,
'Cause in the end you'll get wrecked.
Yeah, in the end, you'll get wrecked.

I heard a little girl killed herself today, that blood's on your hands.
It's on your hands, when everyone knows your face, nothing's safe.
You'll live your life as a fucking target.

You've earned my disgust.

We're coming out swinging!

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn't do
Don't want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes and every local bar
Played a show a night till it'd make me sick

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey! (Hey)!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"

We left home with no kinda back up plan
And everyone we knew that we couldn't stand
Said if you can't make it here, you won't make it there
Don't want to hear about it
Spent most of our time sleeping on hard wood floors
People's living rooms in any open door
We played a show a night till it all made sense

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey! (Hey)!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it yet

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said

I've lost a part of me
Cause I am just an open book for everyone to see
I always leave empty handed
I can't keep the things that mean the most to me
I'm walking steady on a tightrope
Clinging only to the words that I wrote
I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face?
I've always wanted to know
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it, I don't get it
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough
And that's alright with me
You take me for granted
I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
And those that are weak at the seams
You weren't worth my time
You weren't worth my time
But still I let you take it from me

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face?
I've always wanted to know
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it, I don't get it
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

Why do I always do this to myself?
Always depending on everyone else
You know it's gonna drive me crazy
You're just a notch in the wall that made me
Why do I always do this to myself?

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
Go get carried away

Go!

And the fears sets in, in an instant
Too much of myself gets exposed
This is where I go at my weakest
When I don't have to be scared to tell the truth

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong
That's why sad songs make me happy, 'cause I don't have to feel alone

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

It's never what you've done, it's what you've done lately
Who cares what you're saying, if no one's listening
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt
To those left in sadness I'll be the one to lead you out

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me

You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don't make me who I am

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don't make me who I am

God help those who help themselves, and forget about everyone else
You lost your nerve, you missed the point
God help those with open hands, may they never feel burden again
Yeah I'll stand up for those who can't
I'll close the distance

You're all about you, and it's my fast track to an early grave.
Just need to see this through
Do you even sleep at night?
Where does your conscience run to hide?

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can't you just do what's right by me?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It can't get much harder, harder to breathe.

The room keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep.
Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me.
Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight.

How's living a lie?
You never could face me,
And you hide behind fake personalities
Because deep down you're scared.
So weak beyond compare.

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can't we just go our separate ways?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It won't be much farther, I'm counting the days.

Even when your worst surrounds me, you'll never get the best of us.

Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

No fucking respect.

All hail the thief forever trying to separate you and me.
All hail the thief forever trying to separate
No fucking respect.

I've been feeling like everything is for nothing
In fact I've never felt so goddamn small
Always searching for the bright side to find the strength for when I fall
I'm still believing that life has a meaning
Cant cope with thinking that there's not
I'm so divided that I try to hide it
It's the only real thing that I've got!

So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
Somethings gotta give

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You can call this a warning
It's a warning that were drowning in our malcontent
Tear me down like a cancer, whats your answer?
We're different and it makes you sick
There is a sadness here, on every corner
It's in our hearts dear God
Don't wanna trouble you much
But we all need to know when enough is enough

So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
Somethings gotta give

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You only get one chance and that's one too much
What's the world gonna say when I call your bluff, punk?

Bow your head

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

I walk along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I couldn't get away

Dead as dead can be
The doctor tells me
But I just can't believe him
Ever the optimistic one
I'm sure of your ability to become
My perfect enemy

Wake up
And face me
Don't play dead
'Cause maybe
Someday
I'll walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

Leaning over you here
Cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection
What you could and might have been
It's your right and your ability
To become my perfect enemy

Wake up (why can't you)
And face me (come on now)
Don't play dead (don't play dead)

Overcome by your moving temple
Overcome by this holiest of altars
So pure, so rare,
To witness such an unearthly goddess
That I've lost my self-control
Beyond compelled to throw this dollar
Down before your
Holiest of altars

I'd sell my soul, my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss,
One taste of you, my Magdalena

I bear witness to this place,
This prayer, so long forgotten
So pure, so rare
To witness such an unearthly goddess

That I'd sell my soul, my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss,
One taste of you, my black Madonna

Pull me into your perfect circle

Liberate this will
To release us all

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this
Umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you

And from pulling you down with me in here
I can almost hear you scream

One more medicated peaceful moment
Give me
One more medicated peaceful moment

And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility
I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this

Run, desire, run
Sexual being
Running like a blade
To and through the heart, no conscience
One Motive: cater to the hollow

Screaming
"Feed me here, fill me up again"
Temporarily pacify this hunger
That's so cruel

Libido
Throw dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles,
In circles
Constantly consuming,
Conquer and devour

Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming
"Feed me here, fill me up again"
Temporarily pacifying

Feed me here, fill me up again
Temporarily pacifying

Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Over you

Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China
White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Little angel, go away
Come again some other day
The Devil has my ear today
I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace
And some peace of mind
Whatever, just as long as I don't feel so

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Over you

Break down, turn it around, hear the sound of laceration
The suffocating, devastating roaring of crowds
Dealing with the same vile people, same old bores
Get your head caught in revolving doors

Perfume, make-up -- it's a joke
Crucifixion, stiletto heels
Muscles and conversation -- it's a joke
Hatred forges nerve of steel

Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights

Taking off the city harness throw up in the kitchen sink
Cut while shaving, smashed the mirror,
Longing for another drink
Strange surroundings always drive me up the fire escape

A startling sense of dislocation
Pushed away by voodoo crap
Spill your poison somewhere else
Can't shake the needles from your back

Guns and chains, emotional drains
Cutting it down to size
Captured by the Hindu curse
That holds your mesmerized

Slice my throat with stiletto knife
To keep my burning hope alive
The long black hair that smells like incense
Turns to vipers in my mind

Foul the pyramids with your presence
Holding in your tiny claws
The snakes that feed the witch with venom
Too late, no time to withdraw

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

Sounds of torture and moral exhaustion
Barely concealed by telephone wires

Heal the wounds, and lick the scars,
Screw your eyes to read those stars
She is fire, I am ice,
Bound to burn at any price

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

I want to kill you

And all the hatred
It all built up inside her and she's letting it go

You better run
You better hide
'Cause she's gonna come and find you and take you for a ride

You better stop

There's no more time to run 'cause she's on the brink

In unseren Taschen klimpert Geld
Komm, nimm mich mit auf die Reise

Wir sind schön und wir sind jung
Unsere Farben sind so bunt
Komm, nimm mich mit auf die Reise

Und alle Träume werden wahr
Wenn nicht heut', dann nächstes Jahr
Komm, nimm mich mit auf die Reise

Seid guter Dinge, schaut nach vorn
Und wer nicht mit will, geht verloren
Brüder frohlocket!

Hurra, wir segeln in die goldene Zukunft
Hurra, seid ihr alle da?
Die Sonne scheint uns auf allen Sieben Meeren
Es ist ein großes, schönes Spiel
Die Segel sind voll gesetzt, wenn wir versinken
Das ist unser Ziel

Und egal wohin wir gehen
Für uns gibt es kein Problem
Komm, nimm mich mit auf die Reise

Lass uns voraus schauen, nicht zurück
Denn es trübt nur unseren Blick
Komm, nimm mich mit auf die Reise

Mach's wie die großen dieser Welt
Steig ihnen nach und sei ein Held
Komm, nimm mich mit auf die Reise

Seid guter Dinge, schaut nach vorn
Und wer nicht mit will, geht verloren
Brüder verlocket!

Das muss ja irgendwer bezahlen,
Also schreie mich nicht an.
Ich hab genug um die Ohren und keine Zeit,
Also stell' dich hinten an.

Wenn dieses Hamsterrad mein Grab wird,
War es wenigstens aus Gold (toll).
Wenn das wahre Leben einzieht,
Ist kein Platz für Rock'n'Roll.

Meine Bank klemmt mir die Eier ab,
Ich wollte nie 'ne Mastercard.
Lieber Gott, bitte rette mich
In den nächsten Monat.

Du willst wissen, wo es hingeht
Dein Platz in dieser Welt.
Der Glaube an das Gute
Verreckt im Mittelfeld.

Denn am Ende geht es immer nur um Geld.
Am Ende geht es immer nur um Geld.
Am Ende geht es immer nur um Geld.
Am Ende wollen sie alle nur dein Geld.

Sie sagen: Alles nicht so wichtig
Und das es eh nicht glücklich macht.
Kann mir dann irgendwer erklären,
Warum das immer die erzählen,
Die noch nie im Minus waren.
Und schon wieder werde ich vom Automaten belehrt,
Dass eine Auszahlung leider nicht möglich wär.
Was wollt ihr denn von mir?
Dass ich wiederkehr'?
Mit 'ner Sturmhaube und 'ner Softair?

Du willst wissen, wo es hingeht.
Doch du weißt, es ist egal.
Denn Träume baut man heute aus Papier und Metall.

Denn am Ende geht es immer nur um Geld.
Am Ende geht es immer nur um Geld.
Am Ende geht es immer nur um Geld.
Am Ende wollen sie alle nur dein Geld.

Am Ende wollen sie alle nur dein Geld.

Keinen Bock auf Frühstück.
Keinen Bock zu Duschen.
Bin es leid, jeden Morgen meine Schlüssel zu suchen,
Mich mit anderen Idioten auf die Autobahn zu stellen
Und mit 30 km/h bis zum Büro zu quälen.

Mir wurde früh erklärt,
Wie es läuft im Biz.
Ich habe spät gemerkt,
Dass das Schwachsinn ist.
Also bleib ich jetzt hier stehen
Oder fahr' ich über Land?
Im Leben steht man immer an der falschen Schlange an.

Ich will das so, ich brauch den Stress.
Und ich weiß, dass das gelogen ist.

Ich muss hier raus!
Ich muss hier raus!
Lass mich hier raus!

Denn Menschen nehmen das einfach hin,
Bis sie alt und schwach und verbittert sind.
Ich will nicht mehr so sein.
Wenn ich hier rausgeh',
Lass mich nicht allein.
Eine Stimme kommt von irgendwo her.
Sie wegzureden bringt nichts mehr.
Sie sagt: Flieh von hier.
Bitte flieh von hier.
Flieh von hier
Doch ich hab keinen Bock.

Doch ich hab keinen Bock auf Tatort,
Keinen Bock auf Fernsehen.
Schlechte Schauspieler treff' ich schon genug im Leben.
Hab' von allem zu viel.
Nein danke, hab ich schon.
Nehm' ich heute Langeweile oder Depression.

Ich weiß, was der Arzt sagt,
Ich brauch' keinen Psychiater.
Ich brauch nur ein Flugzeug auf versteckter Startbahn.
Ich reiß die Familie dann nachts aus dem Schlaf:
Es ist alles in Ordnung, wir hauen jetzt ab.

Ich will hier raus!
Ich muss hier raus!

Denn Menschen nehmen das einfach hin,
Bis sie alt und schwach und verbittert sind.
Ich will nicht mehr so sein.
Wenn ich hier rausgeh',
Lass mich nicht allein.
Eine Stimme kommt von irgendwo her.

Ich bin nicht deine Putzfrau
Ich mach den Scheiß nicht mehr
Und ständig trage ich dir deine Socken hinterher
Die gehören in die Wäsche ist denn das so schwer?
Ich verzweifle an dir
Ich glaub' ich liebe dich nicht mehr
Von deinem Job erzählst du gar nichts oder wenig
Und wenn ich frage sagst du "Das verstehst du eh nicht"
Früher warst du sportlich, witzig und gepflegt
Doch jetzt bist du nur noch peinlich, gelangweilt und bequem
Deine Königsdisziplin ist immer noch vergessen
Wenn es nicht so wäre würdest du vielleicht noch wissen
Was ich gerade noch gesagt hab, 3 Sekunden her
Na, liebst du mich noch? Oder weißt du es nicht mehr?

Denn ich weiß ganz genau, dass du jemanden schreibst
Ja Ja ich weiß ganz genau, dass du jemanden schreibst
Ich habe keinerlei Beweise und weiß nicht wie sie heißt

Doch ich weiß ganz genau, dass du jemanden schreibst

Und ich höre ganz genau wie oft dein Handy vibriert und ich weiß, dass du denkst, dass es mich nicht interessiert. Doch ich kenne deinen Plan.
Ich weiß du willst sie ficken.
Ein Messer stößt man besser von hinten in den Rücken!
Hab damals was getrunken um den ersten Schritt zu wagen.
Viel zu aufgeregt und feige für die Frage aller Fragen.
Und nach Jahren sind wir hier im selben Club was soll ich sagen.
Heute trinke ich um deine Fresse zu ertragen.
Und seit wann sagst du sowas wie "geht gar nicht".
Ich finde Leute die das sagen gehen gar nicht.
Man bist du eklig mit deiner Popelei.
Merkst du nicht, die Leute gucken schon; absichtlich vorbei.
Früher war der Bart top und die Unterhose frisch.
Heute riechts unter der Bettdecke nach abgeranzten Fisch.

Wenn ich reden will machst du den Fernseher laut.
Wenn ich Wärme brauch drehst du die Heizung auf.

Denn ich weiß ganz genau, dass du jemanden schreibst

Ja Ja ich weiß ganz genau, dass du jemanden schreibst
Ich habe keinerlei Beweise und weiß nicht wie sie heißt
Doch ich weiß ganz genau, dass du jemanden schreibst

Du kannst mich nicht verarschen.
Ich bringe all deine Taten ans Tageslicht.
Ich gebe unwahrscheinlich viel, doch was bekomme ich?
Denn alles was du sagst ist:

Ja Ja, ich weiß
Ja Ja, ich weiß
Ja Ja, ich weiß

Nägel durch die Glieder schlagen war euch nicht genug.

Ich habe abgewartet und mir das angesehen.
Jetzt komme ich zurück und bring' euch ein Problem.
Denn jetzt kommt die Revanche, sucht euch einen guten Sparringspartner.
Ich will euch nicht die Spannung nehmen, doch meiner war mein Vater.

Ich stürze auf die Erde, mach' mir einen Feuerschweif.
Brauchst du einen Vorgeschmack, gib' "Rammstein" bei YouTube ein.
Schluss jetzt hier mit Friede, Freude. Jetzt wird bezahlt,
Denn euer Jesus hat die Schnauze voll und hat Bock auf Gewalt.

Ich komm' zurück, mein Herz mit Hass erfüllt.
Mein Auftrag war Vergeltung, der finale Overkill.
Doch Vater, vergib mir, ich hab mich umentschieden,
Denn ich hab' acht Millionen Klicks und eine Show auf ProSieben.
Lass mich noch ein paar Jahre hier.
Bitte hol' mich nicht zurück zu dir.
Denn die sind nicht so wie früher,
Ich glaub', die haben's echt verstanden.
Die lieben mich, die wollen Fotos und Autogramme.

Denn ich bin Jesus Christus – Jesus Christus

Warum erst jetzt ein Star? Ich war doch immer da.
Scheiß drauf, ich genieße. Hab die Gage in der Schweiz geparkt.
Neue Jünger, neues Glück und jeder kriegt sein Stück vom Kuchen ab.
Hätt' ich doch damals Judas gut bezahlt.

Also, Falafel würd' ich
Niemals probieren
Weil die das Fleisch
Aus Polen importieren
Erst gegammelt und dann gegrillt
Das stand neulich
Ganz groß in der Bild

Ich werde niemals wieder
U-Bahn fahr'n
Mit Bombenlegern aus Islam
Erst fressen sie sich
Auf unsere Kosten fett
Und dann nehm' sie uns
Die Frauen und die Arbeit weg

Das is ein Unding
So kann's nicht weitergehen
Wir haben Angst
Dass hier 300 Moscheen stehen
Wir haben Angst um die Kinder
Denn in drei, vier Jahren
Werden sie totgeschlagen
Wenn sie kein Kopftuch tragen

An den Imbissbuden
Steh'n die Professoren
Zwischen Currywurst
Oettinger und Doppelkorn
Sie wissen ganz genau
Was fehlt im Land
Ich hab 'n Nazi am Geruch erkannt

An den Imbissbuden
Steh'n die Professoren
Der Schweiß tritt
Ihnen aus den Poren
Sie reden von den alten Werten
Mit Schaschliksauce in den Bärten

Neulich hat 'n Kumpel was erlebt
Der wollte nur nach Haus
Es war schon spät
Er bog ein, wie immer
In die Schillerallee
- Und dann?
Dann war's zu spät

Die hatten Sturmgewehre
Und Panzerfäuste
Haben Feuer gespuckt
Ich sag euch Leute
Das war höchstgefährlich
Also eins ist klar
Willst du überleben
Musst du Taxi fahr'n

Und so labern sie weiter
Ich wollt' nur kurz
Ein paar Fritten essen
Und schau dabei
Auf Flachmänner
Tittenheftchen
Und Arschritzen

An den Imbissbuden
Steh'n die Professoren
Zwischen Currywurst
Oettinger und Doppelkorn
Sie wissen ganz genau
Was fehlt im Land
Ich hab 'n Nazi am Geruch erkannt

Keine Ahnung, keine Gnade
Und immer 'nen dummen Spruch
Und kommt aus ihren Mündern
Mal was Wahres
Dann ist es Mundgeruch

Ein bisschen mehr Liebe
Und ein bisschen mehr Respekt
Nicht jeden Schwachsinn glauben
Lass die Zweifel doch mal weg
Die Grenzen endlich offen
Doch für dich sind sie noch da
Begreife doch, dass sie schon immer
Auf deiner Seite war'n

Es ist das Jahr 2015 und die Welt spendet Applaus,
doch worum es gerade geht, wissen wir selbst nicht so genau
Denn was hat sich verändert in den letzten fünf Jahr'n?
Also schau'n wir uns die Scheiße doch mal an

Siebenhunderttausend zahlt BMW der CDU
Plötzlich stimmt Frau Merkel neuen Abgasnormen nicht mehr zu
Obama ist noch da, und Guantanamo auch
Da wird ja schließlich nichts gemacht, außer viel Stromverbrauch

Die NSA hat seit Jahrzehnten jeden abgehört
und wir taten überrascht und war'n ne Woche lang empört
und dann flog Innenminister Friedrich rüber, alle horchten auf
Er kam wieder mit nem Zettel, da stand "fuck you" drauf

Und Putin rennt durch Wälder und killt Bären zum Vergnügen
und gibt grünes Licht, um Homosexuelle zu verprügeln
Gesetze werden über Nacht erlassen und diktiert
doch die NPD verbieten ist sehr kompliziert

Solang hier keine Sirenen erklingen
keine Soldaten durch unsere Fenster springen
keine Nachbarn nachts über Grenzen fliehen
und unsere Kinder nicht mit Splittern von Granaten spielen
ist das meilenweit weg, geht uns das gar nichts an
denn das Fernsehen spricht wie immer nicht von diesem Land
Und wie jedes Jahr am Silvesterabend
trinken wir auf unser Leben unter'm Tellerrand

Das war noch lange nicht alles

In Kairo und in Kiew treibt man Menschen in die Enge
Polizisten ticken aus und schießen wahllos in die Menge
In Nordkorea ist ein großes Kleinkind an der Macht
das nen Atomkrieg provoziert und denkt, es wär ne Kissenschlacht

Der Hunger in der dritten Welt hat keine Relevanz
aber wichtig sind uns Petitionen gegen Markus Lanz
Asylbewerberheime sind doch sicher, alles klar
Dreiundvierzig Anschläge, und das in einem Jahr

Solang hier keine Sirenen erklingen
keine Soldaten durch unsere Fenster springen
keine Nachbarn nachts über Grenzen fliehen
und unsere Kinder nicht mit Splittern von Granaten spielen
ist das meilenweit weg, geht uns das gar nichts an
weil ja ein Einzelner nichts verändern kann
Da muss man man dringend was tun, zumindest irgendwann
Es lebe das Leben unter'm Tellerrand

Ich hab vergessen dass wir eingeladen sind, wär ich doch im Büro geblieben!
Jetzt verbring' ich meinen Feierabend bei Tanja und bei Steven
Wo wir Scheiße reden, uns an Belangloses erinnern
Vor allem um die Peinlichkeit der Stille zu verhindern
Doch wir haben schon dreimal abgesagt
Als erster Gang kommt frischer Feldsalat
An Holunder-Vinaigrette
"Mensch du verwöhnst uns, ich brauche später dringend das Rezept"
Hör ich meine Freundin sagen
Und den Gastgeber mich fragen
"Ich habe auch noch Fingerfood und Dips, greif doch zu
Jetzt probier doch mal, was möchtest du?"

Ich möchte jetzt am liebsten einfach auf den Tisch steigen
Und dir deine blöde Pampe durchs Gesicht reiben
Doch der Geist ist willig, nur das Fleisch ist schwach
Hör doch einmal nur auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Wie oft stell ich mir vor, es einfach mal zu tun

Doch ich bleibe ein Idiot und sag nur "Oh, echt cool"

Um neun Uhr früh - sitz ich im Statusmeeting
Wie man sich denken kann, muss ich jetzt 'nen Status bieten
"Wie sieht's denn aus mit dem Konzept, haben Sie das gestern noch geschafft?"
"Nö, ich hab mit Katja und mit Steven drei Flaschen Rotwein leer gemacht"
Hab ich das wirklich grad gesagt oder nur gedacht?
Und die Kollegen werfen eine Powerpoint via Beamer an die Wand
Meine Gedanken sind woanders, jedenfalls nicht in diesem Land
Wie lustig das jetzt wäre, käm' ein großer Elefant
Hier rein
Wirft alle Möbel um, haut alles kurz und klein
Und setzt sich zu guter letzt auf meinen Chef drauf

Ich wache auf
"Herr Schönfuss, möchten Sie noch irgendetwas sagen?"

Ich möchte jetzt am liebsten einfach auf den Tisch steigen
Mir meine Hose runter ziehn und meinen Arsch zeigen
Doch der Geist ist willig, nur das Fleisch ist schwach

Hör doch einmal nur auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Ich habe unendlich Ideen und eine blühende Fantasie
Doch im echten Leben mache ich das nie, nie, nie!

Denn ich höre nie auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Ich höre nie auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Ich höre nie auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Würd ich doch nur mal auf das hören, was der Teufel sagt!
Er hört nie auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Er hört nie auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Er hört nie auf das, was der Teufel sagt
Er hört nie auf das, was der Teufel sagt

Jeden Freitag, 15: 00 Uhr setz' ich die Masse in Bewegung,
Steh' stundenlang vorm Spiegel und kauf' Billigschnaps im Rewe.
Scheiß egal, wo es hingeht, Haupstsache, nicht nach Hause.
Fünf Tage lief nur Coldpaly und jetzt kommt Mickie Krause.

An den Ampel dreht man Boxen laut, damit die Mädchen glotzen,
Doch die eine dreht sich weg, um auf den Bürgersteig zu kotzen.
Doch ist nicht weiter tragisch, der Abend nicht vorbei,
Denn ganz bestimmt hat irgendwer ein Kaugummi dabei.

Ich sag', wo immer du heut' landest, Mädchen sei dir stets bewusst:
Dass heut' Abend nicht mehr geil wird, hab' ich vorher schon gewusst.

Und umso später dieser Abend, desto hässlicher wird's hier.
Da drüben steht ein Typ, der isst 'nen Döner wie ein Tier.
Die Soße tropft ihm durch die Hände und dann schaut er zu mir.
Er wird heut' die große Liebe finden, ist doch erst halb vier.

An den Theken wechseln Getränke die Besitzer
Und die Gäste zahlen mit Geld und Speichelspritzern.
Der DJ spielt seit einer Stunde nur noch Depeche Mode,
Doch einer will nicht geh'n, er tanzt bis zur Atemnot.

Ich sag: "Junge, geh' nach Hause. Es sind keine Frau'n mehr da.
Dass das heute nicht dein Abend ist, ist uns beiden klar."

Also geht nach Hause!
(Geht nach Hause!)
Geht nach Hause!
(Geht nach Hause!)
Ihr schmeißt weiter eure Runden,
Sagt "Adieu!" zum Monatslohn.
Der Teufel steckt nicht im Detail,
Sondern im Alkohol.

Ich kann' euer Problem:
Ihr findet nicht das Ende.
Ich kenn' euer Problem
Und das heißt Alkohol.

Und wir schlafen nicht mehr ein

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside

At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart

Ooh, anymore

Hello from the other side

Alles was wir suchten
Haben wir gefunden
Hier an diesem Ort

Also gruben wir ein Loch in den Sand
Wie es in den Katalogen stand
Und wie wir von deinen Eltern
Oder deinen Verwandten
Oder deren Eltern kannten

Glas an Glas erklingt
Die goldene Katze winkt
Und ich hör jetzt schon wie
Dein Vater halleluja singt

Wir baun uns etwas auf
Und es lohnt sich alle mal
Wir tanzen durch den Staub
Und singen sha-la-la-la-la

Mit dem Fotoapparat
Und leckern Schnittchen in der Hand
Führen wir dich herum
Wenn du magst

Und hier ist längst nicht alles fertig
Und du hast recht, das Bild da hängt noch schief
Aber übermorgen fahrn die zu Ikea
Und dann sieht das gleich ganz anders aus
Doch jetzt stoß erst mal mit uns an und auf
Aus dem alten Trott sind wir jetzt endlich raus

Glas an Glas erklingt
Die goldene Katze winkt
Und ich hör jetzt schon wie
Dein Vater halleluja singt

Wir baun uns etwas auf
Und es lohnt sich alle mal
Wir tanzen durch den Staub
Und singen sha-la-la-la-la

Vor Freude weinst du wie ein Kind
Und ich hör jetzt schon wie

Wir krochen durch das Grass
Und warteten auf Licht

Sie zeigte mir die Stadt
Und unter einer der Laternen nahm sie meine Hand

Und hinter dem Hochhaus
Malten Menschen
Mit Raketen ein Feuerwerk
Diese Farben
Stechen manchmal
Wie Macheten bis ins Herz

Früher in der Nacht
Traf Sturm auf Gänsehaut
Wir zählten unser Geld
Und warfen es am Tresen raus

Die Frage nach der Menschlichkeit hat sie bejaht
Kurz bevor uns dieses Schwein aus seinem Laden warf

Und hinter dem Hochhaus

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea. I'm breathing alive

Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire
Where are you now?

Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightening, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
"Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon, what could
You do?

Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees

Uns wollen sie zeigen wo's langgeht.
Haha! Sind doch selber lange am Arsch.
Guck sie doch an die Arschlöcher:
Alles schön grau in grau, bisschen braun dazwischen.
Pfui, ich muss kotzen, wenn ich dran denk'.

In Deutschlands Strassen und Passagen,
in Deutschlands Zellen und Bordellen,
nirgendwo redet man mehr davon.
Über uns verliert man kein Ton.

Refrain:
Denn über uns spricht man nicht gern.
Vor uns hält man sich lieber fern.
Manche Leute wünschen uns den Tod,
doch in der Nacht brennt der Himmel feuerrot.

Wir leben, wir leben, wir leben immer noch!
Wir leben, wir leben, wir leben immer noch!
Oooooooooooooh!
Oooooooooooooh!

Dann kommen wir aus unser'm Loch
und ihr seht, es gibt uns noch.
Denn totgeweihte leben lang,
wenn du nicht aufpasst bist du dran.

und der brave Bürger schlafen geht,
dann zieh'n wir schreiend durch die Nacht.
Wir haben euch was mitgebracht!

You never gave me your strength
But I've always been stronger
You never gave me your love
But I've given you mine

You were just an illusion
My tormenting confusion
Was I ever good enough for you?

You were the butterfly in the glass jar
That I could never let go
Sewed and wrapped your wings off
So you couldn't fly away
Fly away from me

(just let me go)
(please, just let me go)

You never gave me your strength
Your love, your anything
Was I just an illusion,
Some tormenting confusion?
Was I ever good enough for you?

You were the butterfly in the glass jar
That I could never let go
Sewed and wrapped your wings off
So you couldn't fly away
Fly away from me

You were the person I could imagine
Spending the rest of my life with
In your arms, in your arms

I could never let you fly away
Please don't leave me, I said
(don't you) Don't you go
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna die within you
You were my butterfly
You're my butterfly

Please don't leave me, I said

People never see the other side of darkness.
There's no fear,
The faces of those you've hurt, they cannot even be seen,
But you'll never forget the one (who you meet) in the dark.

Within this place I've sensed no evil,
Only the absence of hurt that I had felt.
Death holds my heart and keeps me imprisoned
To shield me from another fall.

Without caution I moved towards nothing
And you have seen me somehow.
The imperfection in your mirrored reflection of a beauty
That died inside of me.

Darkness comforts me in this moment,
I'm slipping into comas of complication,
I want to embrace you, hold you.
The mind is plagued with the morbid hesitation.
Just tell me you're suffering
And I will give you everything
Though I have nothing,
But the darkness in my eyes.
The darkness in your eyes...

You found me in this, I found you a rose... of death.
Do I want you, could you want me?
Accept my bouquet of decay.
Am I an image that comforts your fantasy
Or will this surface turn my dark reality?
Are you the one, am I the one?
The wraiths have left me.
And sun will kill us, suddenly kill us.

Darkness comforts me in this moment,
I'm slipping into comas of complication,
I want to embrace you, hold you.
The mind is plagued with the morbid hesitation.
Just tell me you're suffering
And I will give you everything
Though I have nothing,
But the darkness in my eyes.
The darkness in your eyes...

Follow the roses down into the depths
And you'll see what has brought you here.
The wounds of the heart, the depletion of faith,
And the darkness inside your eyes,
Darkness inside my eyes,
Darkness inside your eyes.
Inside my eyes...

Flies invade your spoiled words,
Spoken once to comfort me.
But in your game I was deceived,
And now this question I ask of you:

Can you see me behind the lids which drape your eyes,
Waiting for that moment when all you've worked for dies?
In that place you call a heart, can my answer dwell?
Just utter the words to release me, deceiver,
From this doubt infested cell

A contraption of seduction, you encouraged my fall
From the place that resisted you
And when I failed to ignore my heart
You exposed a wound and bled me through

(The rage inside is building now
To conquer the bringer of my fading world
Nothing can protect that slayer of love
For pain can ignite an apocalypse)

Even angels have to die
With their ascension buried deeper
Our world, in time, shall become a grave
Inside there will be dirt instead of feelings

All our hearts must learn to break
For nothing beautiful lasts forever
The longing of what's lost shall never fade
A void is left and we feel so empty

Even angels have to die
No love on earth can restrain its ending
Sadness waits to claim our fall
And mourn for love that seeks its savior

Darkness finds me in my fate
The beautiful face which may bring salvation
Souls embrace a shattering wound
Have I strength to admit my desperation?

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die

Even angels have to die
But love is worth the tears that it brings me
I'll bleed with you 'til I am drained
Though my color may be less than perfect

Could the intent be to invade
This place where nothing dreams eternal?
Fear that you'll be torn away
Had lead me to my own decay

This thought of wasting haunts my mind
For my heart can't lose another angel

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die

Save me from apathy

Just speak those words that need to be

Inside your hell bound heart that tore me apart
Now here with me you will stay
And with your mind games I will play
Where your suffering tastes so sweet
Here you're nothing but the victim at my feet

I want to keep you away from the peace
The one that you deprived me before I had deceased
And what reason could you give for my death?
You're an angel killer, don't waste your breath

It was your hell bound heart that tore me apart
Now here with me you will stay
And with your mind games I will play
When your suffering tastes so sweet
You'll be nothing but the victim at my feet

An attraction to such discomfort arises from within.
And when all words are spoken this tension is released.
This beauty's metamorphosis into a beast.

Give in to your heart, (lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh,
Give in to your skin, (lust for your body)
Give in to your sin.

Give in to your heart, (lust for your body)

Give in to your skin, (lust for your body)
Give in to your sin.

Can you deny what festers so passionately inside?
Slaughter the necromancer that resurrects your bride.
Can these intentions penetrate a lover's lie?
Taste the lips of the moment and allow the soul to die.

Weep with me in the depths of my reality

And reveal the pain that once was beauty.

Sadness sleeps with me tonight,
My heaven had failed me again.

Was it your intent to hurt me?
Let me waste away, desert me?
Was it your hope to break me?
Let me perish, devastate me?

Weep with me before I abandon thee

How could I have been so foolish?
How could I have been so blind?
What will it take for me to find
The place where you are inside of my mind?
Within and safe,
Protected by tears.
Hiding, a cowards behind all of your fears.

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this great misery,
And nothing seems to make any sense to me.

Will this be a memory, will I have ever existed?
The words you spoke, could I have resisted?
Keep all of your heart and then depart
Before the wings of an angel had been torn apart.

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this great misery,
And nothing seems to make any sense to me.

I am more that what I have become,
But am naive to have believed that you were the one
To save me from this desperate state.
How my love has turned so deeply into hate?

I may be seen as perfect
But I still feel pain.
And all of your passions have been nothing
But a mind distracting game.

Just tell me what it is that I have done
To be a victim of hope and hated by the sun.
I find in all of this great misery,
Does any of this make sense to me?

Seeking winter I have found,
Something colder in my heart.
Hope depleting as I pass,
That which falls to pretend.
Never effort to offend,
But to restrain these dreams I'm having.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.

Palest rain that touched my face
As I ran towards a cruel illusion.
Hold this fragile thought in vain,
Tough that future will not save us.
Sleeping hell that wakes for me.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.

Time had consumed me
Open liquid falls from my eye
To hope that I seek comfort
For my insignificant demise

To cloud all reason
And accept this pain
With my hands raised towards nothing
Screaming for your uncertain lingering

Aged and strayed
And I've lost my heart's desire

Now I've made not we
This sacrifice you were
Too careless
To ever see

To this destination
So far from my mind
Omens have brought me so deep
And decayed

Aged and strayed
And I've lost my heart's desire

Now I bleed not we
My sacrifice you were
Too careless
To ever see

Aged and strayed
And I've lost my heart's desire

Too hopeless
To ever see

In sleep I find
No sympathy
And I've become
So numb

In the hour of passing
To this emptiness

Why do you hide your eyes from me?
There is no shame in empathy

I'm not perfect, there's no explanation.
I've not come for complication.

Stakes are made so that we learn,
Not stains that lead our souls to burn.

Why do you feel this way?

Have I failed you,
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide,
I see and love you as you are.

Why do you run from sadness?
It comes from someplace good.
If you've never truly loved,
Then you've never truly hurt.
Does that make make you feel weak?
And have I crossed that line?

Have I failed you,
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide,
I see and love you as you are.

Do not hide your face from me,
Tears are a sign of God's mercy.
As you cry, so does he.
I love you as you are...

Are higher than the ones you've known.
And it's much darker on this side,
See why my heart I had to hide.

It's in this place
I may be some prince, some king, some freak.
But it means nothing without your hand
Here in mine.

But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you.
But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you.

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go,
Inside my mind it's still not free.

Here I'm stronger.
No emotions to bring me down.
But what is it a heart
If we don't tear it apart
In a masquerade of game we play?

The lights above us,
These towers we could never climb.
You once were a star to lead me away
From the pain within my own decay.

But tonight I'm going to the city

Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb… (in bloom)

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave

Losing my soul

I'd like to fly,
But my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah

Come the morning light, it's a see-through show
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Sure you play your part, so you love the game
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah

I could set you free, rather hear the sound
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Inside, always trying to get back inside
But it's so hard to penetrate pig-thick skin

I'm 'bout as low as I can get
I'd leave but I can't forget
Still I wonder why, yeah, it ain't right, mmm it ain't right, oooh
Ain't right, mmm it ain't right, yeah

'Bout as low as she can get
She'll leave me but she won't forget
And she wonders why she ain't right, she ain't right
Ain't right, she ain't right

Now we're as low as we can get
Can't leave and can't forget
We ain't right, we ain't right
Not right, we ain't right

Well it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you
(ain't right)
When you can see, you were only high

It's all up to you, so you gamble

Flat on your face and into the fire

Hoa!

You say you don't like the way we look?
Well, fuck off!
I ain't some dying dog that you can kick
So fuck off!

It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

If you loved me would you call me a social parasite?
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right?

You say you don't like the place I'm in?
Well, get out!
There ain't no vacancy in my bed
So get out!

It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

If you loved me would you call me a social parasite?

Loneliness, it shadows me
Quicker than darkness
Crawls to the surface of my skin
Visibly surrounded by it

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free?

Surrounded by empty souls
Artificial courage used
And because so, once was mine
I walk this maze alone

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free?

Man's beside himself
Man's below himself
Man's behind himself
Am I inside myself?

Chaos and hate shadow me
Pain, it fills me up
Only one thing makes me feel
Missing better half of me

Black is all I feel
So this is how it feels to be free?

Man's beside himself
Man's below himself
Man's behind himself
Am I inside myself?

Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

All of your colors turn to grey
Don't even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Can't really say how you lost your mind

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold...

Crowned with a cold, blue sky

Withered and ugly,

Used to stand

Whispering of names,

And all that is gone

Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems

I've been told
Dreaming is free
Think I'll go
Back to sleep

Melodie!

Und Ruhe..

Und ich gab jedem Trauerfeierlied dieselbe Chance
Keins war genug monumental und herzzereißend, von Queen bis Elton John
Diesen Harfensängern überlasse ich doch nicht die Show auf meiner großen Todesfeier
Hier der Song vom Zeremonienmeister
Das Fest beginnt, ich stell es mir gigantisch vor
Ich hoffe doch ihr habt mir einen Elefant besorgt
Ich seh prasselnden Regen
In der Masse fließen Tränen
Kinderaugen fragen, wann sie Papa wieder sehen
Es gibt noch Fotos, da kann man mich in kraftbepackter Pracht betrachten
Ich hab auch T-Shirts und Kaffeetassen machen lassen
80 Tacken, die Bestattungskasse schluckt
Wer keins mehr kriegt, kann auch wahrscheinlich Bilder meiner straffen Brust auf allen privaten und offenen Kanälen
In Blogs und in jeglichem Wochenblatt sehen
Ich geh mal davon aus, dass das geklappt hat mit meiner Modellkarriere
Trotzdem Danke, für das zahlreiche Erscheinen
Aber ja nicht streiten
Etwas Wartezeit und jeder darf sich vor dem Sarg verneigen
Pssst...

(Hook)
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Wem ist heute keine Träne in die Hände geflossen?
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Der ist ein schlechter Mensch und wird von Engeln erschossen
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Doch es wird alles wieder gut
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Denn ihr hört dieses Lied im Loop
Meine letzten Worte, bevor ich zu den Sternen schweb: Gern geschehen

Hört ihr den Wind in den Bäumen singen?
Ich werd euch den Weg weisen
Ich bin hier oben, über euch
Wie schon zu Lebzeiten
Dir, holde Maid, bin ich ein Schutzengel im Wolkenreich
Wenn du jemand anderen fickst, dann werd ich eher Poltergeist
Jungs, ich werd euch auch fehlen, oder?
Denkt daran, dass ich euch stets mein Haustelefon gab
So viel gute Taten, alter sogar schon der Bäcker im Dorf
Meinte, wenn ich weg bin ist die Welt ein besserer Ort
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Also die Drecksarbeit
So'n Mausoleum bleibt nich von alleine fleckenfrei
Und rächt meinen Mord doch schafft euch Heimvorteil
Wenn er mich besiegt hat, muss er ein Cyborg sein
Hab mittlerweile mir bestimmt 'ne Religion zugelegt
Um so so gut es geht
Der Angst vor dem Tod souverän zu entgehn
Hab nie großspurig Hochmut gelebt
Doch Paradiese reißen sich um mich, Losbudenmäßig - eyyyyy

(Hook)

Orchester
Piano
Feuerzeuge
Gesangssample

Und meine letzten Worte, bevor ich zu den Sternen schweb
Man mich in Särge legt und in die Erde gräbt:
"Ich hab dir mehr gegeben, als dein Wert beträgt
Wir woll'n nicht Erbsen zähl'n - Gern geschehn.."

Und ich gab jedem Trauerfeierlied dieselbe Chance
Keine Musikkapelle konnt mich überzeugen
Also schrieb ich schnell und prompt ein
Falls-ich-nie-mit-Nachwuchs-zu-meinen-Schwiegereltern-komm-dann-hinterlass-ich-lieber-dieser-Welt-nen-Song

Wie man eine Liebe maximal romantisch lebt, will jeder wissen
Keiner hilft uns - Fair play
Gott sei dank gibt es Film und Fernseh'n, da, wo ich meine Bildung her nehm'
Glaub mir, das wird super, für deine Story hab ich schon den Grund
Weshalb du in deiner Jugendphase wutgeladen bist
Dein Papa kam nicht zu deinem Schultheaterstück
Bei mir finden wir schon was, wo der Schuh gerade drückt
Wir kennen uns seit X Jahren, du brauchst jetzt nix sagen
Ich wollt dich fragen: Wollen wir den nächsten Schritt wagen?

Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?
Dann wird es rote Rosen regnen
Ich hab's in einer Soap gesehen
Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?

Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Denn ein Wrack ist ein Ort, an dem ein Schatz schlummert

Jetzt sind wir frei, chillen auf gigantischen Berggipfeln
Du musst dann sagen: Keiner kann unsern Schmerz diggen
Wir sammeln erstmal fröhliche Kiff-Sonntage
Für die hituntermalte Schnittmontage
Komm schon, das wird romantisch
Wenn ich dich halte, damit du nicht auf den Klorand brichst
Dann verdienen wir ein Kerzen-Paket
Für die erste WG auf 'nem Herren-WC
Eine herbstliche Szene, weil es passt
Und ich falle auf die Knie und hol aus meiner Jacke
Eine kleine Schachtel, du weißt, was abgeht

Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?
Dann wird es rote Rosen regnen
Ich hab's in einer Soap gesehen
Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?

Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Denn ein Wrack ist ein Ort, an dem ein Schatz schlummert

Und dann brauchen wir epische Fights, wer das lausige H kriegt
Zuschauer: rauchende Babys
Sie werden nicht verwöhnt, die müssen Fertigsuppe löffeln
Und die spielen mit vom Körperbau entfernten Puppenköpfen
Du willst raus per klischeehafter Flucht in ein Landhaus
Ich brüll dann so was wie: "Gleich rutscht mir die Hand aus!
Du wirst mit den Kindern nirgendwohin fahr'n!"
Ich werd euch mit 'ner Axt durch ein Labyrinth jag'n
Im Winter, weil ich das Bild feier
Mach unser Leben filmreifer als Til Schweiger
Es hat Action, Drama und Comedy
Also was sagst du, mon chéri?

Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?
Dann wird es rote Rosen regnen
Um dem Kinofilm die Show zu stehlen
Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?

Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter
Komm! Denn ein Wrack ist ein Ort, an dem ein Schatz schlummert

Komm, wir geh'n- (Den Bach runter)
Komm, wir geh'n- (Den Bach runter)
Komm, wir geh'n- (Den Bach runter)
Komm, wir geh'n, komm, wir geh'n zusamm'n den Bach runter

Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love, it's very late
'Til morning comes
Let's tessellate

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One bird, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins

Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up
Yes, they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me

Heimdall gazes east
A sail has caught his eye
He lifts his hand and sounds the horn
The undead army has arrived

Here comes Nagelfar
With Laufey's son on board
He brings chaos, hate and wrath
He brings the war to end all wars

Heimdall knows his fate
The end of all nine worlds
It's what the Vala has foreseen
He knows that everything shall burn

Facing Lopt's deceit
Now they finally meet
The champion and his enemy
On Vigrid's plains they'll find defeat

Their swords meet in a mighty clash
War cries sound, horns they blast
Their eager weapons whip and thrash
This day when all shall end

The lords of war are equal strong
This battle frantic and forlorn
The blades sing a macabre song
This day when all shall end

Heimdall's blade bites burning sharp
As it cuts through flesh and bone
Blood comes gushing from the wound
As Loke's head falls tumbling
Rolling to the burning ground

Look to my burning eyes
Plead for your worthless life
All remorse I had has died
And all I have is hate inside

You took my soul from me
You took my family
You killed them all ferociously
Now this is what I give to thee

Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs are cracked
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Terror grips your dying heart
Blood eagle!

Helpless on the ground
Hands and feet tightly bound
In my eyes no mercy found
My sharp knife starts to carve around

Penetrate your naked skin
Rip flesh and dig within
With a pleased and twisted grin
I spread your lungs like eagle's wings

The burning grief is tormenting me
The hate I feel is destroying me
Only vengeance will give me peace
Only vengeance will set my spirit free

Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs will crack
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes will stare
Slow death grips your tortured heart
Blood eagle!

Racing 'cross the arctic lands
A mounted legion
Under my command
We're a brutal force
No men can withstand
Total havoc is at hand

See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside

The fateful message
Reached us months ago
That our home was under siege
And since that day
We've been heading north
Our kinsmen needed our relief

As we near our fortress walls
Black smoke is rising to the sky
Burnt black ruins
Of our father's halls
And corpses greet our tired eyes

What madness led them to attack
Victory could not be won
They must've known
There was no turning back
And now they all are gone
No woman, child or man was spared
Their bodies lying where they fell
Suffering, anguish and despair
As they went through living hell

So now we're on the ride again
And vengeance is
Our newfound path
We draw our strength
From grief and pain
These bastards shall know
Our endless wrath

See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide

Since I was born, they have kept me down,
They have forced me to conform.
I will tear down the holy crown in a vengeful thunderstorm,
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise,
Fueling flames of violent rage,
I will be their world's demise.

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods

All this rage, and all this hate,
It burns me deep inside,
And still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive.
Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me.

Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!

Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne

So he found the heart in barren land
It was beating, still alive
He held it gently in his hand
And looked up to the sky

With evil thoughts of vicious kind
And sinister disdain
His thoughts of bringing back to life
The witch that died in flames

Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

He then devoured Gullveig's heart
And she was born again
They brought to life an evil force
A beast that can't be tamed

With dark deception in his soul
Betrayal of the gods
The bane of Oden now is born
Born of evil blood

Serpent's kin
Born of sin

A vile beast that cannot be tamed

Raised in Asgård, the home of gods
I am the master of disguise
For this trait I've gained your prize

Fast in thought, quicker tongue
Brawl with me and you'll get stung
I am the master of deceit
My words bind or set you free

I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter

You call me evil; curse my name
But you only have yourselves to blame
Order need its anarchy
Balance through calamity

We mixed our blood in olden days
Now I wander like a stray
We were brothers, now estranged
I will have my sweet revenge

My words are poison to your ears
I say the words you fear
Still you know it is the truth you hear
Ragnarök is drawing near

There you sit in Aegir's hall
Waiting for the coming fall
Council of the now condemned
Twilight of both gods and men

Face the facts; you're old and weak
Empty words are all you speak
No escape, there's no return
The universe shall bleed and burn

Never give in
Prospects are bleak
We can't win

There is no hope
No time for lament
End of the rope
Our lives are spent

We have held out for months
Hoping for relief
Our fortress now our tomb
And salvation now our grief
We have held out for months
Waiting for relief
Our fortune's now our own
This is destiny

Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements never showed
As the daylight starts to fade
There's nothing left to lose
We have run out of time
There is nothing left to choose
Expect how we shall die

Open the gates!
Now we attack!
Ride into fate!
No turning back!

Stand by the King!
To glory we ride!
Weapons and shield!
Together we die!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
All the world shall know our bravery!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
One last charge for death or victory!

We were the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We'd never lost a fight in war
We feared not the grave

The ruler of this northern court
My brother, lord, king
He always had our loyal swords
But we would feel his sting

The ageing king had no decendants
No heir to take his throne
It filled his soul with fear
Transcendent
That next in line was my first-born

The king's heart grew
Full of dark deception
Full of foul conspiracy
This was when dark days
Had their inception
And we fell to his vile deceit

Robbed of arms, robbed of pride
But he spared our lives
The fear he had of Oden's wrath
Held his vengeful knife

With hearts so cold we left our homes
Banished from our land
A life in shame, a life in grief
Until we rise again

Winters come, winters pass
Twenty wasted years
We're ageing men, our youth is gone
We will shed no tears

Winters come and winters pass
Tenty years have gone
Like a dream we fade away
Into oblivion

We are the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We're old but strong as before
And we don't fear the grave

From the south an army rises
They ride under cross of gold
From the shades we're called
In a time of crisis
To defend the king now weak and old

As the flames of warfare rage higher
We feel our destiny's embrace
We are ageing men of an old empire
Now we can see Valhalla's gates

We!
March again
First in line
To reach Valhalla's mighty gates

We!
March again
March to fight
To reach Valhalla's mighty
We!
March again
Give our lives
To reach Valhalla's
Mighty royal gates

Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall

Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in savage game
Our spirits, spears
And shields are linked
In a much stronger chain

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls
All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Charge with force! Break their ranks!
No remorse, crush their flanks!
Pulverize their human wall!
We shall destroy!

I'm tryin' to get some fresh air
Aye, why you got the roof off, roof off?
You know it never rains here
Aye, you ain't gotta flash when you takin' your picture
You ain’t gotta draw no extra attention
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dying for less, I hear

I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryin' to throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babies
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas cryin' for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror

I can't be ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can’t be flyin' down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip

You probably think a nigga trollin'
Or showin' out for the cameras
Fuck I'm doin' fish-bowlin’?
One hundred thou' on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in his image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Now hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
(I need tint) 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure
(I need tint) So I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and I do fine, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches

Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)

Stretch it out, that's a limo
Pull it over, let me get behind you
Where we goin', they don't need to know
Ghost riding in a Phantom
Niggas never see me comin'
She wanna hold me like a ransom
But the money keep me runnin'

Can see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
Who got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming, no

You were mine
Pretty flowers in the gardens of the town
Change or the sun won't shine
Change or the rain comes down

You were mine
But now it's the end of the in-between
Gone are the days
When the ammunition was clean

Change or the sun won't shine

Outside stories of misdemeanors grow
Seeing the blade in the rays
Running for cover they go, too late
How they come and how they fall
Baby cradle and all
Baby cradle and all

Close the door
Though it seems like we only kissed hello
It looks like it's time to go
It looks like it's time to go in the light
Somehow the craziness dissolves
Change or the sun won't shine (change or the sun won't shine)
Change or we end it all

Change or the sun won't shine

Change or the sun won't...
Change or the sun won't shine

Change or the sun won't...

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

There's a gulf war vet, dying a slow cold death
And the government says, "We don't know the source of his sickness."
But don't believe what they say, because your government is lying
They've done it before, and don't you know they'll do it again
A secret test, government built virus
"Subject Test Group: Gulf Battle Field Troops"

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

First World War veterans slaughtered, by General Eisenhower
You give them your life, they give you a stab in the back
Radiation, agent orange, tested on U.S. soils
Guinea pigs for western corporations
I never have, I never will
Pledge allegiance to their flag
You're getting used, you'll end up dead

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

I don't need you to tell me what to do
And I don't need you to tell me what to be... FUCK YOU!
I don't need you to tell me what to say
And I don't need you to tell me what to think! What to think!
What to think, what to think, what to think, think, think, think!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?

A bunch of punks hangin' out on the streets before a show.
Patty wagon pulls up -instinct- 'Run man, let's just go!'
Cop chaces them through the streets and then they go inside
They run into a crowd where maybe they can hide

Fuck police
Fuck police
Fuck police brutality!
Fuck police brutality!
Fuck police brutality!
Fuck police brutality!

He hides just standing in the crowd
there's nowhere he can run
The cop comes up behind him and he cracks him with his gun.
Drags his bloody ass outside and throws him to the ground.
'There's nowhere else to take you boy, you're already downtown.'

Fuck police
Fuck police
Fuck police brutality!
Fuck police brutality!
Fuck police brutality!
Fuck police brutality!

But the cops can do no wrong.
They can kill, they can rape, they can do what they want,
But the cops can do no wrong.
We've got to fight, take back the night,
the cops are just like Hitler's Third Reich,
do what they want.

Who do we fear? Who do we trust? How do we know?

The {Downing Street} memo says...

...We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
Roll the propaganda out using The People's Voice

We don't want to talk about it...

The press scribble scribble every half-truth spoke
Then shoot it round the country like an April Fools joke
Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care!

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
Oh! Whoa!
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute

Ohhhhh, whoa!

And on the TV screen...
...Diversion and aversion is the flavor of the day
Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
The White House Press Corpse only has one thing to say...

"We don't want to talk about it!"

The White House boils over, "Al Jazeera got it wrong!"
The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing the White House song
While over in Iraq thousands are dead because of lies
The spineless war drumming-press corpse have taken lives

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
Oh! Whoa!
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute

Ohhhhh, whoa!

1, 2, 3, 4!
1, 2, 3, 4!

Fires fueled on endless lies
Black shrouds coat desert skies
A nation's viewpoint blurred and led
As embeds report what they're fed

We don't want to talk about it...
We don't want to talk about it...
We don't want to talk about it...
We don't want to talk about it...

(We don't want to talk about it...)
We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk about it
(We don't want to...)
We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute
Oh! Whoa!

Wave the flag and cowardly salute

It's in the paper every day
I see it in the headlines and I feel so sick, yeah
As another life leaves this world (this world) so full of hate
But short
Short on compassion
Short on humanity
Asking myself in vain, shaken by the shock,
"Do we even have a chance?"

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

I don't wanna die

I don't wanna kill

We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

This is a plea for peace (world peace)
To the oppressors of the world and to,
To the leaders of nations, corporate profit takers,
to the everyday citizen
Greed, envy, fear, hate - the competition has to stop.
When you see someone down, now's the time to pick them up
Set your differences aside and never look back, no

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human
It's time to prove it.

I don't wanna die

I don't wanna kill

We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

Isn't everybody tired of the fighting? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the killing? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the dying? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the hatred? (hey, hey)
Violence(hey, hey).. fighting(hey)... killing(hey)...dying(hey).. aaaaaaah!!

(excerpt from Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech:)
So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow,
I still have a dream
we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children,
black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing
"Free at last, free at last.
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last."

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human
It's time to prove it.

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

We are all human

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past
It moves too fast
I got no chance
A freight train racing set to crash

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Wake up wondering: "How' did I get here?"
Then cross my heart and say a fuckin' prayer
Ecstasy, tears
Bravery, fears
This boat may float but it don't steer

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Life's long and winding roads leading us to
A never ending trail to keep our youth
It flashes by in lessons painfully attained
Blood and sweat, black and blue
Some surrender I got nothing' to surrender to

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

So now you're livin'
So now you're livin'

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past

See our sense of shame and throw it overboard
See our moral compass set to so past bored
I guess conscience really does just make cowards of us all
See us turn a blind eye till it's criminal
See us walk away until we can't walk anymore
I guess conscience really does just make us look like fools

You've been washing out the faces of your friends again

See us right the ship, take back control
See us fight like hell for the way it was before
I guess judgement really should just come from our enemies

You've been washing out the faces of your friends
You've been wishing that they'd give you another chance again

Als wir noch real waren, hingen wir nur rum in einem Keller
Und nahmen nur Tracks auf, wir war'n Untergrund-Rapper
Die Lieder war'n cool, doch das Mikro war kaputt
Manchmal hatten wir ein' Auftritt und niemand hörte zu
Heute ist das anders, wir ham jetzt Erfolg
Uns're traurigen Augen ham den Glanz schon verlor'n
Ein Mann über Bord, trotzdem machten wir weiter
Verkauften die Seele aus Raffgierigkeit
Die Musik wurde schlechter, die Brieftasche fetter
Die Texte zu ernst, Ironie ist zu Ende
Anstatt weiter Klamauk zu machen
Hielten wir es für klug, jetzt was auszusagen
Platte Phrasen, reines Kalkül
Was man so macht, wenn man ein Reihenhaus will
Das fake Anti-Image, dass uns die Kids glauben
Und gesungene Hooks, weil wir Hits brauchen


Das ist die neue Antilopen Gang
Die Unschuld ist verlor'n, wir tun jetzt, was wir woll'n
Es geht nur noch um Erfolg
Die neue Antilopen Gang
Aus der Vergangenheit gelernt, wir machen ab jetzt ernst
So vermarkten wir uns selbst
Das ist die neue Antilopen Gang
Die Seele ist verkauft, das Leben ist versaut
Doch wir geben niemals auf
Das ist die neue Antilopen Gang (Ey!)
Die neue Antilopen Gang (Ey!)


Ich weiß noch genau, wie das alles begann
Per Wochenendticket mit der Bahn durch das Land
Auf die Bühnen der Jugendzentren und Dorfdiskos
Vorhang auf für ein kleines bisschen Horrorshow
Und waren wir mal broke bei 'ner Session
Haben wir im Supermarkt halt geklaut, um zu essen
Und jetzt kau' ich den Seeteufel, reit' mit dem Bauch
Wir haben uns're Seele an den Teufel verkauft
Yeah - Jetzt sind wir sexy, weil wir reich sind
Nächstes Jahr machen wir denselben Dreck wie Deichkind
Und keiner fühlt die Parts, doch sie spülen das Konto voller Geld, das ist besser, als es früher war
Und wir waten durch moralischen Morast
Das Drama um Jakob hat unser'n Namen groß gemacht
Aber hey mir geht es gut, wirklich oberaffengeil
Ich hab' es doch gesagt, Antilopen macht reich




Damals war'n wir jung und wir brauchten das Geld
Heute sind wir dumm und versaufen das Geld
Wir tauschten uns're Seele lieber ein gegen was Schönes
Da sie im März 2013 aufhörte zu leben
Mussten tausend Tode sterben und aus den Tragödien lernen
Dass das Einzige was zählt ist ein Vermögen anzuhäufen
Vermarkten nun den Widerstand gegen Vermarktungsstrategien
Kapitalisier'n Anti-Kapitalismus-Attitüden
Ich hab' nix zu sagen, dafür steh' ich mit mei'm Namen
Wenn du mich bekehren willst, redest du dich um Kopf und Kragen
Früher war'n wir DIY, Free-Download, Soli-Gig
Heute leg' ich auf dem Spiegel Lines südamerik Kokain
Jeder, der mein Album runterlädt, schuldet mir Geld
Mein Anwalt schickt dir Abmahnungen rund um die Welt
Es gibt nur ein Problem, du kriegst diese Gang aus dem Aschenbecher
Doch den Aschenbecher nicht aus der Gang




Wir geben keinen Fick und wir nehmen alles mit
Es geht eh nicht mehr zurück und wir sehen es als Witz

So now that you know it's right
Can you see it from the otherside
Do you see there is no wrong or right
Can you leave them in another tide
There will be no other promise
I can now give to show the other slight
So the ground will make your love light
Hold the sleepers to the morning light

But as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all

So do you lead them to the light
Tie the noose or settle sides
Can you bring them to another life
Can you breathe into a lovers lie
So while we sink into a second sign
Fold the leaves into a dotted line
You will see the limbs of love and pride
Follow suit without a single sigh

So as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all
It made no sense at all
It made no sense at all

One by one we told ourselves
That they would keep the promises that we made
We made your sons and daughters
They will be nothing like us

I'll never tell you again
So pay your lips to be the seconds I count in over
And breathe life into cold, cold hearts
We will not tell you again,
We will not falter again

So as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all
It made no sense at all
It made no sense at all

I'll never know what leaves your heart
When I will fall, it's to your side
I'll never know what leaves your heart
When I will fall, it's to your side

Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low

Sunk this low

(Rotten to the core)
So who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
Now we're gone, left without a trace
But we took something they cannot replace

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror

You knew all along that the cancer would spread
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Sorry son but we destroyed your home
We murdered your family, now you're on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall, it's all just part of the plan

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
And every execution
The price of your collusion

Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low

Sunk this low

You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core

The workers all march to the beat of the drum
Their spirits are broken, they have nowhere to run
They dream of courage and a loaded gun
But the slaves all know they better bite their tongue

Track marks across the planet
Are there any veins left for them to infect?
They would kill one another just to disconnect

Three cheers for desperation
God bless the godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin

The workers all march to the beat of the drum
They fell into the trap, taken one by one
The medicine is poison but it makes them numb
'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret
Existence is just something they would rather forget

Three cheers for desperation
God bless the godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin

Is this freedom, is this the life you chose?
If this is living the dream, we've hit an all time low

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win
Sick and tired of the world they're living in

There was a time for change, I fear it came and went
Who's gonna pick up the pieces, who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's no turning back

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn
We just wanna watch the world burn

Our collapse will be remission
A planet scarred beyond all recognition
Suicide in slow motion, is this the path we have chosen?
Too cowardly to face this; we've got a fucking death wish

You want to play with fire? Don't cry when you get burnt
You gave us life, we gave back death in return
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's not turning back

We will consume until there's nothing left
Remember us as a waste of breath

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die

I want to be there to witness the downfall

They'll only sell us out when our backs are turned
And we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Every snake has its price
If the money's on the table they don't think twice
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin

We are paralysed
But there are none so blind as those who will not see
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck
About what matters to us

Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette
They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Always out for blood, praying on the weak
We can count on them to paint the future bleak
But still we're standing by whilst they bleed us dry

There is no end game
So whisper the truth and pass on the blame
Just put us out of our misery, this defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

A failed evolution
Is the problem the solution
That they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone

A thorn in the side of the earth
Where do you draw the line? A flaw in the design
The rest is history, this defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger

We may be infinite but this world is not
Something that we once knew that we long forgot
That we long forgot

We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last

The weight of the world is resting on thin ice
When the surface breaks will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect
What a waste of time I was in retrospect

I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

Annihilate me

Do you remember when you said to me
"My friend, hope is a prison"?
Hope is a prison

Of all the patterns that I could create
I built a labyrinth with no escape
To keep myself under lock and key
I am my own worst enemy

I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
(God knows I lost all my faith)

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?

Accept that what is meant to be (Is meant to be)
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?

This is a wake up call, no rise without the fall
Facing the great divide, you can run but you can't hide

You can run but you can't hide

I met the devil and God and couldn't tell them apart
I thought I found the end but it was only the start

I've heard it all before
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
(Just let go) Gravity, hold on to me

So come and wash us away
Just thank fuck that we don't last forever (It's now or never)
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere
Because it's gone and it's never coming back

But make no mistake
It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks
So stand your ground, the earth will shake
So twist the knife 'cause I am finally awake

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, let me live and die in peace

(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)

I will be consumed, returned into the earth
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow
Cut the chord and cast me out, and cast me out

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law

Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease

"Change
And everything is change; nothing can be held on to
To the degree that you go with a stream
You see, you are are still; you are flowing with it
But to the degree you resist the stream
Then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you
So swim with it, go with it, and you're there; you're at rest"

It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own
It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own

When my heart skips two beats
I am hidden deep, fast asleep
The sea will part where oceans meet
Finally complete

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay's the only law

Swan song, a declaration of endlessness
I swear I will not look back as I return into the black
When the veil lifts, how will I know, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace

This is the great esoteric depression
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation

We are all the shades of misery
The reigning champions of tragedy
They use their faith as a weapon, they count our sins by the seven
Blackwater at the gates of heaven

All hail the corporatocracy
The word of God written in binary
All hail our apostasy
The dying notes in an unholy symphony

All our gods have abandoned us
This is the great esoteric depression
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation

I found God clutching a razorblade
He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold"

The saddest story of all that ever was
Or will be, laid out before me
A living heart attack, play it back, play it back

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense
Past and future tense, every moment is dead to me
Safe and sound, anywhere but here
I see it crystal clear but it means nothing to me

It means nothing to me

Have you seen a future filled with regret?
Breathe and count to ten, start over again
You want to run away, just let yourself decay
A living heart attack, play it back, play it back

The empty hourglass, we're going nowhere fast
There's no more time to kill if time is standing still

Desperation breathes and follows you home
Just look around– you're not alone...;
One life, one chance; the world in front of me

Intelligent design, sending shivers up my spine
Cells mutate and divide
What a sadistic intention

No light! No dark!
No ups! No downs!

No Heaven or Hell to bring– me– home

Separation from what we know is right
The wind was taking us in the wrong direction
It's about time we showed some disaffection

Carry the weight of thousands of years
Turn the page, let's make it all disappear
We've had enough of inhibited progression
Held back by cloak-and-dagger oppression

We're insulting our own intelligence
I won't listen without any evidence
I'll live my life in the name of no one
Bow your head, palm to palm
Worship here in this cerebral cathedral

As day breaks, the sunlight heals
As day breaks, the light reveals
These chains that we've been living in...;
How easily we've been giving in!

Now shed this skin and let change begin...;

As day breaks, the sunlight heals
As day breaks, the light reveals

Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking

It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking

Upon the upper edge, reality dawns!

Still I sleep alone at night
In years you'll thank me
For getting everything right
I am the sun
Still I sit alone in a red sky
Keeping my eyes on you
Were all alone

In time you'll find that
Were all on our own (all on our own)
Were all on our own , chasing nothing
My dreams have fallen , I'm wearing thin
I need something to fill this void I'm constantly in
And I can't do this

I am your hero
I just don't care tonight
In years you'll forget me
I got everything right
I am the sun
I didn't rise today
I left you in darkness

And I just don't care anymore about you
You can sit and suffer alone without me

I am your hero
Save your "thank you"'s

In times to come ill rise above this
But for now I can't ill just sit here
My dreams have fallen once again
My dreams have fallen once again

There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me

When we all fade away
And this world can't bare another day
There will be no fight in broken bliss

I feel it now more than ever
A reaper's watch, my life ready to sever

Your name carries more than disease
A symbol of man brought to his knees

This is not about what we deserve
There's no bias in the misery served

C.A.N.C.E.R

Find a little light and hold it close
Don't lose sight of what matters most

Find a little light and hold it close
Don't lose sight of what matters most

This is a burden we all carry together
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never

And when we all fade away
And this world can't bare another day
There will be no fight in broken bliss

So watch the sun sink into the sea
There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me

Dear, oh dear...
What a sorry state we're in
We brought the battle, we saw the signs
We've found ourselves two steps behind

I'm counting days like they're running out
There's ghosts in the water, so prey for drought

This time there's nowhere to hide
We're facing the firing squad side by side

1986
This is full relapse
Our latest apocalypse
This is colony collapse

Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose
We truly believed all we touched turned to gold
We were warned but we wouldn't be told

I'm counting days like they're running out
There's ghosts in the water, so prey for drought

This time there's nowhere to hide
We're facing the firing squad side by side

They said that the ocean's on fire
Say it isn't true...
The truth never hurt so much
Can we start anew?

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

You've got to watch your back
You've got to swallow fear
Cover your tracks or you might disappear
They found the words to speak unspeakable things
They struck the air from the chests of kings

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea...
Would you run and hide or stand for what you believe?
Maybe Orwell was right all along...
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
Swear that you won't forget!

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
Swear that you won't forget!

Tell the rats to get back in the gutter
We'll be watching
We're always watching

You try to stamp them out
You'll only fan the flames
This is for all the snakes: FUCK YOU!

So hold your forked tongues
You've got us spitting nails
I'm gonna say it straight: FUCK YOU!

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun

An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vulture posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become
You are the reason we are bitter and then some

Bitter and then some

They sing of saviors, we sing of sorrow
But we're still holding on for dear life

You sold us all down the river
I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver
You said you'd change the world but death still flies east
The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we've seen this all before

We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank, oh

They say, "The more things change, the more they stay the same"
Whilst the liars leech, the crooked preach
So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it
In beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?

You fucking parasite

There's no room in here for an honest man
Only callous and cold hearts

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we've seen it all before

Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand
Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand

We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

With every concession, another piece of us dies
Will we fight for nothing if not our lives?
Apathy is our new messiah
Only He could let things get so dire

All the messengers found knives in their backs
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire
All the messengers found knives in their backs

I know it haunts you; it haunts me too

Hey, hey, they live this, day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist

This is where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold
You know they're here when the water is red
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread

A message etched on broken ships

Hey, hey, they live this, day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist

You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out

She's bleeding out

Their innocence is heaven sent
Their malevolence, it will not relent
A graveyard sits upon the shore
They won't swim together anymore

The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near
The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near

The devil is near

"If we're going to survive on this planet
We have to respect the right of all species to survive
For we need them more than they need us"

A message etched on broken ships
We'll be here till corruption quits
There is a voice though they cannot speak
Not yet ready to admit defeat

You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out
You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out

Where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold

If only you were here to hold my head above bloody waters
We could make it through
You turned your back on me and now I do the same to you
You made me feel so hollow
How can the man that you looked up to turn around and say three words that hurt more than you'll ever know
You don't know what it feels like to be in my shoes
You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor
This time there's no reason for me to turn around and scream for help
But if only you were here to hold my head above all those things you said to tie me down
I'm looking for forgiveness for something that I didn't even do
How can you call yourself and idol, a person to trust?
How can I look so high up when you're always holding me down?

There's a look on your face I would like to knock out
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Though we won't ever meet I remember your name

Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway

You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
That the cracks in your smile are beginning to show
Now the world needs to see that it's time you should go
There's no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow

Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can, so fuck you anyway

Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
So much crap coming out, it must take you all day

There's a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
When you look at yourself do you see what I see
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?

There's a time for us all and I think yours has been
Can you please hurry up 'cause I find you obscene
We can't wait for the day that you're never around
When that face isn't here and you rot underground

Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway

If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
'Cause your decapitating habits feel a little bit orgasmic
If I gave you a hatchet
It would be yours to have
I kind of like the feeling when you stab me in the back
Every time i see you
Look me in the eye
I look straight back
'Cause a part of me will die
If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back

If I had a pistol
It would be yours to have
You could shoot me in the head blow a hole in my back
If I gave you a pistol
I wouldn't need it back
You could aim between my eyes and I'd still be yours to have
Every time I see you
I've got the urge to cry
I'm holding back the tears
'Cause I know the reason why
If I had a pistol
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

If I had an army
It would be yours to reign
People think I'm crazy but the pain is worth the pain
If I gave you an army
It would be your command
Kick me to the ground break both my bands
Every time your hurt me
I want you even more
I'll never win the battle and I'll never win the war
If I had an army
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

Every time I see you
Look me in the eye
I look straight back
'Cause a part of me will die
If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back

Look me in the eye

I think you'd remember
When you were so locked down
If you were a burden in a previous life.

Sleeping alone at the foot of your bed would
Give me a reason to worry at night.

I wasn't sure that all of my words could
Even try to hold the weight.

I ain't the kind to name names.

Someone has my heart.
Someone's not there.
Someone likes the jukebox.
Someone talks in tongues.
Someone wears a purple dress.
You make me laugh.
You know who you are.

And if you please I'll build you

And if you please I'll take you

And if you please I'll take you
out of the atmosphere that I

I wanted on my body a legion of your armies
to spread a canvas on me, to bury you upon me.

You came without a warning.

A message on my body.
A blessing on my body.

I saw it on your body;
In pink, in porcelain, Ivory.
The threads, a canvas awning.
I carry you upon me.

You came without a warning.

A message on my body.
A blessing on my body.

How many years have we waited for a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted chasing a love that was not our own?
I sat ashore and watched as one hopeless wave crashed upon another
While my thoughts ran to the highest hills my heart never, never reached the sea
With only delusions of an endless journey I am left with an ocean between you and me
An ocean between

Is this your salvation? Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection of someone else's dream

Yeah

The gate to my heart has been weld shut with the splendor of my aspirations closed in
How many years have we waited for a ship that never set sail?
And how many days have we wasted chasing a love that was not our own?
Is this your salvation?

Is this your salvation? Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection of someone else's dream

Is this your salvation? Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection of someone else's dream

How many days have we waited for a ship that never set sail?
How many years have we waited for a ship that never set sail?
How many days?
How many days have we waited for a ship that never, never set sail?
How many years have we waited for a ship that never, never set sail, never set sail?

Is this your salvation? Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection of someone else's dream

Is this your salvation? Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection of someone else's dream

I see them coming
With shrouds to bury us all
Before we were born they shaped our lives
Leading us into an unmarked grave
In moments life could end
So I will speak while I can

This is my chance
My time to stand

We may fail alone but that is better
Than dying with them only to be forgotten
I for one would rather suffer now
Than leave this life without passion

This is our chance
Our time to stand

You sat and watched
As I nearly destroyed myself
Never had I felt so betrayed
That you would sacrifice my life
For no more than your comfort.

And now your love means nothing, nothing to me,
Your love means nothing to me.
Nothing to me.

You are a coward the antithesis of a friend,
Take action before there is no one left to defend.

For I would have stood by you,
For I would have stood by you,
Right to the gates of hell.

For I would have stood by you,
Right to the gates of hell.
Right to the gates of hell.

I've looked straight into your eyes and turned my head for the last time
Because I was scared to leave these walls in ruin like the fate of those who trust in themselves
We are alone and afraid

I know YOU are the one we've left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
YOU're the one we've left behind

I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget YOU
YOU are the one we've left behind
YOU are the forsaken

Yeah

We've built our confidence on broken dreams now left for dead
Yet we've been condemned, yet we've been condemnde to chase these dreams that never end

I know YOU are the one we've left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
YOU're the one we've left behind
YOU're the one we've left behind

I will no longer turn my head

I will, I will no longer turn my head
I will, I will never forget YOU
YOU are, YOU are the one we've left behind

Our selfishness consumes us until the whole world is not enough
Forgive the day that I erased, that I erased YOUR name, that I erased YOUR name
For it's the memory of me that will decay

I know YOU are the forsaken

Take it back, this is a new day.
I never wanted and I never cared before.
Take it back, this is.

How I long to regress
To the days before I took upon myself
: The obsessions of this world
: A day of innocence equating beauty
: And tomorrow may fall
: And today is already gone
Tomorrow may fall
Today is already gone.

Take it back, this is a new day.
I never wanted, this is a new day.
And I never cared before.
I never wanted,

And I never cared before.

I've grown tired of chasing
Convinced I was in need
And now the years I've spent
Only a slave to this.
Tomorrow may fall
And today is already gone,
I will no longer adore
These things that will never satisfy me.

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came.

In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die.
In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die.
To die.

This world was never worthy but how can I call it unfaithful?
Every promise was fulfilled as decay crawled from its throat
Like the dead rising from an open grave
Like the dead rising from an open grave

Lips of splendor, tongue of deceit
All dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there's nothing left

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there's nothing left

Nothing left, nothing left
There's nothing left
Nothing left

If all my sorrow has led me here then I would cry all of my tears
To have this chance, to have this chance again
To have this chance, to have this chance
And know there's more than this and know there's more than you

To live based on the feeling of our hearts?

We speak of fighting to resist this world
But what about the battle within us? (Yeah)
If we have chosen to live against the grain
Then why are we all facing the same way?

There is no difference between us and them

I can only imagine that wrath is being held out
So there will be time for us to be redeemed
But surely wrath is not being held out
So that we may redeem ourselves
For I've seen the madness
Of those who died trying
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
I long to see their faces
Regardless of the decay
For in the eyes of the deceased...

We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still beauty
Inside this dying world

For what good is there holding off wrath
If we are determined
To bring wrath upon ourselves

Go!

The Truth of my heart
is like a repressed tale

A censored and silenced story
Repression or restraint
It is a delicate balance
Between bleeding out what
will make me drown
And closing in what I cannot afford to spill
Either way, I must cauterize, cauterize the open wound

I'm caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
or stuffed into a cell
or stuffed into a cell

And if these are the only options
This will be always be hell
Never ending
Though I still may be breathing
There is no quality of life
So I choose to risk it all for you
For you to be by my side

I'm caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
or stuffed into a cell
or stuffed into a cell

A crowd is easy to deceive
But now I am a patient on the table
I'll give you the knife
Cut away as you see fit
Just promise me the patience
To wait for me to heal


I'm caught between the feeling
Of being pulled apart
Or stuffed into a cell
Or stuffed into a cell
Or stuffed into a cell

Fighting so hard to be heard
Yet having nothing to say
You talk about changing masses
But forget those close to you

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

You can justify almost anything
If you are willing to be loud enough
But once you've spent everything
To change the world around you
Even if your voice is taken away
Such actions will still inspire

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

Now you've earned the right to be heard

We've been deceived by elegant speech
Whose only concern is mere distraction

Like a swarm of flies colliding with a moving windshield
So are our lives on this never-ending road
I have left behind my mark only to later be washed away
And was consumed with the allure despite the inevitable decay

When did the road that I'm on become my only home?
When did this become the one place I truly know?
(I truly know)

A journey making us like weeds
Where the wind steals our splendor
But spreads it to the distant fields
Despite our fragile imperfections
Yet shaking walls and wearing wheels
Can never capture my heart the way you do

When did the road that I'm on become my only home?
(my only home)
When did this become the one place I truly know?

I am missing what makes me whole

I fought who I am inside
Until I wanted, I wanted to die
Instead of finding balance I found hatred
Consumed by failures and ignoring my own strengths
Pushed out to sea without learning to swim
Or stranded in the desert with no lungs to breathe

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything

How can I be expected to readily be content
With a view of life that has rejected
The basis of what has helped me to survive?
And replaced them with precepts
Rather than instruction
Full rule is an illusion (illusion)
All I can do is contain selfishness
And unveil what little power we may have

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything (everything)

Tearing away my flesh before taking
The time to understand it
A miracle may not be the answer
(tearing away my flesh)
When anchoring first on what I have
(before taking the time to understand it)
The ability to change

Like being stranded in the desert
With no lungs to breathe

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything (everthing)

All these moments of pain
Must add up to something
Our bodies have been trained to keep it all in
But our hearts still hold on

Some say to release it, forget about your past
Instead we count the cost, it's part of us
That doesn't mean that we cannot move on
It's just a memory of what we once were

No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
We can overcome

Why rid of fuel that can make us stronger
When properly put behind us? (put behind us)
And in the same way that
Everything good in life can be taken away
So can all this pain

No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we've faced in this life
We can overcome

Trying to forget is a burden we can never bear
When facing trials openly
There's nothing left to hide
New paths of strength come alive

We can overcome

It's now part of us (part of us)
No matter what we've faced in this life
We can overcome

Your resilience inspires me
Facing tragedies I will never face
Your presence is humbling
To think of all that you have overcome
It took such little pain
For our lives to coalesce
Finding what I could've found in no one else

You bring me through the darkness of myself
And show me that frailty can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

From the outside I've deceived the world
With false bravery
Yet you have taught me so much more
Much more than I can ever teach
And someday you might
Need someone to lean on

I can only hope that I'll have gained the courage
To be there for you in whatever you face
You bring me trough (you bring me through)
The darkness of myself
And show me that frailty (can be turned)
Can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

At times I'm carried on the shoulders of a child
I find power in your firm fallibility
My source of hope is seeing that weak prevail
And I'm better able to live because you're alive
I could not imagine a world without you
Where I looked you in the eyes and left you to die

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

The storm is coming and I have a choice
To accept nature or lose my voice
Shall I scream and plead for nothing
Or build a roof over my head?
I mourn the days that I wasted
Trying to change what has been set
Fighting against myself

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I'll just admit they're part of me

I've labelled enemies who do not hate me
And then claims friends who could care less
All an unnecessary struggle
So now I know what it means to repent
Changing everything

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I'll just admit they're part of me
(they're part of me)

Instead of fighting against myself
I will open my eyes
To find who needs me
I am awakened

If simple honesty moves me, then why should I care?
Others may think I lost my poetic way (I've lost my way)
But I'd rather make my point without confusion

I have failed those who I love the most
And in the process become aware

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know
I have accepted my limitations

It is that knowledge that opens the door
For greater understanding
Perspective on what is still untold

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I'll never know
I have accepted my limitations

Sorting out my thoughts, that is why I write
Though I reveal my weakness surrendering is remedy
These songs have helped me though my greatest pain
Unwound within me the disorder of my life

I now see things for how they are
Even if that is a harsh reality

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I'll never know
I have accepted my limitations

There are days when sorrow seems never-ending
Like the countless roads upon which I've driven
The price of attachment in pursuit of dreams
That I so often can't seem to remember
Yet there are days when beauty cannot be contained
It even crawls out from under ordinary things

A foreigner, no place to go
Holding on, making the most
Of what little time I have

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret

I will not leave wishing I had done things differently

The moments I treasure are seldom the ones
That I planned for
And if I knew where pain hid I might still let it go
So when the audience has run toward the latest drift
It will be my time to face the life that I have set

A foreigner in my own home
Holding on, no place to go

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret (regret)
All the wasted words

Some days the line between peace
And pain seems more like a blur
But I know with certainty
I can't leave wishing, I cannot leave
I can't leave wishing I'd done things differently

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret (regret)
All the wasted words

There stopped being lines at all

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing

Each moment seemed so small
When looked at by itself
But it adds up
And it has torn me down
All lines are gone

The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was

So close the truth

It was never one thing

Fueled by faint deception
Conflict without acknowledging opposition

All because I had taken pride in my hidden lies

I decay from inside
From - in-side
Underneath it all there is still life
Despite it all there is still love

(to Stephanie for undying friendship)

did you ever see me
or could you even see at all
i looked at your cold white face
so still, so empty
yet i knew you were at rest
much more comforted than I
what else could i find to replace who you were
it was the carefree unrestricted love that you

never meant to give
you never had the choice,

it was your innocence
it was part of who you were
it was the comfort of a friend

The sound of silent voices surveying my thoughts
Regularity defining perfection
Neither sorrow nor contentment
Whispering emptiness.

Frail words collapse
My weight only stirs the ground
How long can I hold your hand as you walk over graves?

You search for tears of compassion
Yet find the comfort of winter
Reassurance dead like the falling leaves
Losing hope in your unchanging ways
All of my strength cannot save you
If you are unwilling to help yourself.

we tried so hard to understand and reason
but in that one moment i gave my heart away

Unraveled that tangles of my heart
All I felt was stale hollow air
These streams of uncertainty
They are all collapsing upon my mind
Torrents fill my veins until I burst
With mistaken guilt and shame
My battered bones

Puddles of ink
Surround this tired chair
All of my sorrow has been spilled
Into my reflection

If my commitments is only failure, is only failure

Each day I am born, I am born again to be, again to be
A child, a child in the eyes of love

Content to live with unrest
Longing faded into countless
Nights that buried my weary heart

But you brought an end to this dead hour
And meaning to a calloused life
Held in your arms but too far from my heart
Held in your arms but too far from my heart

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
Mine

I remember the way you looked
At me and the way you drew me close
With one deep sigh scattering
Pieces of my restless mind
Forgetting all that we have left behind

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in

Nothing more, more than You.
When first feelings fade,

I've tried to find reconciliation behind the walls of those whose hatred burns.
For I find it easier to reach someone who still feels,
Than to make amends with passionless apathy.
Where all lines are the same a portrait cannot be made.

I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive.

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.

Like a colorless sky over a sea of nothingness,
Hatred faces its enemies while apathy strikes furtively.

I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive.

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.
I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand...

Until our anger burns against injustice, we will create
The faceless by dismissing those forced to concede.

Many of us have turned off the light outside, erasing what exists beyond our front door.
And for you I find it harder to reach common ground than my most glaring opposition.
But what about those who've lost the luxury of choice?
...striving for identity, buried by our lack of interest, souls marked as mere history.
How much grievance will it take to awaken us?

I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger
Than indifference for those too weak to stand.
I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger

How much grievance will it take to awaken us from the comfort of our homes?

None of this matters, none of these words. Common and silent we will die in this world.
We've only spoken to those who agree, and without them we've fallen on deaf ears.

Stand on conviction and you will walk alone.

For once I have stood (I have stood), no one will know,
But alone I was born and alone we must go.

In my convictions I've found my own grave, but amongst the dead we all fade away.

Yeah...
Yet solitude is better than a life not worthy of reaction.
There is nothing to lose (nothing). So we stand alone or join those who follow in misery.

And without a crowd to feed that noise grows silent.

For once I have stood, no one will know, but alone I was born and alone we must go.
Fading back into an anodyne sea, to drown with all who've gone before me.

What we see now is only a fraction...

Bound to learn the hard way
This is the human condition
There is nothing that can be said
To stop us from making mistakes
When I look to myself as a source of ending pain
No matter how many times before I've failed

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond us to those truly in hell

The more I focus on myself
Then the more helpless that I become
So why not erase this point of view?
My suffering is trivial (Beyond our suffering)
Compared to those who know real agony

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering

My trials seem insignificant now

Why won't we look beyond us?
Why won't we look beyond our despair?
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look to those truly in hell

Personal redemption cannot change the world
Unless we lay down our lives for those who still suffer

Familiarity is the great deception, disguised by authority, sealing out subversion.

Whitewashed tombs have hidden the truth, for we unknowingly worship icons of ordinary life.

When there is none to be found right here before we die
So I understand the feeling of helplessness
When we are just taught to wait here, wait here for death

Wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end
Wait here for death, wait here for death

We are not forgotten, for a kingdom is offered beyond that of golden streets
We can represent now what will one day be complete

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned

Wait here for death, wait here for death
The "blessings" of excess are only a burden on us

It is a broken system where we just wait for death
It is a broken system where suffering can never end

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled

We've focused so long on ideals of freedom that it is this very belief that oppresses us.

There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

I've been so far gone for so long
And I can't keep my head up out the bottle
Holy fuck, why do I bother?
I'm never gonna get any better
I've waited so long to declare
"I don't give a fuck if I die today"
Holy shit, I've lost my mind
Reality is starting to unwind

Don't pray for me

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
There's nothing but pain left here I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Three years of torment and torturous love
Stained with tears and mistrust, enough is enough
I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in
'Cause your heart is too weak for me to break it again
All the mistakes that I've made
You forgave, what the fuck? You shouldn't have stayed
You'd always said "There's so much love in you"
I can't believe that you can't see that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left here I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Do you remember the beginning? Heartbeats one and the same?
Living smitten in Texas, burning bright as a flame
So young and in love, no care what anyone said
'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turned dead

What went so wrong with me? Why did I break this?
Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see
That we were perfect 'til I turned around
And gave in to debauchery
This is your chance to escape this
My goodbye with a last kiss
'Cause I know deep down you know that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left here I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left here I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

A boy of anguish now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him, no he won't let them go
Lays awake try'na find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

I can't believe I've come so far in such short time
And I'm still fighting on my own
If I stop to catch my breath I might never breathe again
So just know this
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I can't believe I let myself break down

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road

Imcompetent son of a bitch, keep your tongue tight
Cut your losses you're on thin ice so tread light
I don't wanna listen to your "he said, she said" shit
Keep your mouth shut and listen motherfucker
I can't stand this, it was never meant to be so hard
Satisfaction was supposed to come and ease my heart
I don't feel this anymore, I need to get away
All the love in my heart can't even find a way

These words they fall off my tongue like a poison
I hope they kill you all
I hope I never see your faces again
I wanna watch the whole world burn down
I wanna watch the world burn
I wanna watch the whole world burn down

I won't pretend I'm not disgusted with everything you are
I won't deny that I'm revolted by everything you say you stand for
Where do I go? What do I say? Where do I draw the line?
Can I move on? Can I let go before I lose my mind?
Am I alone after everything we've suffered through?
Feels though what once was us has dwindled down to me and you

These words they fall off my tongue like a poison
I hope they kill you all
I hope I never see your faces again
I wanna watch the whole world burn down
I wanna watch the world burn
I wanna watch the whole world burn down

This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free

Run free and wild, lose your mind, escape your inhibitions
Taste the wind, let your hair down and throw your hands up
Go, go, go, let go, forget the consequences
Go, go, go, let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world

This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free

Run free and wild, lose your mind, this world's yours for the taking
Open wide, scream it loud "This is my life"
Go, go, go, let go, forget what came before
Go, go, go, let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world

Close your eyes and pray for something bigger than this world has to give
Make it worth your time when you move on to whatever the hell is next
Know that you went in the end without a single regret
That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and followed your dreams

You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid
Run free and wild, let your heart soar with the eagles
Run free and wild, let your love take over
You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid

Am I insane? I ask myself over and over and over again
Flies in my brain pouring out from the cracks in my skull
Am I alone? Surrounded by sin and I think I might just be suffocating
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

Am I insane? I fold myself over and scream 'til I'm spitting blood
Flies in my brain the itching is incomprehensible and it won't stop
Am I alone? The voices grow fainted but they just won't fucking go away
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
Am I alone? Surrounded by death, I think this might just be the end
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

You can't take this away from me, you can't relieve these demons
You can't make this okay for me, you're the ones who caused these feelings
I apologize for what I'm about to do
I tried to sympathize but at the end of the day you brought this on yourselves

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

The tears have left a blur that I can't explain
The pain has left a hole in which my heart should have been
I'm blind with rage and I can't shake this feelings
Irrational, impetuous, intemperate

I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

Street signs, so many street signs pass me by every night and
I know tomorrow I won't recognize the world
Home bound, but I want to be home now
Two more months of empty faces standing there screaming up at me
And I don't know why

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road

Save me, can anyone save me?
I don't know who I am anymore
This was supposed to be the dream
You don't see the pain in my eyes?
You don't hear the pain in my words?
I'm just stuck here cold and alone with no one beside me
And I wanna go home

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road

And you wonder why I'm out of my mind?

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road

As I breathe my disease brings me to my knees
All you need is a taste, it'll set you free
Your infection's my discretion honey, one and the same
Counting second 'til I'm medicated, fucked in the brain

I don't want this baby, I just need it to carry on

I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in

I sold my soul

Licking every drop of poison off a pocket of keys
While some daddy's little angel's getting dirt on her knees
When the sun goes down, the filth roam free
You'll never find a finer specimen of filth than me

I don't want this, I just need this to carry on

I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in

I sold my soul

Some have said that I'm the devil and it's just as well 'cause
I've been through and burned down and rebuilt hell
With my heart in a vice and a knife in my back
I've got a noose for the world that I'm painting black

I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell then baby count me in

If you could see my soul as I have seen my soul

Help me, please

Please, give me a fucking excuse
I beg for just one reason to give you regret, regret

Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side, so choose your side
Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side, so choose your fucking side

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away

Hear me now
Get off your knees
Nothing changes when you pray
I'm the closest thing to a God you'll ever know
Get off your knees
Open your eyes

I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you

I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you

And I can't feel this pain anymore
And I can't carry on this way
I'm hiding behind false eyes

I'm so done with it, I won't go back again and
I'm okay with this, that I'll be on my own
Until the day I die, which shouldn't be that long
So I'll just do what I do and make the most of it

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive
Made it out alive

Oh fuck, this is fun I just can't believe
I didn't find this before
To just indulge even if it kills me
Who gives a fuck if we die?

Who gives a fuck if we die?
Who gives a fuck if we die?

Another bottle down

You should really try it sometime
'Cause it feels so good

You should really try it sometime
'Cause it feels so good

Without a care if a heart gets broken
You'll all learn in the end, there's a better way
Baby move in closer, you couldn't hurt me if you tried

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

Take a seat, my dear
Make yourself comfortable, this could take a while
Crack another, dear
I can't see now and I wouldn't change a thing
Life should burn with such a fucking flame
If not you've only got yourself to blame

Get the fuck away from me

I know that I have done wrong and continue to do so but without remorse
I know that I am on a fast track to the grave and I'm headed there alone

I struggle to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man with a conscience
I fight to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man that is not me

I spend my days looking through pages
Try to find a way to get away from me
A love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find a way back inside my mind

I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you save yourself

Yeah

I spend my days looking through pages
Try to find a way to get away from me
A love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find a way back inside my mind

I need to find
A way back inside my mind
I need to find
A way back inside my mind

This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end

Every mistake I've made leaves a scar that burns every day
Yet still I carry on
Without regret without remorse, I'm gone
You're better off to walk away
I am corruption, I am sin

Forget my name
Forget my face
Forget my name
Forget my face

Go

We're back again, you know we're not fucking around
Got a bottle of jack in our hands, you tryna' keep up kid?
Let's see who hits the ground
We've drank the drinks, we've done the drugs, clearly we don't remember
We've come so far, we've shown them all, without us you'd fall and fade away

They say it all breaks down to keeping your feet on the ground
My sole intention is keeping my head in the clouds
They say that I can't last a day in the real world
I say you wouldn't survive one night in mine

Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit

Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit

You can't help but love this shit

I'm everything we need to make this scene what it should have been
Remember platinum albums, sold out stadiums, leave it to me
Let's tell the truth, not to be rude but we're all irrelevant
This music's dead with a bullet in its head
Let's wake it up

Their wine subdues me

Something more than just... "Goodbye"

It's hard to remember the good times when there's just so much heartache
But they deserve more than that
They deserve more than just one single moment of sadness

So just remember that when there's enough love in our hearts
To burst like a fucking supernova
And there sure as hell's enough love in our heart to spark that famous smile

We all lose someone at some point in our lives
But don't ever let go of that smile

Hold on forever

So he came forth and said unto me
Son, you are forsaken
Condemned for the sins that you live
I offer you forgiveness

Bow down before me
Bow down before me

I'll never bow to he who claims to be divine
I'll tear down your gates with bare fucking hands
And burn the world that you rule over
No matter how convinced you are, you're not a god of mine
You're not a fucking god of mine

I never believed in you
From what I see it was justified
I never believed in you

This power over the masses is a gift you don't deserve
When your blood spills, we'll drink from your skull
You can run, you can hide

Bitch
I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your eyes out of your self-righteous face

Lord
I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your tongue out of your rancid fucking mouth

Heaven will burn to the fucking ground
Your world will crumble, and fall from the skies
Blood will spill, and rain upon the Earth
Your reign is over, and I'll wear your crown

This is your demise
I know you feel it in your chest
This is your demise
It's getting closer
This is your demise
I'm creeping from the depths of hell
This is your demise
I know where you sleep

I never believed in you
From what I see it was justified
I never believed in you
In you

What a way to end the world

With false hope in a false god
What a way to end the world

Through sin and self-destruction I stumble home, never alone
My only home is the bottom of a bottle and a rolled up bill and I'm ready to go
I live the same day in and out and I don't care how long I last
All the girls and drink and drugs, but don't get me wrong
I'm having a fucking blast

I am rock and roll
Living a life you can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt

Not gonna stop until my heart stops beating
Not gonna stop until my last breath comes

Pass me a glass and let's destroy everything in this fucking place

I'll be the end of her, I'm in her head and in control

The floor's all yours, the house is full
You've made the slip now take the fall
I pull your strings, you're too deep in
So will she sink or swim?

Ladies and gentlemen
Place your fucking bets
Here we come

Oh, she's down, how very spectacular
What a work of art I've spawned
Man am I proud of myself on this one

She's such a fucking masterpiece
Self-destruction is such a pretty little thing

I know that I should walk away
But I can't bring myself to quit this game
She's just a beautiful girl
With the weight of the world on her shoulders
I'm just a kick in the teeth
From a world that's painted gold

Turn the fucking tables

Keep it down, honey hush your lips
Clothes trailing from the backdoor to the bedroom
And I don't even know your name (Hoe!)
Give me all you've got
Make this night worth my time
Make this worth my time
Oh what I would give to live this night again
I knew when I first saw you
You'd fuck like a whore
That this would be a night to remember
Hope they hear you screaming for more

Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison
They bring you to your knees
Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison
They bring you to your knees
(Oh, c'mon)

Girl get down
It's almost over
Take it all the way
You stupid fucking whore
And after all of all my dreaming being only you
You're standing there baby
Oh,the things that I could do
Back to the wall with a drink in my hand
Back it up, baby ride, ride, ride

One step too late and I never told you
That I can't take another disappointment
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
One step too late and I never told you
That I can't take another disappointment
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending.

(Danny!)

With your back against the wall, with your face buried in the pillow
I see you cold, I feel you heartless

Bitch, you stupid fucking bitch
You stupid fucking bitch

(Fuckin' bitch!)

Like the haunting chants and prayers to which I've never listened
thou shalt no longer live in chains or ever be imprisoned.
Ease my always throbbing heart, I shall no longer falter
as pupae to imagines all images must alter.

Let thy glory shine on me, disperse my obfuscation,
hide thy essence in myself, I need assimilation.
Stream thyself into my soul and flood it with thy yearning,
pour thy soul into my shell, erase my restless burning.

I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices in my head, echoing.

I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.

Du hast die Augen aufgeschlagen, kannst das Licht doch nicht ertragen,
wie um die Schmerzen fortzujagen, schlägst du nach dem Neonstrahl.
Selbst die Luft schmeckt dir verrußt, denn ganz egal, was du auch tust, wenn
du sie atmest, mußt du husten. Hättest du nur eine Wahl!

Von überall drängt an die Ohren ein beständiges Rumoren,
und du fühlst dich so verloren, und du wünscht dich ganz weit weg.
Deine Haut beginnt zu jucken, deine Augen stark zu zucken.
Willst dich in die Schatten ducken, doch du findest kein Versteck.

Viele längst vergess'ne Geister
heißen dich willkommen
in der eisigen Wirklichkeit!
Alle Ängste mitgereist, wer
hat sie mitgenommen,
in die eisige Wirklichkeit?

So viele Jahre war dein Streben, all dein Tun und Worte Weben
auf ein großes, neues Leben in der Freiheit konzentriert.
Nun bist du endlich obenauf, denn alles schien so gut gelaufen,
war es teuer nicht erkauft, wenn dich am Ende wieder friert?

Viele längst vergess'ne Geister
heißen dich willkommen
in der eisigen Wirklichkeit!
Alle Ängste mitgereist, wer
hat sie mitgenommen,
in die eisige Wirklichkeit?

In der eisigen Wirklichkeit!
In der eisigen Wirklichkeit!

Liebende Kinder, gebt fein acht,
dass keiner dieses mit euch macht...
Herzensfeuer, Abenteuer sind so spielend leicht entfacht.
Übermäßig schön gefräßig, aufgezehrt und aufgewacht.
Mit bloßen Händen abzuwenden trachtest du mit aller Macht,
schürfen, schütten, schürfen, schütten, in den tiefen Seelenschacht.

Durch Raum und Zeit hör ich dich rufen
durch den endlos grauen Tag,
den wir bekämpften und doch schufen,
dem ich tausendfach erlag.

Man kann sich niemals mehr umarmen, selbst wenn man erfriert.
Das Leben zeigt doch kein Erbarmen, wenn man's doch riskiert.

Rücken an Rücken.
Wenn man ständig kämpft, damit es weiter geht.
Rücken an Rücken.
Sich auswendig kennt und doch kein Wort versteht,
Rücken an Rücken.
Wie soll man sich so denn in die Augen sehn
- Rücken an Rücken -
und, solang man kann, vergeben und dann gehn,
aus freien Stücken?

Unser Atem schwebt ins Leere
und der Kuss bleibt nur gedacht.
Weil ich dir den Rücken kehre,
bereit für eine neue Schlacht.

Wie ich nach deinen Augen giere, füll mein Vakuum!
Selbst wenn ich den Halt verliere, dreh dich bitte um!

Rücken an Rücken.
Wenn man ständig kämpft, damit es weiter geht.
Rücken an Rücken.
Sich auswendig kennt und doch kein Wort versteht,
Rücken an Rücken.
Wie soll man sich so denn in die Augen sehn
- Rücken an Rücken -
und, solang man kann, vergeben und dann gehn,
aus freien Stücken?

Der Rettungsplan, ich kam dich holen.
So, wie ich gelobte!
Wir haben uns der Welt gestohlen,
wenn der Sturm auch tobte.
Vom Regen in die Traufe.
Flohen, dachten, es kann glücken.

Hand in Hand davongelaufen,
und von da an standen wir:

Rücken an Rücken.
Wenn man ständig kämpft, damit es weiter geht.
Rücken an Rücken.
Sich auswendig kennt und doch kein Wort versteht,
Rücken an Rücken.
Wie soll man sich so denn in die Augen sehn
- Rücken an Rücken -
und, solang man kann, vergeben und dann gehn,
aus freien Stücken?

Du siehst betörend aus und wieder wie geleckt,
so eingepellt in Lack und Leder.
Die spitzen Schuhe hast du lange schon versteckt,
ich kratz und kitzle mit der Feder.

Der Geist, so flüchtig aber nicht dein alter Duft,
gefangen, wo die Lippen blühen.
Ergründe niemals alle Ecken deiner Gruft,
ich kann mich also noch so sehr bemühen.

Schön, schön, schön,
ich weiß, ich hab dich nicht verdient.
Schön, schön, schön,
ich weiß, ich hab dich nicht verdient,
nicht verdient.

Wenn ich dir näher kam, kam ich nie nah genug.
Ich sondre Schleim ab bis ich triefe.
Ich war dir viel zu zahm, und war es Selbstbetrug?
Denn niemals drang ich in die Tiefe.

Noch immer winsle ich und wedle mit dem Schwanz,
doch stetig schickst du deine Wächter.
Die schmücken sich mit aufgesetzter Toleranz
und sind doch immer etwas echter.

Schön, schön, schön,
ich weiß, ich hab dich nicht verdient.
Schön, schön, schön,
ich weiß, ich hab dich nicht verdient,
nicht verhaßt.

Hast du dich vielleicht ein bißchen zu sehr eingeschnürt?
Willst du noch Hilfe oder bist du längst verloren?
Hast mich herzlich oft an deiner Leine vorgeführt,
drum lass ich dich auch gern im eignen Saft verschmoren.
Und doch: Ich schnitte dich behutsam aus deinem Korsett,
kochtest du dich nicht selbst in deinem eignen Süppchen.
Ach, wenn ich doch ein gut gewetztes, scharfes Messer hätt!
Ich helf doch gern und wo ich kann, mein kleines Püppchen.

Wenn du mich brauchst, dann bin ich buchstäblich schon da,
du bist das G, Punkt! Ich bin SP, Komma A.

Nur mit der Maske fühlst du dich ganz unmaskiert,
und der Gesichter hast du viele.
Die meisten find ich schön, doch wär ich bald kastriert,
blieb ich bei dir und spielte Spiele.

Schön, schön, schön,
ich weiß, ich hab dich nicht verdient.
Schön, schön, schön,
ich weiß, ich hab dich nicht verdient,
nicht verdient.

Ich steige auf, du sinkst hinab,
durch unsre zweisam tief geträumten Träume.
Erinnre dich, was ich dir gab!
Wir schickten Wünsche durch die Zwischenräume.
Wir sind ein Kind und doch uralt.
Wir tauschten stetig Weck- und Wiegenlieder
und tasten staunend durch den Spalt,
vom Stimmenklang gelockt kann keiner wider-
stehen.

Das Innerste geäußert und aufs Äußerste verinnerlicht.
Ein Wechselbalg, die Welt getauscht und nun werden wir sehen.

Du hast dich den Kräften, die so an dir zerrten,
doch mit aller Macht
noch entgegengestellt,
dich gewehrt
und dagegengestemmt.
Der Weg in die Freiheit blieb wieder versperrt, denn
dann bist du erwacht
in der anderen Welt,
so verkehrt,
und so unendlich fremd.

Ich sah das Licht, du sahst mein Herz,
und bald schon packte Furcht die beiden Seelen;
trieb uns dahin, nur kummerwärts,
wir sollten uns unsagbar viel erzählen.
Zu zweit entlarvt als Teufelsbrut;
die Attraktion verblasst nach der Enthüllung.
Was du dir wünschst, bedenke gut!
Denn manches Mal, da kann es in Erfüllung
gehn.

Das Innerste geäußert und aufs Äußerste verinnerlicht.
Ein Wechselbalg, die Welt getauscht und nun werden wir sehen.

Du hast dich den Kräften, die so an dir zerrten,
doch mit aller Macht
noch entgegengestellt,
dich gewehrt
und dagegengestemmt.
Der Weg in die Freiheit blieb wieder versperrt, denn
dann bist du erwacht
in der anderen Welt,
so verkehrt,
und so unendlich fremd.

Nicht mehr allein, für den Moment,
doch viel zu kurz auf unsren langen Wegen.
Wir kommen zu uns ganz getrennt,
wo uns die Winde klirrend kalt entgegen-
sehen.

Das Innerste geäußert und aufs Äußerste verinnerlicht.
Ein Wechselbalg, die Welt getauscht und nun werden wir sehen.

Du hast dich den Kräften, die so an dir zerrten,

Am Tage Kraft für das Getriebe
Und nachts da geb ich euch mein Wort
Fragen sind wie Raben Diebe
Sie fliegen ohne Beute fort

Komm sprich mir nach, lern sie benutzen
Und präg sie dir aufs Schärfste ein
Zwölf von euch gehen auf ein Dutzend
Doch Meister kann nur einer sein

Mein ist das Wort und das Wort ist das Wissen.
Das Wissen ist Macht und Macht ist entrissenes Recht...

Denn ich bin dein Meister
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Ja, ich bin dein Meister
Und du bist nichts
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Ja, ich bin dein Meister
Und du bist nichts
Nichts als mein Knecht!

Nun kommt herbei ihr Mühlenknaben
Denn Mitternacht ist Füttrungszeit
Los, pickt das Wort in kleinen Happen
und lernt im schwarzen Federkleid

Du kriechst mir nach, du kannst auch rennen
Und doch holst du mich niemals ein
Denn Wissen kann wie Feuer brennen
Zu viel davon kann tödlich sein

Mein ist das Wort und das Wort ist das Wissen.
Das Wissen ist Macht und Macht ist entrissenes Recht...

Denn ich bin dein Meister
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Ja, ich bin dein Meister
Und du bist nichts
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Ja, ich bin dein Meister
Und du bist nichts
Nichts als mein Knecht!

Mit meinen Worten schaff ich Fesseln härter als Metall
- Denn du bist der Meister
'S gibt keine Orte zum Verstecken, ich bin überall
- Denn du bist der Meister
Du bist dir nicht so recht im Klaren, welchen Preis zu zahlst
- Denn du bist der Meister
Nur ich alleine kenn die Wahrheit, wie die Mühle mahlt
- Denn du bist der Meister
Und du findest nie und nimmer einen Weg hinaus
- Denn du bist der Meister
Gleich wie du dich schindest, immer einen Schritt voraus
- Denn du bist der Meister

Denn ich bin dein Meister
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Ja, ich bin dein Meister
Und du bist nichts
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Denn ich bin dein Meister
Ja, ich bin dein Meister
Und du bist nichts
Nichts als mein Knecht!

Denn ich bin dein Meister

Gehorche der Stimme
Des Meisters, gehorche ihr
Gehorche der Stimme
Des Meisters, gehorche ihr

Ich bin des Meisters Ruf gefolgt
Die Stimme zog mich magisch an
Das heis're Rufen in der Nacht
Im Traum schlug mich in seinen Bann
Endlich öffne ich mit klammer
Schweißbenetzter Hand die Tür
Zur geheimen, schwarzen Kammer
Und der Meister spricht zu mir
Er fragt mich: "Was soll ich dich lehren?"
"Müllern und das and're auch"
Er streckt mir seine Linke hin
Ich schlage ein, so ist es Brauch

Und mir sprießen Rabenfedern
Und so flieg ich unerkannt
Über Grenzen in das Leben
Wie der Wind schnell über's Land
Und ich breche alle Regeln
Um heut' Nacht bei dir zu sein
Fühl mein Rabenherz, es schlägt so
Schnell und nur für dich allein

Schenk dir eine Rabenfeder
Uns'rer Liebe Unterpfand
Denk an mich, ich komme wieder
Denk an mich, hältst du sie in der Hand

Gehorche der Stimme
Des Meisters, gehorche ihr
Gehorche der Stimme
Des Meisters, gehorche ihr

Er spricht: "Ja, nun gehörst du mir
Mit Haut und Haaren bist du mein"
Ich wollte fliehen voller Furcht
Sein Blick fährt mir durch Mark und Bein
Mit einem Auge nun erfasst er
Dich, du willst vor Angst vergehen
Das and're unter einem Pflaster
Schwarz und kann doch alles seh'n
Ich komme mir so schrecklich nackt vor
Zauberspruch um Zauberspruch
Liest er uns vor aus dem Koraktor
Weiße Schrift im schwarzen Buch

Und mir sprießen Rabenfedern
Und so flieg ich unerkannt
Über Grenzen in das Leben
Wie der Wind schnell über's Land
Und ich breche alle Regeln
Um heut' Nacht bei dir zu sein
Fühl mein Rabenherz, es schlägt so
Schnell und nur für dich allein

Schenk dir eine Rabenfeder
Uns'rer Liebe Unterpfand
Denk an mich, ich komme wieder
Denk an mich, hältst du sie in der Hand

Wo bist du nur hingeflogen?
Überall sucht dich sein Blick
Hab den Kreis um uns gezogen
Doch es zieht mich schon zurück
Hör die Stimme deines Meisters
Gehorche, denn er kriegt dich doch
Er wird dich finden und du weißt es
Nur mein Herz ruft lauter noch
Nach dir

Und mir sprießen Rabenfedern
Und so flieg ich unerkannt
Über Grenzen in das Leben
Wie der Wind schnell über's Land
Und ich breche alle Regeln
Um heut' Nacht bei dir zu sein
Fühl mein Rabenherz, es schlägt so
Schnell und nur für dich allein

Schenk dir eine Rabenfeder
Uns'rer Liebe Unterpfand
Denk an mich, ich komme wieder

Seven days; the time for one beat of the divine heart.
Not a second more before being deprived of his immortality;

I saw the reflection of the hellfire
With my own eyes
I do whatever feels right
It comes at a high price

In this game you die the moment you freeze
But always remember
When we've overcome our fears
We'll truly be free

Getting closer
We're getting closer

Go

We'll reach the goal
Getting closer

It's a thrill, it's a rush, it's a suicide pill
A beggar on a corner tells me about Jesus
While a skeleton in a fur coat
Being driven in a limousine

We all live for that perfect moment
Dangerous, it's so much fun
Cause when you've woken up you see
When you've woken up you see

Erase your face

I get out of the house and walk towards the station
It's dark, deserted, I'm feeling lonely but connected
Every move is being recorded and I know it
But my anger is a gift
And my biggest secret is that I actually stopped existing

I'm surprised how indifferent so many feel about the surveillance scandal
Look up Germany's history
I have spoken to people who lived in Nazi and eastern socialist Germany
The spying on your life by the state is one thing but what it does to your friends and family in the long run is beyond anything you can imagine right now
You lose trust in people you love, every conversation becomes half lie / half truth
It becomes part of everybody's lives
Nobody is an exception
Ignore music, games or whatever you do right now and research the topic
Anything you have said in the past can be twisted against you in a surveillance state
Made the wrong joke in private?
You are constantly being blackmailed by those in charge
History has shown that these types of societies never last
They get so corrupted with lies that many people will suffer in the end
Everybody loses

Organized puppets fools, fiction on a screen
Lost in the freedom we found
Greed and control, cameras on everything

The watching eye, government spies
Paid to tell lies and in the end who wins
Pow so it all falls down

Hell on earth
Man created the devil and the devil created the excuse
To justify the killings
That we don't see on the news
And I wonder: Will history repeat itself?
When they're numbering you

They'll try to hurt you
Through the good they see in you
Don't let it break you
Don't let it break you

They'll try to punish you
For the good they see in you
They know they need it
Don't let it break you

Knock, knock mocking bird stop bang
And another one's down
Fuck your 2 seconds and we lay down flat
Face to the ground, face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we'd be face to the ground
Face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we'd be face to the ground
So we can't back down

But we say that computers are controlled by men

Stuck by the news, it's hard to hear a fucking sound
They're kicking down the doors and taking everyone down
And I know for sure that I can't trust you anymore
A history in violence and they're coming for some more

Public enemies as far as you can see
They're loading their guns and marching the streets
A flag with no meaning, a religion of deceit
You can't arrest the idea

New blood
End of the dark night clouds clear run free

New blood
No more waiting, don't buy what they're saying

New blood
What the hell are they talking about
Stuck in a rut and we must get out

New blood
Too much is at stake

High tech, low life, digits without numbers
I'm sick of running
I see the masses without people
And I know for sure that I can't trust it anymore

Governments pointing guns at their own people
It has come that far
Invent your god, praise a lie
You can't arrest the idea

New blood
There's too much at stake, way too much at stake

New blood
Run free

New blood
Don't buy into what they're saying

New blood
Attack, run, go

We live in a decade
Where violence breeds more violence
Destructive forces are at work
It's time to ask yourself the question:
Do you still own your future?
And do you sometimes just want to start all over again?
Reset

Atari Teenage Riot is ready to go

When they try to drag you down
And you are on your own
Hook it up and press "Reset"
Hook it up and press "Reset"
Reset, Reset

Don't give up the world
To those you despise
Cause when we're finished
Discouragement will be gone
Your mind is a weapon
So don't waste more time

Never fit in
Stay under radar
Mix with the crowd
Be a shadow

Format everything
Know your enemy
Restart everything

Many of us live in a world of pure hype
And you know you're right
When haters make shit up that is not true
They justify their hate
Because they can't attack you otherwise

You're lucky when no one thinks you're rich
We can't help who our parents are
You know that as well as I do
But it's what we do from this point on
That will define us, that will define us

You hold the key

Two halves can make a whole
Aren't we all the genetic product
Of two completely different people?
We all hold the key to it all
A lot of money or a lot of meaning

I've been standing here for 55 minutes
Waiting for the air to get cold
I can't even notice a slight variation
Of pressure is pressure is pressure
You hold the key

First they invented their own gods
Then they followed them blindly
As if they had no responsibility or control over their own lives
Some hide behind the drugs
Crawl back into their bottles
To see people be dragged down like that
Feels like a bullet tear a chunk out of you shoulder you know

Transducer
Intercept

Standing on a rooftop, staring down
The sound of a helicopter approaches from far away
Traffic below, stars above

They call me transducer
Transducer

They wanna take me out, out, out, out
I got the identity of another man
A copy of a man of a copy

Stranded, it couldn't drive me insane
I jump into the big unknown
I feel like I'm drowning
It couldn't drive me insane

Darkness would end this life
But I'm still falling
Lights, flashing lights
Is this death?

When nobody knows your face
Or knows who you are
There are no re restrictions to who you can be

You are the one

Don't let them tell you you're nothing
Because you know it isn't true

You matter not because of who you once were
Or where you came from
You matter because of who you are in this moment

You control your convictions, character and values
You as an individual, you matter
They frame you, they limit you
Before you can take your chance

Become plenty
When you're anonymous, no mob can find you
Discriminate against you, bully or segregate you

Ich stehe hier alleine
Von Zuhause weggerannt
Alle Ampeln sind auf rot
In dieser Stadt, in diesem Land

Doch wo nur soll ich hingehen?
Ne' Wohnung hab ich nicht
Am besten in die nächste Kneipe
Und dort besauf' ich mich

Zuhause gibt's nur Ärger
Zoff und Streit und Zank
Meine Alten malochen in der Fabrik
Kein dickes Konto auf der Bank

Im Betrieb ham' sie mich gekündigt
Ich hatte vor dem Mund kein Blatt
Und jetz' stehe ich hier
Es ist Abend in der Stadt

Verdammt, in dieser Strasse
Steh'n soviel Häuser leer
Und die Besitzer verdienen am Verfall
Noch viel, viel mehr
Die Kälte lässt mich frieren
Die Jacke hält den Wind nicht ab
Heut muss was passieren
Es ist Abend in der Stadt

Also los zu meinen Freunden
Wie immer ins feuchte Eck
Die Häuser müssen bewohnt sein
Das ist doch ihr Zweck

Und wir wollen nicht länger bitten
Haben die Behörden satt
Heute ziehen wir in die Häuser ein
Es ist Abend in der Stadt

Also los, rein ins erste Haus
Mensch, wie das hier verfällt
Wir haben unsere Träume
Und das ist wichtiger als Geld
Wir wollen zusammen leben
Und nicht in 'nem Schließfach
das 'nen Wohnklo hat
Wir werden renovieren
Es ist Abend in der Stadt!

Was passiert da draußen?
Polizei marschiert
Der Oberbulle ließt 'ne Erklärung vor
Die Politiker haben das geschmiert
Die Politiker vertreten die Spekulanten
Und lügen dabei glatt
Wenn das Recht ist und Gesetzt
Ja dann scheiß ich drauf
Es ist Abend in der Stadt

Also los, Barrikaden gebaut
Verteidigen wir unser Recht
Unser Recht keine Stiefel im Gesicht zu haben
Die Mollis brennen nicht schlecht
Der Staat zeigt seine Zähne
Und wir sorgen für Zahnausfall
Wir werden uns wehren
Wir ergeben uns in keinem Fall

Politiker, wenn Ihr den Krieg haben wollt
Dann säht nur weiter Wind
Der Sturm kommt zu Euch zurück
Wenn wir wieder ohne Wohnung sind
Dann besetzen wir Eure Villen
Und die Deutsche Bank
Und den deutschen Reichstag
Und dann ist's morgen rot im Land

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"

For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
"Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"

We are the ghosts of the midway
The beasts of the alley
We are the living dead
Living in your nightmares

Scraping ourselves from the earth
Living as though we are dirt
Staring like you've seen a ghost
The lowest of the low with nowhere to go

Back from the dead, now we're groveling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets
Back from the dead, now we're groveling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets

Fighting for your attention, begging for your generosity
Looking up just to see you turn your cheek on me
You walk on by like I'm invisible, invisible
All I want is to be seen as an equal

We fought your battles and we built your homes
Sorry if I disturbed you, I just wish we could live like you do

Even in our most beautiful days it's dark
Just look at the world around you
There's a consequence for what we do
Pass judgment on me as you walk
Picture perfect ain't my obsession
You can't sum up my life from a first impression

Learn your lesson

Act like you know me but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
Act like you know me but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose

I may have no one else to blame (But listen to me)
You and I, we were once the same (The same)

Do you know how it feels to hide
With thoughts repressed deep down inside?
I guess you just loved the lie
Truth is, you can't decide where my heart resides

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
And cast aside from the man that I am

I've never felt so free
It kills me to hear you say you "choose to love me"
I was hoping that would be a given, given our history
I've never felt so free, so free

You think I'm wrong, you think I'm wrong
But I never felt better

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better
Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better

I know I disappointed you
But I've got nothing to prove

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
But now I've realized this is who I am
I've made my decision, you're either with or against me

You're either with or against me
You're either with or against me

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie

I'm standing firm, it's who I am
You can't keep me, you can't keep me down
I'm moving on, I'm living free
You can't stop me, you can't stop me now

These windy streets tell of a different time
What got us here won't get us there
It's time for the upright to have insight
Don't forget what's important in life
This place is like a cage that will imprison you
Is comfort only found without adversity?
Anyone, anywhere in history, has confronted these realities

What got us here won't get us there
I'll be there soon that's why I care

Everyone you love will one day fade away
Everything you have will rot and decay
Everything around us will burn
Burn up in the death of the sun

It's in the pain that we see our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we are defined
When we're blind we will feel our true selves change
In the sea of difficulty we leave our comfort behind

We are found in far away places, when all seems lost
We are found in far away places, not all is lost

We must be strong and cling onto hope (Cling onto hope)
We must be strong, when the ground is shifting out from under our feet

We are found in far away places when all seems lost
We are found in far away places when all seems lost

Stop majoring in the minors
It's when you get inside that is widens
Stay true tempered (Stay true tempered)
You're not the first to find life is tough

Circumstantial hope isn't really hope
It's just a watered down distraction from what stands in our way
Hope gives us the ability to face reality
The ability to see through it all

Demand what you will never deserve
Respect is gained by trust shown and earned
Don't mask your pride with humility
While forcing others to keep proving their loyalty

You've been a hypocrite for years
Drawing swords as much as you draw their tears
Demand what you will never deserve
Respect is gained by trust shown and earned

You build your strength off of your anger
Fighting a selfish battle with no answer
Your transparency has started showing
Don't let fear guide you where you are going

You would die for everyone else
But you won't live for yourself

Do you mean what you say?
Do you say what you mean
Or will you find another lie
Another lie to hide behind?
Keep speaking to the world about
What you can't forget
You can't forget all the things you hold onto
Refusing to forgive those that hurt you

You're taking steps on a fine line
So you don't have to choose a side
Good deeds are not recognized
When the heart's intent is full of pride

You're taking steps on a fine line
So you don't have to choose a side

And learn to let go and forgive (Forgive)

Wipe away the filth, set fire to your waste
Burn everything, back into dirt

Flood, drown the earth

Rehash the poisons, you breathe in the air
Tear down what you say your Father created
Constructing buildings over buildings
Conceal history like a shameful scar
This world has lived for a million years with more to come
It's only a matter of time until you choke on your indifference
Struggling to breathe as the water fills your lungs
Trying hard to scream as it rises into your throat

The reckless, the careless
Will reign until the oceans rise

Flood, drown the earth

Wake up, save yourself
Pick up the pieces, ask for forgiveness

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away

I can't live a lie, running for my life

Another star has fallen without sound
Another spark has burned out in the cold
Another door to the barren standing open
And who is there to tell me not to give in, not to go?

How could I know, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever
How could I know, how could I see?
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down the doorway to the badlands
Been kicking down all your hurdles to the black
And all the damage fading in the rear-view mirror
And the demons are calling me
They're dragging me away

How could I know, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever
How could I know, how could I see?

Lost in space, lost in time
Lost in space, lost in time

Before the story begins, is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine until the end of time?
We were more than friends before the story ends
And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you.

I almost laughed myself to tears
Conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here, you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it

She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in

It goes on and on and on
And I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby don't cry

Possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it
(Eat the shit out of him)

Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must return back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
Cause I was all up in a piece of Heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby don't cry

(What will you do?)
I will suffer for so long
(Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, if it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

Coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
Yes, I do

Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
I do
I now pronounce you..

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah

Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here - so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

I see a distant light
But girl this can't be right...
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here!

Place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here - so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time... (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay
I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here!
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might, take me back inside
When the time is right!

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy!)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live!)

Aah!

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right, to move on and on
Far away from here!
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might, take me back inside

I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways, and that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face, I may have forced the scale to tip

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me, It's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, It's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
It's hard to face but the fact remains, that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin, but deep inside I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again, it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall)
Come back again, it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right
(Make it alright)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane

I need that shot to enter my vein

Yeah

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

So how does it feel to know that someone's kid in the heart of America
Has blood on their hands, fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain a lifestyle that insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute, we aim high in the air
Towards all the pompous assholes who spend their days pointing fingers
(Fuck you)

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your generous hypocrisy
Collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you've dug your own grave)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

All the way from the east to the west, we got this high society
Looking down on that very foundation, constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems, pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing to the country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see, try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
Can't help but wish that I was there
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person
Who can be true to you
But I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

There's nothing here for me
On this barren road
There's no one here
While the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of
The times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories
Will have to help me through
Oh yeah

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person
Who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade.

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person
Who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again oh no
Once again

Yeah, you've been alone
I've been gone for far too long
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

Never let it show
The pain I've grown to know
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah

'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

Letters keep me warm
Helped me through the storm
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I've always been true
I've waited so long just to come hold you

I'm making it through
It's been far too long, we've proven our
love over time's so strong, in all that we do
The stars in the night, they lend me their light
to bring me closer to heaven with you

(Bring me closer)

But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

And with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

Centuries pass and still the same
War in our blood
Some things never change
Fighting for land and personal gain
Better your life, justify our pain
The end is knocking
The end is knocking

We've all been lost
For most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn
More hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of
Us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps
Being led by pride

How many lives will we take?
How many hearts, destined to break?
Nowhere to run, can't escape
Full of ourselves, tied to our fate
The end is knocking
The end is knocking
Yeah

We've all been lost
For most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn
More hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of
Us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps
Being led by pride

With peace of mind so hard to find
We're dwelling on the drastic signs
Another way to numb our mind
And as you close your eyes tonight
And pray for a better life
You'll see it flying helplessly away

We've all been lost
For most of this life

Everywhere we turn
More hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of

Artist  Avenged Sevenfold
Album  Avenged Sevenfold
Caught up in this madness, too blind to see
Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it's too late, you've wasted all your time, yeah

Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side, there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it's too late, you've wasted all your time

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong, but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it's too late, you've wasted all your time

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built, don't point the blame on me

Scream, scream, scream
The way you would if I ravaged your body
Scream, scream, scream
The way you would if I ravaged your mind

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

(In this madness, this madness, this madness, this madness)
(I lost control, in this madness, in this madness)
(I'll hunt again one night, in this madness, this madness)
(I'll hunt again one night)

Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all

Chances are that ya might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real

Still I'm on my way
(On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

I walk the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Follow dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall

Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
Ya know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real

Memories seem to fade
(On and on it goes)
Wash my view away

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever

And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

Take you down now, burn it all out
Throw you all around, get your fucking hands off me
What's it feel like? Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart now you're knocking at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll, a price for you alone
The only deal you'll find, I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick, sober up quick
Psycho lunatic crushing you with hands of fate
Shamed to find out, when it's too late
But you're all the same, trapped inside; Inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide, I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin, release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive

This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Die buried alive (let me take in your soul)

This is now your life
Die buried alive

My '16 locked and loaded
All fear has been aborted
You say the words and my weapon is drawn
This one could be my last time
Some people call it war crime
I may be staring down a lethal sight (to die)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line

I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know
With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me but never take us all (I'll crawl)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line

I know what you're thinking, I've been there before
So think of the times, the time we spent laughing away
So think of the times at home (life without a care)

Now I find myself in my own blood
(Never thought I'd lie in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair
I never put my faith in up above
(Never had much faith in up above)
But now, I'm hoping someone's there

I never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who cared
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no one said it's fair

Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I've sung my last song today
Remind the Lord to leave his light on for me
I'm free

Now I think I understand
How this world can overcome a man
Like a friend we saw it through
In the end I gave my life for you

Gave you all I had to give
Found a place for me to rest my head
While I may be hard to find
Heard there's peace just on the other side

Not that I could or that I would
Let it burn under my skin
Let it burn

Left this life to set me free
Took a piece of you inside of me
All this hurt can finally fade
Promise me you'll never feel afraid

Not that I could or that I would
Let it burn under my skin
Let it burn

I hope it's worth it here on the highway, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you
So tell everybody, the ones who walk beside me, yeah
I hope you'll find your own way when I'm not with you tonight

I hope it's worth it what's left behind me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you
So tell everybody, the ones who walk beside me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you tonight

You wanna hear my side?
You need to drown to know
With all the times it hurt me to fuck you
I built a wall with your blood to show

God save us
God save us all
God hates us
God hates us all

Total nightmare
Total nightmare

Nothing to heal, no one to break
Pills had a role now there's nothing to take
Nothing to trust, no one to fake
You'll find out sooner that it's best if we just know our place

My infiltrated mind, my lacerated soul
It took me years, create me, control you
I left myself for an idea I stole

God save us
God save us all
God hates us
God hates us all

Total nightmare

Liar, rape, kill
Love, hate, fear

You better take your time
(Liar, rape, kill)
You better take it slow
'Cause when you see the one

There's nothing left to show

One snap for the dying
One click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way

You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes anytime
Watch the clock till you unwind
You wanna cry about it
It's making me consider that I lost my mind
The way I see you must be blind

So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you cover me with manic fame

You wanna know about it?
But I'ma be fucking with you every time
Story broke and you're behind
And when you ask about it
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find

So this is the hate I've been born to
Full of the tales of the untrue

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

And I'm waiting, waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
And all the promises I'll find
No hesitating, you pull the trigger now your story's left behind
I know you wanna see me fry
Like my soul you won't survive

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

To die unknown
Would crush the fish lens we all see through
To kill the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true

(Now your nightmare comes to life)

Dragged you down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
(Peace of mind is less than never)

Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
(Burn the world, your last endeavor)

Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning
Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
(While your nightmare comes to life)

Can't wake up in sweat, cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons
(Victim of your own creation)

Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
(Loathing self-assassination)

You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain and while you slowly go insane they tell ya
("Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications")

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare

Fight (fight)
Not to fail (fail)
Not to fall (fall)
Or you'll end up like the others

Die (die)
Die again (die)
Drenched in sin (sin)
With no respect for another

Down (down)
Feel the fire (fire)
Feel the hate (hate)
Your pain is what we desire

Lost (lost)
Hit the wall (wall)
Watch you crawl (crawl)
Such a replaceable liar

And I know you hear their voices (calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (these signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul and it's ours now to steal
(As your nightmare comes to life)

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare

They all know
They all know

Sorry, did I wake your dreams? Some questions run too deep
We only, only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we find
Lost our way tonight (lost our way tonight)

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me) I'm losing my only dream
(Save me) I can use some guiding light, some place to go
You hear me, let me know

They all know
They all know

Ever since the day you left my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me) I'm losing my only dream
(Save me) I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
If you hear me, let me know

Help me find my way
Said help me find my way

No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and to a degree
Losing who I want to be
You'll find out right now

He may be out of his mind
But someday you will find
That sanity's left us all blind
And dragged us all behind

A moment seen through those eyes
Crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die
I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind
Then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind
And walked right through the door

I can see the pictures clear as yesterday
Pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay
But know you're not alone

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me) I'm losing my only dream
(Save me) I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
If you hear me, let me know

Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die

Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A life that healed a broken heart
With all that it could
Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart
With all that I could

Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place in time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold
A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find
A place in my mind

Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place in time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me
'Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place in time always on my mind
And the light you left remains but it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you're so far away

I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you when he lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied

So far away (So far...)
And I need you to know
So far away (So far...)
And I need you to, need you to know

Lost the meaning of our stay
Learn to live another day
Doubt the choices that we've made
I know that we can't hide our shame
It's only in disguise

Drowning in our own debris
Fool our thoughts as though we're free
Close our eyes so we can see
The depth of all we need to be
If only in my eyes

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
In a way

So try and numb me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
But I seem to find no better ways to consciously pretend

Silence all I want to say
With tendencies to run away
I'll run away with you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made, you know
Tonight the world dies

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
But I seem to find no better ways to consciously pretend

House full of roses, a letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages for anyone who cares
Collage of broken words and stories full of tears
Remembering your life, 'cause we wish that you were here

Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay, it's the end of all you've known
Time keeps passing by, but it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind, but some too deep to feel

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Some days you'll find me in a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself about the things I'll never know
What's left to find? 'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time, can we even up the score?

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime, yeah, woah

Nothing lasts forever, for all good things, it's true
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you
It must have been the season that threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation with promises unkind
And all the speculation, save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason, a reason just to stay
Well some just can't be bothered to stick around another day

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
Ooh, we've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

Hey kid, do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family

Hey, there's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you found yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now? Can you look at yourself?
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

(Hey kid) I have to question
What's with the violent aggression?
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family

Hey, why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty rerun
Welcome to the family

I'll try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now? So have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Coming for you and all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic, Rapid dementia
I won't be fine

I see you're a king who's been dethroned
Cast out in a world you've never known
Stand down, place your weapons by your side
It's our war, in the end we'll surely lose, but that's alright
So have you figured it out now? So have you figured it out?

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Deep inside, where nothing's fine, I lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside, I lost my...
Deep inside, where nothing's fine, I lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside, I lost my...

Lethargie macht sich breit, man das würd ich auch gern
wenn die Vorräte nur nicht schon alle aufgebraucht wär'n
Aber bitte keine Raststätte weil ich mich da schon eher,
wie Christian Anders nackt an' Knast kette
Lieber weiter anhalten, da will ich bloß nicht anhalten
Man, diese ganzen Gestalten, wo sich mir Fußnägel spalten
Haut fett und weiß, Abgase und Schweiß
WC-Fisch und 'n gieriger Toiletten-Greis
Fehrnfahrer-Merchandise, garantiert kein Liptonice
ein ziemlich hoher Preis, für einen kleinen Scheiß
Nee, nee, wir segeln weiter, aber Kapitäne sind wir ansich' nicht
wir ham' viel zu viel von unserem Land in Sicht
Schau' ich aus'm Fenster
seh' ich BMW-BWLer, Polo-Prolos, Bonzen-Benzler
TV Teutonia, von früh bis spät
ja, sie ist hart die Realität
aber, wir wissen, woher wir kommen und wohin wir müssen
und pissen, auf Alle, die die's besser wisen!

Jippieh, zurück in Hamburg-City
nur noch ein paar Minuten, und dann von Bord wie Pipi
Zu Hause, Pause von der großen Sause
aber momentan, immer noch Autofahr'n
Wieder da im Nassen und Blassen
das Mißtrauen ham' wir auf der Autobahn weiterfahren lassen
Wir treiben auf den Strassen, die immer in uns bleiben
Kool Keats und BIA-Bilder, die wie Schilder zeigen
Wir sind zurück in unserem Barrio
und des is' net bloß A Dorf, wie Mario
Wo die Bäume höher sind als die Häuser, die labern dumm 'rum
im Rathaus drin geht nix, aber drum 'rum
Großstadtkinder wissen was ich mein'
es muß was los sein, oder wir gehen ein
Wir brauchen eben, die Menschen und Action zum Leben
Hamburg kann uns das geben, was gehd'n, auf jeden
können alle anderen mal scheißen gehen
und sollten lieber mal ihr Leben lang auf Reisen gehen
denn wir ham' auch noch die derben MCs die's krachen lassen
täglich Vinyl-Container, die in Massen die Stadt verlassen
Ja, hier wurde die Saat gesäht, für das wozu ihr gerade den Arsch bewegt!

Album  Bambule
Wickeda-MC, mit Flows pur Natur wie Sensi
und Freestyles näher am Geschehen als jedes Hip-Hop-Fanzine.
Fuchs' mich in die Materie, da es Möglichkeiten unbegrenzt gibt.
Leider folgen viele falschen Vorbildern und lernen's nie,
das Publikum zu rocken, da es auf 'ner anderen Frequenz liegt,
was uns nicht betrifft, weil man unsere Bühnenpräsenz liebt
und Rap-Exzellenz sieht, die sich der Vorstellungskraft Vieler entzieht.
Sam Semilia und die Beginner, ihr kennt sie! - Woh!

Au! Der Magen knurrt wie Sau!
Ich hau' ab aus meinem Bau.
Verschließ' die Tür, ziehe durchs Revier,
markier' hier und da mal, dass ich da war.
Höre Gelaber, schleiche gerade über die Promenade,
bin Zeuge einer großen Maskerade.
Große Buchstaben, grelle Farben, die mir sagen, dass sie Kabelfernsehen haben.
Gestiken von Gerngesehenden, aber jeder Fuchs weiß,
dass ähnliche Garderobe heute leider nicht mehr Schutz heißt.
Deshalb schnupper' ich, was befindet sich da darunter.
Immer auf der Hut - wie Udo - und darunter!

Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!
Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!
Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!
Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!

Wir haben Pfoten wie Gabi, Mikros als Boten für Rap Schoten,
verboten Quoten-MCs auf unserem Boden zu toben.
Durchkreuzen Wälder, wir werden älter, Alter wird's kälter.
Egal, nicht für'n warmen Platz bin ich beim Major,
press' Vitamine aus Rap wie aus Orangen Granini,
verteil' Beginner-Sticker wie Panini, ernten Platini.
Ohne I und ohne Style-tauschen,
wenn ich Mega-Byte gestalt' ich Hits zum 'reinlauschen.
Wenn Beats im Reim rauschen: Macht nix,
was dreckig ist, kehr'n wir nicht unter'n Teppich,
der Grund warum ich ständig Loops aufgepeppt krieg'.
Viele vergeigen bloß.
Mir egal, wenn bei mir alle Stricke reißen, bin ich den Galgen los.
Wir stylen groß!
Du siehst mit List gefuchste Clips, guckst'e Gigs
von den Beginnern im TV, geklaut ist bei uns nix.
Und kriegt wer Futterneid, tut uns leid, kommt vor, bei soviel Geilheit.
Zahme Vögel singen wie Münchener von Freiheit.
Kein Sinneswandel, keine Floskel, ungeschminkt, ich bleib' da
und werd' bestimmt nicht Amsel, Drossel oder Fink – ich bleib' Star!

Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!
Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!
Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!

Eine Pfote am Mikro, eine auf den Tasten,
ein Auge auf's Geschäft, eines im Plattenkasten,
ein Ohr für's Rudel und eins für den Gegner,
ein Tanzbein und ein Arschtreter.
Ein Fuchs muss tun, was ein Fuchs tun muss:
Luxus und Ruhm und rulen bis zu Schluss.
Das ist mein Ziel, was ich noch nie so klar sah'.
"Sky is the limit." – Pah! Und was ist mit der NASA?!

So sicher, wie Wölfe bei Vollmond jaulen,
Elstern alles was glänzt klauen,
sitzen wir als Füchse in unserem Bau drin,
feilen mit roten Augen an Tracks und Texten, bis sie was taugen.
Drin' alles ruhig, doch draußen wollen uns tausende unsere Ideen rauben
Eigentlich ist es Wahnsinn, Lieder wie diese 'rauszubringen,
weil damit garantiert ist, dass die der Anderen bald auch so klingen.
Hamburg-City rules, wer behauptet was anderes?
Jetzt offiziell: Ich battle jeden MC, egal, wie bekannt er ist.
Mein Treibstoff ist Canabis-Sativa, denn ich rap' high lieber,
Tag für Tag wieder, letztes Jahr schon Chart-Leader.
Mit Denyo in der Style-Liga, jetzt mal wieder ein fettes Feature,
Mad mixt wie'n Barkeeper, Eißfeldt macht den Beat klar
und schon schallt es durch eure Speaker, wir gehen weiter und tiefer.
Hamburg-City ist am Start, also wie habt ihr's lieber?
Ausgefuchst oder ausgelutscht? Für letzteres: geht zur Konkurrenz!
Wir bleiben in Eimsbush und feiern fette Mongo-Jams! (Yeah! Yeah!)

Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Jagen tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!
Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel tollt, wenn der Rubel rollt!

Jede Nacht, jeden Tag auf der Jagd, denn das Rudel rollt, wenn der Rubel tollt!

Bring!
- Eißfeldt?!
"Ja, hallo! Ich wollt mal sagen: Füchse sind gar keine Rudeltiere."
- Achso... Ja, ähm... Ja, egal, 's Rhyme ist fett, der Rhyme ist fett.
"Gut, tschüß!"

Oh God, I can't believe
All the places that I've been and all of those I've come to meet
Blessings of faith, when I have only a mustard seed
For every hardship in my life
I'll hold Your name and I'll do just fine
All praise are Yours and none are mine
Instruments played by hands that cannot read or recollect one solitary note or line
Yet play in perfect harmony
God whispers into some men's ears,
Well He screams into mine
Speaking, endlessly, all my hopes and fears
Nay, simply I'll reply

Blessings so sweet and divine
None of which I do deserve
For only a humble servant am I
Lowly, I'll wash Your feet
With the tears I've cried

Each joy in my life and each breath in my lungs
Attests to Your overwhelming grace
Show us Your love
You see my tattered shoes, my broken spirit
Unequipped to finish the race I could have never won
So You snatched me up into Your strong arms
And over Your shoulders, I was slung
Lord, You've given me the tools to live as Your own
Talent, drive, and the willingness to run
All praise are Yours and none are mine

Blessings so sweet and divine
None of which I do deserve
For only a humble servant, am I
Hope my humility can outlast my pride

There is such hope in the stories we've been told
Recounted endless times by the aging and old
Tales of peace, worship and holy places
Palaces adorned with gold and lofty terraces
But I'm always left with quiet dismay
Cause I'm told that some of those I love won't be with me
So I'm left behind in an eternal place
Cause the ones who meant the most didn't receive Your grace
They called it beautiful, but to me it holds nothing that is holy
I can only know what I've seen
And what I've seen is that You've made us clean
Given us the right to be anything we want to be
Why would You give me eyes to see and then deny me these?
Eternity is a lock found inside our hearts and You've handed Humanity the key
So I won't be swayed by fantasies of unquenchable flames
Or some place of torment, the damned never to see Your face
We are all Your creation
You love us all the same
A Father doesn't sit idly by while His children are maimed
I've seen true Grace
I promise you we will never feel the lick of those flames
Where Death is your glory?
Where Death is your sting?
For we are all children of the King
Every last one an eternal being
So I'll reject your fear and hatred
For I bring Good News that will be for all nations!
I've seen wholeness in the broken
I've seen health in the sick
Why do we stifle the Word You've spoken?
If it kills me, I'll tear these walls down brick by brick
I've seen hospitality in the homeless
I've seen Light in the darkness
And I've seen hope in the damned
So if all that has meant the most to me isn't present after my last breath
Count me with the fallen sheep and send me to the depths

Name  If They're Not Counted, Count Me Out
Artist  Being As An Ocean
Album  Dear G-D...
I do dimly perceive that while everything around me is ever-changing, ever-dying there is, underlying all that change, a living power that is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves, and recreates.
That informing power or spirit is God, and since nothing else that I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is.
And is this power benevolent or malevolent?
I see it as purely benevolent.
For I can see, that in the midst of death, Life persists, in the midst of untruth, Truth persists, in the midst of darkness, Light persists.
Hence I gather, that God is Life, Truth, Light, He is Love.
He is the supreme good.
But He is no god who merely satisfies the intellect, if He ever does.
God to be God must rule the heart and transform it.
He must express Himself in every smallest act of His votary.
It is proved not by extraneous evidence, but in the transformed conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God within.
To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.
This realization is preceded by an immovable faith.
He who would, in his own person, test the fact of God's presence can do so by a living faith, and since faith itself cannot be proved by extraneous evidence, the safest course is to believe in...; the law of Truth and Love.
Exercise of faith will be the safest where there is a clear determination summarily to reject all that is contrary to Truth and Love.
I confess that I have no argument to convince through reason, faith transcends reason.
All that I can advise is not to attempt the impossible.

These words might mean nothing
But it's a chance I'm willing to take
Cause maybe I'm wrong and lives can change
I'm singing out of my insecurity
So someone, somewhere might be impacted by what I've made
I fidget and sway back and forth
Biting my nails down until they bleed
There is a lie that I've believed
I'd tell you, but I'm so scared of what you'd think
So I apologize if I've caused you to wake
Just close your eyes and let the beat rock you back to sleep
I'll tell you in the morning
About how this man you see
Often times feels like a child
Self-conscious and weak
I'll still put pen to paper
Try to explain these things
That invade my thoughts in my waking hours
Stories of Kings and princes that have lost their way
God, we'd give anything just to feel safe
Deep down, we all know our worth
We just need someone to truly love us first
So we tip toe around these crowded rooms
Hoping someone in attendance might be able to dress our wounds
We cry without uttering a single word
So gather close, circle round
Cause maybe you've just never heard
And I'll tell you the story of the Love I've found
About the Truth embedded in you long before your birth
I'll ask once more
What are these words worth?

Raise your glass high
And share with me in my joys and grievings
I toast to the mountains and valleys
To the future and the days gone by
I invite you in with good humor and levity
All I have is yours and I pray that you drink deeply
My cup has been emptied
So I may see what it tastes like to be free
Cause for so long this glass has owned me
Focused on the chalice rather than what it contained
So I gave all of worth to the needy and the rest to the sea
Then I looked around at all of the beautiful things that I had gained
What can a glass speak of its contents
And can it boast at its filling?
What else could it do but mutter a quiet thanks
So it is that I look forward to my spillings
For I am sure that such times are the only thing steadying my hands from their violent shaking
So with gladness in my heart and hope in my eyes
I drink to my fill of Your celebration wine
And as I pour glass after glass
I'll lift it high
(I'll lift You high)
And give a hearty toast to life

There sit two lovers
One's eyes intently chasing the other's
She doesn't love him anymore
But he'll stick it out till the end
This he had sworn
Lying awake in bed
Feeling the spot on my chest
Where you used to rest your head
You see love's a funny thing the way it lingers in the mind
No matter what you do or the passing of time
That ember still glows for those lovers behind
No matter if it's well remembered
That light still shines
Good times take precedent over every incident
No matter how poorly spent
So we put on these ridiculous fronts
Like we were just fooling around
Our love was only childish fun
Yet we know different
That it meant something to us
And that piece still lingers in each one that we've loved
So we pick up the pieces
Try and make a half a whole
But in the back of our minds
There's quite a different story to be told
That Love has kissed our lips
That Love has touched our eyes
And no matter how sincere
Love has changed our lives
And even if all love has flown
We'll have a few scars to proudly show
Cause at the end of our lives
We can say, 'At least we tried'
Lying awake in bed
Feeling the spot on my chest
Where you used to rest your head

Name  The Hardest Part Is Forgetting Those You Swore You Would Never Forget
Artist  Being As An Ocean
Album  Dear G-D...
You are the topic of every epic we have ever been told
And as I stand on this cliff, the wind whips through me and I am made bold
Once again, Your presence creeps into my consciousness
Grace made tangible in this newly anointed place
And I am brought to my clear senses
That none of my perceived failings or disgrace
Has ever touched my being or inheritance
I am whole, I am clean, I am free
And I brought to my knees
Sink in; permeate this weary flesh
Breathe; life as clean and fresh
As the salt-seasoned breeze
Please Father, pull me to my feet

'Why are you kneeling, my son?
I put strength in that back-bone
Knowing that you would fall
But I promise, you will never taste defeat
You are whole, you are clean, you are free
Get up, rise from your knees!'

We can no longer linger in the shadows of our shame and brokenness
For as sure as the wind blows
He has already redeemed all of this
Live as whole, live as clean, live as free
Everything you were made to be
Standing at the edge of self-discovery
Tired and weary
Our body trembles, buckles
We are afraid of being hurt again
Been stabbed in the back by our own friends
We don't know if we can mend
Minds riddled with unsuccessful recoveries
We're scared
Lord, we're terrified
But dive in we must
Cause there has to be something better than this
For we see testimony of You in the sea
Your creation, all of nature
So with a sudden rush
We abandon our solitary perching place
And as we wash away the mourning dust
Immersed; we see Your face

I swear this isn't the end
But I still feel so alone
Even when I'm surrounded by my best friends
Word's can't penetrate
A tree in the wind
I bend
Falling faster into the depths
I'm falling, I'm falling
Under such depression, I can barely even catch my breath
Words can't mend and love does not sink in
Why can't I see Your face?

Clawing at my chest
Looking for some sort of reprieve
I swear this isn't the end
But when will I feel comfortable in my own skin?

Knowing fundamental truth
Doesn't seem to matter
After such tremendous abuse
Cause I've worked this ground since my youth
And still, the land has yet to bare any sort of fruit
I'll continue to toil and plow
Hoping one day I'll make You proud
'What have a got to show?'
As I wipe the sweat from my brow

So tired, so tired of showing Love so deep
That most aren't even willing to feel
See what I've seen
Open your eyes and recognize that this is real
This season brings darkness so profound
I've become lost and can't seem to be found
Contorted, racked with pain
I know should feel free, yet I continue to sing this sad refrain
I can't sleep and food has lost its taste
God, I'm so sick of this place

Then I'm touched
By the hands of a brother
And like a rush
Passing through my exterior
I hear my name
A hush
A son, loved by a Father
I've been made alive again

This room's alive
Breathing
In this moment, each one of us is leaving
All of life's worries and troubles far behind
Speaking in tongues
Sweating blood
Rapture
Some people search their entire lives for such a cure
Screaming silently inside
Past horrors plaguing their minds
This is our release
This is our violent plea
Hearts scarred and bandaged
Souls weathered and damaged
This is our release
Our violent plea
It's time to burn the past
Take off our self-fabricated coping masks
We'll let each other see who we really are
With our broken limbs and battle scars
Naked, all things stripped away
You'll see we've all gone through similar pains
And like children, we count and play our hiding games
But we won't come inside when Grace calls our name
Slaves to our guilt and shame
Pointing the finger at the one who was never really to blame
Ourselves
Reopen your wounds anew
And watch the broken come to stand by you
You don't have to feel alone
Cause I know this place could feel like home
There is no need to run and hide
When your true family is standing by your side

Let the Kingdom fall on this place
Those who have never felt Your love
Feel Your warm embrace
We will proclaim Your continuing creation
Made evident by our many reconciliations
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
Loving with every ounce of our being
We are made whole as we draw near
We will see Your purpose brought about on this earth
Men, made giants out of pain and dirt
Those of us brought up in broken homes
Don't have to fear, we will be made whole
This world we used to view as broken
Is truly a masterpiece in progress
Set in motion by the Words that were spoken
We can choose to stay on the wayside
And watch others grow, while our spirits die
Or we can pick up our tools and chisel away at this life
Revealing a perfect plan
This world is not past redeeming
Creating perfection will take quiet patience
And a love that's endearing
We will not stray
We will not tarry
And in the end, we'll see all unbelief dead and buried
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
Loving with every ounce of our being
We are made whole as we draw near
No one will leave this room sick
Cause You are especially fond of All
And we have faith that You can do this
We have faith

Album  Dear G-D...
We pack up our gear
And we're gone again
Driven by passion, outward
Away from family and friends
But what they can't see
Is that every day I'm drowning in a sea
Of faces that I miss so desperately
With each flashing countenance
A torrent of emotion, joy, and memories
The people I've grown to love so deeply
Throughout the years
I've chosen a big family
And the weight of their absence
Has brought me more than once to tears
I wake from sleep violently
Only to witness those lives and faces
Disappear slowly behind me
(I'm drowning)
Again I'm pulled back into deep waters
Washed further away from my sisters and brothers
Am I truly living a dream
When the only time I spend with you is in my sleep?

How am I to stay the course, to remain bold
When all those my heart longs for
Remain firmly anchored at home
Am I truly living a dream
When the only time I spend with you is in my sleep?

With every "it's-been-awhile" embrace
I wish it could last an eternity
Silently praying for the courage to say
"Oh G-d, how I've missed you!
I've seen you in my sleep!
We were laughing, crying, joking
You know, the way it used to be
Back when we younger and all that much more free
I just hope you see that nothing's changed between you and me
No matter the time we've spent apart
I know it's not always easy to show it
But please believe that I carried you in my heart
That you were with me through every mile
I could have sworn I saw your phantom standing in the aisle!"

It seems you already know what I'm thinking
And that, even after all this time
Some things still do go without saying

We savored the taste of our sweet youth
And now, with calloused hands, gather the remaining fruit
To go any farther, we must endure further pains
Skinned, mashed, and finally strained
Fermenting in the time spent away
Only to return with a fine vintage
To cheers to the health of those who stayed

Here I stand
High strung and alone
In the court of your Lord's most forgotten son
Tell me witness, what's the difference between addiction to truth and conviction?

The difference must lie in the actions
Spread across a person's life
Did it prove to be obsession?
Compelled to condemn what they don't agree with
Endlessly driven toward the "right"
A creeping sickness afflicting the others' lives

With proclamations of derision and disgrace
Instead of offering an alternate way
You shot us in the foot before we'd even begun to race!
Conviction stands as a guiding rudder
Through this world's turbulence, storms, and thunder
The helm turns according the movements of our hearts
(This vessel dives and darts)

See conviction wells up inside, an imprint from above
Seeks to reject injustice and not to judge
Works to fix the things that are broken
Walks in humble regard to their fellow man
And never forgets that the greatest law is Love

The difference must lie in the actions
(Was it out of Love or hate?)
Did it prove to be obsession?
(Looking at the walls you've made)

When I fell down there was no regret
Just that lack of laughter, plus my newfound debt
Be it freedom or a shortened spine,
Us broken heathens have learned to lie to ourselves

Well I can't get too close without wanting all of you
So I'll settle right into this back seat
But to be honest, I'm not sure if I can take the solitude
It's been a long time running
Since I sighted my first love
And this mountainside's only getting steeper
My breath's burning in my lungs
I wonder when I'm gonna catch a break
or at least be able to breathe easier
This drive is telling me to be all that I can't for her
You're not holding up your end of the bargain,
but I'll continue to hold up mine
'Cause I've always been a betting man
And I'm dying for you to prove me right
I see the potential you have inside
Maybe that's why I've continued to fight
You just can't see all that you are to me
So I'll just have to learn to be alright
Without you by my side
My bed seems so much colder at night
This chill doesn't seem to be going away
So I'll acquire a taste for its bite

Give these dry lips words to speak
A wandering soul, hopeful for living springs
Searching tirelessly for a well, blue and deep
From which to pull up strength, something cool to drink
There are deserts hidden deep inside you and me
Come now, sit for a while and breathe
You don't have to say a thing
Darling, your silence says everything

You're not holding up your end of the bargain,
but I'll continue to hold up mine
'Cause I've always been a betting man
And I'm just dying for you to prove me right

I just want to know your story
Learning, so I may love you complete
'Cause if we dig deep enough
There are wells hidden deep inside of you and me

You're not holding up your end of the bargain,
but I'll continue to hold up mine
'Cause I've always been a betting man
And I'm just dying for you to prove me right

How did I let this happen?
Let myself slip back into the role of victim
Thought I'd left that all "way-back-when"
While forgetting Grace, I increased my own tragedy

Fallen back into the "how-could-this-have-happened-to-me's"
Like some melancholy play
That no one paid to see
I'm directing on anyway

It seems we have this sickness
A misconception, if you will
That once we've triumphed over something
It lays in the dust, eternal, never to breathe again
But that's not the way this works
Reflections of what haunt us
Will take on new forms in the end
The likes of which we'd not yet seen
How quickly our hearts fill with dread
Yeah, it rains on the righteous as well as the wicked
But some afflictions can feel like death

I've fallen back into the "how-could-this-have-happened-to-me's"
Like some melancholy play
That no one paid to see
I'm directing on anyway

We either fight or flee
Which one's it gonna be
Realize it's an old demon in a new disguise
I hope you stand up tall to face him
Pray you have the strength to look him in his eyes
Scream loud in proclamation
"I've seen your kind before
G-d, I let the signs fly right on by
Waited till my spirit was laid low
But now my eyes are open wide
This time I see right through your lies
You've tried to put me in the ground before
Extinguish my light
I've got the scars to show for it
But what was once a reminder of death, is now an affirmation of life
Because I took the worst you threw at me and, damn it, I survived.
So get behind me, devil
I refuse to let myself be bound
I won't adhere to mental slavery
Even while your torments abound
Depart from me!"

I swear there's a strength inside you
A faint whisper calling you to be brave
And the next time it seems the darkest
Like you couldn't possibly be saved
Stripped of all comfort and weak
I hope you face your adversary
And find you're stronger than you think

A nine-year drought
Brought torrents in May
You had chosen what to call me
But were given a new name
Always the strong one
You carried on in faith

Broken mother, broken father
It was your example that made Grace fully tangible
Looking at your mistakes showed me what risks to take

Working hard to make ends meet
No matter what, please know you did well by me
Forever humble and first to forgive
Treating the other as family
Never forgetting where you've been
You showed us what it means to wholly live

Adorned with quiet strength
You proved that meek doesn't have to mean weak
Learned to show Love to all, no matter title or rank
While not your own, you've helped raise me
And for the things you've shown me
I could hardly offer sufficient thanks
Even as the sickness lingers in your blood
You've carried on in hope and Love
And even though trouble surrounds all the while
You've continued to greet all with a heavenly smile

We watched your body fade
But until the end, your spirit shown bright
Something that cancer could never take away
We laid hands on and prayed
Oh G-d, how steadfast you stayed
How I wish I had possessed such faith
Now we feel the weight of your absence
And it's raised some doubt and questions
But in memorial we'll press on
Because, in the end, it's all you ever wanted for your sons
That we might realize our dreams
Live life beautifully

Letting the rest of our lives stand as proof
There is a point to all of this
To learn to love as you

I have to break this cycle
For another heart, I refuse to be held liable
Seeing their eyes fill with tears
A burning in my chest, lumps form in my throat
I feel every bit of the hurt I've caused, as I realize my worst fears
I've wounded another human being
These hands were made to heal
But they've only added to the misery
G-d, our natures can be such a curse
How our lives conjoin without consent
Yet a blessing they still remain, full of purpose
To become one flesh was the intent
And from one flesh we were made
Beautiful communion, we have made

Album  How We Both Wondrously Perish
We are all homeless in one way or another
Whether we've lost ourselves to lust
Inflamed passions for things desired; forgotten the other
Wandering aimlessly, in love with something
that will only collect dust
Or perhaps we've been led into the wilderness
by some radiant lover, just to be left out in the cold
A distant memory, and the warmth of home
What are we then to do?
'Cause in the heat of bliss, we swore we would never love another
There was truth and dignity in that oath
Can there be any hope for their retention, in its breaking?
That even while being disavowed, we recognize humanity
We have all made mistakes,
And G-d, I've made mistakes
But my mistakes haven't made me

Oh fallen acorn, lost and alone
Can you still be kissed by fire, give up your seed
And spring up into a towering, mighty oak?

We've been led into the wilderness
by some radiant lover, just to be left in the cold
A distant memory, the warmth of home
'Cause in the heat of bliss, we swore we would never love another
We've all made mistakes, every last one of us
And just because we've told a lie, can we not still grow to be honest?

Oh fallen acorn, lost and alone
Can you still be kissed by fire, give up your seed
And spring up into a towering, mighty oak?

Thrown off kilter
None of us would have thought
We'd be who we are now
When we were still little
Eyes wide to possibility
Who could have known
That we'd witness such depravity

Album  How We Both Wondrously Perish
We've all done things that we're ashamed of
We think they make us unworthy of love
We carry regret in our demeanors
Wear it all over our faces
In our smallest actions; our greatest fears
Daring all who would come near to break the tension
To incidentally mention the demons you've been battling
Regret and shame leaking through every expression
Unable to forgive ourselves for things we could have stopped from happening

And it seems we've been thrown into an endless cycle
Of pain and suffering
But if we learn to let go
We don't have to play out this tragedy
Forgive the things you hate in yourself
So that you might be grace to someone else

We've turned to others, searching for some kind of safety
Only to get caught in someone else's insecurities
Realizing our own humanity we accept shortcomings
Simply natural side effects; fallible being
Forgive the things that you hate in yourself
So that you might be grace to someone else
And in the end, find that it's you who has been freed

Forgive the things you hate in yourself
So that you might be grace to someone else

They told me yesterday
I'd know all what you're about
Stretch my wingspan out to reach you here
I'll always make my move on you

You're right
I've got a long way up from here
My little dreamer always
Has got to know what you know

So fine
The slammer in my heart is pure
Sometimes I feel I've got the wrong time
And you're just sitting on my lifeline, oh-whoa

False reality's in drive
You've got to let it go
Blood, sweat, tears are set aside
'Cause it's cooler on the water
Yes, it's dryer on the water
Yes, it's sweeter on the water
Yes, it's better on the water
On the water

I told them yesterday
We men are traveling backwards slowly
By next year there'll be a death parade
Why am I feeling so utterly shamed?

You're right
I've got a long way up from here
My little dreamer always
Has got to know what you know

So fine
The slammer in my heart is pure
Sometimes I feel I've got the wrong time
And you're just sitting on my lifeline, oh-whoa

It's sweeter on the water
Yes, it's better on the water
On the water

It's sweeter on the water
Yes, it's better on the water
On the water

It's sweeter on the water
Yes, it's better on the water
On the water

I shouldn't laugh but I know I'm a failure in your eyes
I know it's daft but I guess that I know it deep inside
It feels like we're ready to crack these days, you and I
When it's just the two of us, Only the two of us I could die

You left my heart like an abandoned car
Old and worn out no use at all
But I used to be free

We're gonna separate ourselves tonight
We're always running scared but holding knives
But there's a black chandelier
It's casting shadows and lies

I'll sit in silence for the rest of my life if you'd like
Dressing our wounds with industrial gloves made of wire
Feel it penetrating the skin we begin to relax
When it's just the two of us
And a cute little cup of cyanide

You left my heart like an abandoned car
Old and worn out no use at all
But I used to be free

We're gonna separate ourselves tonight
We're always running scared but holding knives
But there's a black chandelier
It's casting shadows and lies

We're gonna separate ourselves tonight
We're always running scared but holding knives
But there's a black chandelier

You left my heart like an abandoned car
Old and worn out no use at all
But I used to be free

We're gonna separate ourselves tonight
We're always running scared but holding knives
But there's a black chandelier
It's casting shadows and lies

We're gonna separate ourselves tonight
We're always running scared but holding knives
But there's a black chandelier

How do we get out from all they put out?
The feelings are let out, and we give our best out
When envy comes put on, all you do is look on
You can't put your shoes on; convenience is pulling you down...

How do we get out of this filthy bed I've made?
It's long and it's overdue, no matter what I've said

And suddenly it comes to me through all the pain and the misery:
All I ever wanted was you here with me

I'm not the only victim of stubborn, foolish pride
I'm not the only one who has something bad to hide

And suddenly it comes to me through all the lies and the misery:
All I ever wanted was you here with me

And suddenly I realize:
All I ever, ever needed was you here with me, you here with me

I'm not the only victim of stubborn, foolish pride
I'm not the only one who has something bad to hide

How do we get out?
How do we get out?
How do we get out?
How do we get out?

You say I'm not good enough for you
Although you say you're not good enough for anyone but you
You say you just have to be left alone
So now you're alone

So you curse me, and you hit me,
And you claw me until I bleed
Then you want me, and you want me,
And your want turns into your need

Submission is free, it's just what we need
When I talk you better listen to me
Submission is free, it's just what we need
When I talk you better listen to me

So I grip you by the back of your mane,
You say: "it's no good without a little bit of pain"
You say I do nothing but hurt
I'll show you hurt

So you curse me, and you hit me,
And you claw me until I bleed
Then you want me, oh, and you want me,
And your want turns into your need

Submission is free, it's just what we need
When I talk you better listen to me

(Do you want to be hypnotized?
All you have to do is move your body
In what ever way feels comfortable for you

Just let yourself sink into the groove
And move

Fix your eyes on a spot
It doesn't matter where
Just fix your eyes on one spot
And begin to relax

Feel your mind and body
Beginning to wind down
Wind down, wind down
And relax

If you have any thoughts
Just let them drift through your mind
Like beautiful clouds
Across a clear blue sky

Just through your mind and away from you
Through your mind and away
As you relax
Deeper, deeper and deeper relax

Just let go of stress and tension
Let go of worry and doubt and relax

Imagine a staircase standing in front of you
With ten, wide, safe, stairs
Down, down to perfect relaxation
Down to peace and contentment
Down towards the happiness that you deserve

And as I count down from ten
Take one step with each number
One step down

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Deeper, deeper, deeper relaxed
That's it, just let go and relax)

You've stolen my heart, it's true
You see the shape of things to come
Why give up our lives to the brutes and fools
Ah, tear it all apart

You see the shape of things to come

Why this now, girl?
Will we kill each other?

Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Adam in chains

They've broken your heart
Ah yeah, they're gonna tear your world apart
Why make up a lie
And believe it's true
Ah, tear it all apart

I know the shape of things to come

Why this now, girl?
Oh, will we murder each other?

Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Want revenge

In the mind of a madman
There are colour explosions
An eclipse of emotion

Why tear our world apart?
Why tear it all apart?
Why tear our world apart, girl?

Well, I wish, I was born a thousand years ago
And I wish that I sailed the darkened sea
On a great big clipper ship, goin' from this land into that
In a sailors suit and cap away from the big city, away from the big city

Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils in this town
And of himself and those around
And I'm closing in on death

And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

Ah, Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine
Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine

I don't know just where I'm goin', ah
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can, yeah
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you, things aren't quite the same
It's a mainline to my pain

( I can feel it )
Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine, heroin
( I can feel it )
Jesus died for somebody's sins
( I can feel it )
But not mine, heroin
I said, Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine, heroin

I have made a very big decision
I gonna try to nullify my life, you know
I get so low and then the smack flows
I don't care, I'm gonna make it my wife

Because when the blood begins to flow
And shoots up the droopers neck
And I'm closin' in on death, you can all go take a walk
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine, heroin
Jesus died for somebody's sins
( I can feel it )
But not mine, heroin

I said, Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine, heroin
I said, Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine, heroin
Not mine, heroin, smack attack

Jesus died for somebody's sins
But not mine, heroin
Jesus died for somebody's sins

I'd do anything
For my sweet sixteen,
And I'd do anything
For a little runaway child

Gave my heart an engagement ring,
She took everything,
Everything I gave her
Oh, sweet sixteen

Built a moon
For a rocking chair,
I never guessed it would
Rock her far from here
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Someone's building a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone's building a candy brain
And filled it in

I'd do anything
For my sweet sixteen,
Oh, I'd do anything
For a little runaway child

Well, memories may burn you,
Memories grow older as people can
They just get colder
Like sweet sixteen

Well, I see it's clear,
Baby, that you are
All through here
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Someone's building a candy house

Yea, gettin' over you
How, how do you think it feels, yeah?
To get up in the morning, get over you.

Wipe away the tears, get over you, get over, get over

Wherever I go, wherever I go,
I have to question the hand that I hold close.
Wherever I go, wherever I go,
I have to silence the words that you fear most.

Don't ever let go, don't ever let go,
Are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go,
We're at the end of a burning tightrope.

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind,
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide.
'Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again.

Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high,
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time.
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again.

Together I know, together I know,
That we'd burn like a rocket's afterglow.
Together I know, together I know,
We could conquer the stars beyond this world.

We let it all go, we let it all go,
I'm just a voice on a broken radio.
We let it all go, we let it all go,
We got lost in the constellations.

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind,

Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high,
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time.
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again.
Don't think twice again.

And after all of these years, and all of this time, darling, if
I'm still a question in your mind, just say the words and this will end.

You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights.
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights.
You told me we should never be afraid of heights again.
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights.
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights.
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again.

Wherever I go, wherever I go, I hear your voice on a broken radio.
Wherever I go, wherever I go, I know we'll burn like a rocket's afterglow.
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go, so are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go, are we just watching the final chapter close?

Brothers in arms who share my fears,
Time to protect what you hold dear.
There's been a rise in new ideas,
Threating to change the way we live.

Who knows what troubles found a way,
Found a way to your door today.
Who knows what troubles on its way,
On its way to intimidate.

All I want is a Big Red Gun!
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun!
And all I want is a Big Red Gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot 'till the thrill is gone!
'Cause this is my right no matter the cost.
Get outta my sight when baby's got a Big Red Gun!

Pride is a weapon in your hand.
Freedom awards the faithful man.
I hear the message loud and clear.
Straight from his lips into my ears.

And Lord I just can't walk away,
Walk away from the enemy.
The law will never disagree,
On the target of my insecurities.

All I want is a Big Red Gun!
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun!
And all I want is a Big Red Gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot 'till the thrill is gone!
And how many lives will have to be lost,
To understand why my baby's got a Big Red Gun?

We call them twisted and deranged
But we gave them the keys to annihilate
How long before the next one's in the ground?
Your proud of all your history,
History made a big mistake
The judege jury stand before you now

Oh Momma what have I become

Hey!

Another, tragedy has,
set the scene for,
conscious to be revealed.
At home the February,
February winds are howling...

Don't tell me we're adversaries.
Don't tell me we're sworn enemies.
'Cause we all need necessary,
Means to protect what we love.

An ocean lies between us,
Sufferings are constant, we never see.
Behind our sanctuary,
Sanctuary, walls it's so easy to breathe.
Where is our empathy?
Has, empathy been lost while drifting at sea.
We are the refugees,
Don't worry we'll survive on hope

Don't tell me we're adversaries,
Don't tell me we're sworn enemies,
'Cause we all need necessary,
Means to protect what we love.

Light up your book of matches,
Open your hearts to ACTION.
We all need second chances,
What reason to help but for love!

February Winds!

NO we are not adversaries,
We were not born enemies,
We all need necessary means to protect what we love.

Light up your broken matches,
Open your hearts to ACTION.
We all need second chances,
What reason to help but for love!

We are not adversaries,
We are not sworn enemies,
We all need necessary means to protect what we love!!!

February Winds!
The message that we send,
Will come back in the end.

Respect! Is never given enough today.
I'm tired of looking the other way.
Respect! An appetite that we can't sustain.
We're on a mission to kiss our days away.

So how long before the rivers start to rise dear?
Yeah I thank my lucky stars to be alive here.

Respect! A generation of castaways,
Under a nation of tidal waves.
Are we the passengers or the prey?
You can't escape from the past on holiday.

So how long before the rivers start to rise dear?
Pack your bags because the tides is getting high.

Don't be afraid of the view from the corner because,
That's just the Captain and Crew jumping off of the mast.
All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats!
All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats!
Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse.
This is the point where the bomb reaches critical mass.
All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats!
All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats!

Catastrophic events don't change.
Today we face but tomorrow we pay.
But don't you worry cause we'll be safe.
I've got a ticket to piss your days away.

So how long before the rivers start to rise dear?
Yeah I thank my lucky stars to be alive here.

Don't be afraid of the view from the corner because,
That's just the Captain and Crew jumping off of the mast.
All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats!

We're sailing from the coast.
Disappearing too fast.
We're sailing from the coast.
Sunken  into the past.

All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats!
All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats!

We're sailing from the coast.
Disappearing too fast.

We can never never come back.

Horses and chariots
Churches and states
Devotion turns dangerous
When armed with rules of faith.

Prisoners and patriots
Angels and saints
If minds are persuaded enough
Compassion turns to hate.

(So when the)
Tide comes to bury us
Together we must stay.
(Don't let their)
Horses and chariots
Drag our love away.
No!

Borders and boundary signs
Drawn by red tape
Those who colour outside of the lines
Define the human race.

Warlords and suffering eyes
Soldiers and slaves
The side of the fence that we climb
Determines who's afraid.

(So when the)
Tide comes to bury us
Together we must stay.
(Don't let their)
Horses and chariots
Drag our love away.
(Until we)
Swallow our pride
Our hearts will collide.

And the skies of hysteria will
Come rain down on you.
Cleanse the salt from the hands that divide
Our world in two.

(So when the)
Tide comes to bury us
How can we live when so many die?
(Don't let their)
Horses and chariots
Hide the view from their eyes
(Until we)
Swallow our pride
We've chosen a faith, we've chosen a side.
(Until we)
Swallow our pride
Our hearts will collide.

Tired of all the promises and never coming through.
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you.
And all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true.
And life's become a battle that you swore you'd never lose.

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right.
We're always searching for the reason why...
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb.
Don't wait up for that moment to arrive...
Leave Them All Behind.

Well I'm tired of all the promises and never coming through.
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you.
And all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true.
And when you lose your confidence your mind plays tricks on you.

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right.
We're always searching for the reason why...
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb.
We keep on getting stuck here all the time.

We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried.
We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line.

I've been struck down and defeated every step along the way.
Become I'm your own worst enemy when nothing seems to change.
You have to fail a thousand times before you get it straight.
So catch me if you can 'cause I ain't leaving this to fate.

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right.
We're always searching for the reason why...
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb.
We keep on getting stuck here all the time.

We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried.
We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line.

Tired of all the promises and never coming through.
Stop waiting for that moment to arrive...

We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried.
We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna leave them all behind!
We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line.

Buried in the mail before the early morning,
Under the frost that's forming,
His words are calling.
Even though alarm bells ring without a warning,
All of the clocks keep ticking,
And time keeps flowing.

Everyone that I hold dearly,
I try to keep them close,
'Cause some of them get bitten by the rabbit down the hole.
Once they walk past through the grass,
They're never coming home.

Easy to label yet so hard to nail,
Maybe They've lost their way but found their savior.
Living in a fabled life's a fairy tale,
Except our thoughts are fragile our minds are frail.

Everyone that you hold dearly,
You try to keep them close.
'Cause some of them get bitten by that rabbit down the hole.
And once you walk past through the grass,
You're never coming home.

Good god what have I done?
Mother natures lonely son.
Mother natures lonely son.
Chase that rabbit down the hole.

Wander through the open door that leads to nowhere.
Who's gonna take away my pain, take away my pain.
Before you know you're trapped inside the spiders web,
Screaming there is no escape, there is no escape.

The invitation is written clearly,
You're the one he chose.
Until the day your bitten by the rabbit down the hole.
Follow his procession deep into the ground below.

Good god what have I done?
Mother natures lonely son.
Mother natures lonely son.
Chase that rabbit down the hole.

I'll drown or I will burn.
Down the path of no return.
Down the path of no return.
Chase that rabbit down the hole.
Rabbit down the hole.

I'd never thought I'd see her suffer,
I gave her all I could.
And everything I had to offer,
Was never understood.
How many days until her mind has left this world for good?

Good god what have I done?
Mother natures lonely son.
Mother natures lonely son.
Chase that rabbit down the hole.

I'll drown or I will burn.
Down the path of no return.
Down the path of no return.
Chase that rabbit down the hole.
Rabbit down the hole.

One of these days you'll break away.
One of these days you'll break away.
One of these days you'll break away.
Chase that rabbit down the hole.
(One of these days you'll fade away.)

One of these days you'll break away.
One of these days you'll break away.
One of these days you'll break away.
Chase that rabbit down the hole.

I should have turned and walked away,
But I got tangled in your chains.
A trail of dead for all to see,
You shut the cage and stole the key.

Your state of mind revealed,
That my love for you was real.
They say in time wounds heal,
But I got nothing left to steal.

My mouth is shut.
My lips are sealed.
You are the crutch,
Of this disease.
And I've been locked in your machine.
Sit here and rot,
Or break this deal.

I spilled my blood on the checkered floor.
You got me crawling back for more.
You set the trap I'll take the bait.
Her bed of nails I cant escape.

Your state of mind revealed,
That my love for you was real.
They say in time wounds heal,
But I got nothing left to steal.

My mouth is shut.

You are the crutch,

And I've been locked in your machine.
Sit here and rot,
Or break this deal.

Now It's so dark that I can't see,
The mental scars you left on me.
So dig your nails and grind your teeth,
I'm in your clutch for eternity.

Yeah I know it's hard for you to see,
The mental scars you left on me.
So dig your nails and grind your teeth,
I'm in your clutch for eternity.

Once there was a nation here,
Now there is no more.
Once we fought to change our fears,
But now This Is Our War.

(This Is Our War!)
(This Is Our War!)

Wash you mind out, where's your morals?
How many people have to live this sorrow?
Rights should not be begged or borrowed
How many really want to change tomorrow?

We're still playing the blindfold game,
As we profile the enemy that we create, yeah.
We're still playing the blindfold game,
With the cards on the table in the end we're all the same!

Where's the compassion in the world today?!
Yeah were all the same!
until we find another way this our war!

Once there was a nation here,
Now there is no more.
(This Is Our War!)
Once we fought for change arm in arm, but
Now This Is Our War.

Divisive words from ivory towers,
Seeds of intolerance turn into flowers.
Countless fools and reckless cowards,
Rally the people in their quest for power.

We're still playing the blindfold game,
As we profile the enemy that we create, yeah.
We're still playing the blindfold game,
With the cards on the table in the end we're all the same!

Is this the land of segregation? Is this a place that we call home?
Don't let the old-stock generation carry the flag for you and me no more.
(This Is Our) WAR! This Is Our War.

We're into the red. We're into the red. And as it burns the fire spreads.
We're under the threat. We're under the threat. Will it still burn tomorrow?

Once there was a nation here,

Once we fought to change our fears,

Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb nobody cares 'till it's too late.
watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb you better pray you're somewhere safe.

Transfixed on a piss-yellow sky.
Watch another tank of gasoline burn dry.
A death stare from her cold, dead eyes.
As she's chopping up the carrot, sharpening the knives.
Don't blink keep your eyes on the prize.
While your rip me up to pieces, cut me down to size.
Don't dare try to keep it inside.
Cause the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.

Just when you thought you've seen it all.
A storm awaits behind the door.
Disgruntled right down to the core.
We still go on.

Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb nobody cares 'till it's too late.
watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb you better pray you're somewhere safe.

Beat down like a slave to the grind.
I got a rocket launcher going off inside my mind.
Dark clouds bottled up inside.
Every thought about the future leaves me terrified.
I'm sick of the same old lies.
Why don't you talk about your feelings? Who gives a shit about mine?
Death grips got a thorn in my side.
Because the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.

Just when you thought you've seen it all.
A storm awaits behind the door.
Disgruntled right down to the core.
We still go on.

Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the time bomb nobody cares 'till it's too late.
Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the time bomb you better pray you're somewhere safe.

Oh we got a time bomb ticking away inside,
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.

Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.

You're watching the time bomb ticking away inside,
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.
You're watching the time bomb ticking away inside,
Everybody needs a little help when the world is blind.
You're watching the time bomb ticking away inside,
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.

You're Watching the Time (Bomb Ticking Away.)
You're Watching the Time (Bomb Ticking Away.)
You're Watching the Time (Bomb Ticking Away.)
You're Watching the Time (I wont spend another day.)
You're Watching the Time (Locked up in a mental cage.)

In a garage, beside a house
There is a luxury Sedan
And for his next monthly installment
He's gonna go out with a bang

Boy who always did what he was told
Was promised to be king when he was old

Hit the brakes, hit the glass
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes from the past
Flashed before his face

There is a man, intensive care
When he awakes he will declare
"I've been dead for 20 years
I won't let 20 more go by"

Boy who always did what he was told
Bought the only dream that he was sold

Hit the brakes, hit the glass
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes from the past
Flashed before his face

Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things
That pull my spirit down

Ever feel like you've been cheated
Following what they believe?
Don't shake the hands of fate
Don't shake the hands of fate

Ever feel like you've been cheated
Following what they believe?
Don't shake the hands of fate
There's no more time to waste

Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence of my existence
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence of all these things

Face to face you'll hear them tell a different story
Loose lips may sink ships, but honesty's forever

Beware the voice without a face

Level heads prevail, revenge won't make it better

A devil in a midnight mass
He preyed behind stained glass
A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive, but now I'm singing

Silent Night for the rest of my life
Silent Night for the rest of my life
Violent Knight at the edge of your knife
"Forgive me, Father" won't make it right
Silent Night for the rest of my life
Silent Night at the edge of your knife
You're guilty

A devil in a midnight mass
Killed the boy inside the man
The holy water in his hands
Can never wash away his sins

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Put my trust in God that day
Not the man that taught his way
I was alive, but now I'm singing

Silent Night for the rest of my life
Silent Night for the rest of my life
Violent Knight at the edge of your knife
"Forgive me, Father" won't make it right
Silent Night for the rest of my life
Silent Night at the edge of your knife
You're guilty

Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound
Your bed is made, it's in the ground
Whisper, whisper don't make a sound
Your bed is made, it's in the ground

Whisper, whisper, don't make a sound
Your bed is made, it's in the ground

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride until the coast
To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searchin' for somethin' I couldn't find at home

Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I'll be fine
I swear to God this'll be my one last time

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat ya down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

When it gets dark in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head will soon be fed
By the vultures that circle round the dead

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat ya down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I never once thought I'd ever be caught
Starin' at sidewalks, hidin' my track marks
I left my best friends or did they just leave me?

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

All we shared was a mattress
And a lie, and an address
Baby, I don't need you
Well baby, I don't need you

Once occupied by a goddess
Now it's a room full of boxes
She said, "It's time to leave you"
But baby, I don't need you

In a perfect worl her face would not exist
In a perfect world a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world this wouldn't make me sick

I never got the whole story
Not 'til after she left me
Baby, I don't need you
Well baby, I don't need you

Word on the street is she fucked him
While we were playing in Cleveland
Well baby, I don't need you
You're fading in my rearview

In a perfect world her face would not exist
In a perfect world a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world this wouldn't make me sick

Never understood how she could
Mean so little to so many
Why does she mean everything to me?

Is it worth the pain
With no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Questioning her good intention
Jealousy's a bad invention
When you push on glass it's bound to break

Even when she was defensive
It just gave me more incentive
The more you squeeze, the more it slips away

I never walked so far
On a lonely street
With no one there for me
Is it worth the pain
With no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Accept this confession
I'm walking on pins and needles
You're not my possession
I'm walking on pins and needles
My conscience is vicious
I'm walking on pins and needles
And I'm begging forgiveness
I'm walking on pins and needles

I never walked so far
On a lonely street
With no one there for me
It took too long to see
Her in misery
And now it's clear to me
That it's worth the pain
Always take the blame
For all your own insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

She reads a book from across the street
Waiting for someone that she'll never meet
Talk over coffee for an hour or two, she
Wonders why I'm always in a good mood

Killin' time before she struts her stuff
She needs supporting, I'll become the crutch
She'll never know how much she means to me
I play the game but I'm the referee

Surrender every word, every thought every sound
Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown
Surrender all the pain we've endured until now
Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found
Surrender yourself to me

Even though I know what I'm lookin' for
She's got a brick wall behind her door
I'd travel time and confess to her
But I'm afraid she'd shoot the messenger

Surrender every word, every thought every sound
Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown
Surrender all the pain we've endured until now
Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found
Surrender yourself to me

I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me

I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me
This flower don't belong to me
Why can't she belong to me?

Every word, every thought, every sound
Every touch, every smile, every frown
All the pain we've endured until now
All the hope that I lost you have found

Surrender every word, every thought, every sound
Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown
Surrender all the pain we've endured until now
Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found

I never had the nerve to ask (surrender)
Has my moment come and passed (surrender)
I never had the nerve to ask (surrender)
Has my moment come and passed (surrender)
I never had the nerve to ask (surrender)
Has my moment come and passed (surrender)
I never had the nerve to ask (surrender)

A slap in the face
And I can't erase
These things that you say
Don't make it all okay, it's not okay

When push comes to shove
I'll put on the gloves
Intentions are cruel
I ain't nobody's fool, you know

It hurts my pride, step aside
'Cause I don't need your

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me
Misery
That's what you're giving me
Sympathy
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down

A fistful of lies
Dressed up in disguise
And make no mistake
I know they're all so fake, they're all so fake

My self-righteous friend
I just can't pretend
Your words are the truth
Sincere only when they suit you

It hurts my pride, step aside
'Cause I don't need your

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me
Misery
That's what you're giving me
Sympathy
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me
Misery
This shit is killing me
Sympathy
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down
Breaking me down

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me
Misery
That's what you're giving me
Sympathy
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me
Misery
This shit is killing me
Sympathy
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down
Breaking me down
Breaking me down

Time rolling along with the waves
A thousand miles away
Holding you close in the rain
Seems just like yesterday

Lost hope in a faraway place
And in my hand remains
A black and white print of a face
I'll never see again

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
Cut down like lambs at slaughter
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Love served until death do us part
I'm drifting in the dark
Wounded and wishing to fall
Into your faithful arms

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
Cut down like lambs at slaughter
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Beneath the sky of hate
Beyond the sea of pain
In heaven I will wait
Until we meet again

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
Cut down like lambs at slaughter
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
Cut down like lambs at slaughter
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Like a target drawn across my chest
She's a bullet in Russian Roulette
You said you'd never turn your back on me (rescue me, rescue me)
Would you stand by me and bury me? (bury me)

Why don't we end this lie
I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find
My broken mind before it falls to pieces

Every time (this suffering)
You tried to leave me blind (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

And when she spins the bottle round and round
Every time it leaves me gagged and bound
You said you'd never turn your back on me (rescue me, rescue me)
Would you stand by me and bury me? (bury me)

Why don't we end this lie
I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find
My broken mind before it falls to pieces

End this lie (this suffering)
I can't pretend this time (this suffering)
I need a friend to find (this suffering)
My broken mind, before it falls to pieces

Every time (this suffering)
You tried to leave me blind (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

Misery won't get the best of me
'Cause now I'm calling, yes, I'm calling on your bluff
Misery won't get the best of me
'Cause now I'm calling, yes, I'm calling on your bluff
Throw down the cards, I've had enough

Why don't we end this lie
I can't pretend this time
I need a friend to find
My broken mind before it falls to pieces

Every time (this suffering)
You tried to leave me blind (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

End this lie (this suffering)
I can't pretend this time (this suffering)
I need a friend to find (this suffering)
My broken mind before it falls to pieces

Every time (this suffering)
You tried to leave me blind (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes (this suffering)
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

Urban Hipster, the new gangster...; frontin' by the club
A new wave mannequin packin' haircuts, instead of packin' guns
Magazines from overseas, won't teach you how to feel
They trade in their hearts for indie rock charts to tell them what is real

When did they assume...; putting on a costume?
Gave them a right to...; ostracize
Out of the woodwork...; art aficionados
Answer one question...;

Where is the line? Where is the line?
Between your fashion and your mind
Where is the line? Where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!
Where is the line? Where is the line?
To be yourself is not a crime
Where is the Line? Where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind!

She sells street cred with no smile, at the local record store
She's acting the role and dressing the part, pretending to be bored
The truth about conformity, is it bites without a sting
Trends come and go, but when your alone it doesn't mean a thing

When did they assume...; putting on a costume?
Gave them a right to...; ostracize
Out of the woodwork...; art aficionados

March on, worker bees
Know your enemy

We take our orders given by the queen
We're not the killers, we're the worker bees
If you resist us, you will feel our sting
Surrender now before the swarm sets in

Protect the hive from enemies
Protect the hive from enemies
Follow the herd mentality
Can we fight to save our souls?

March on, worker bees
Know your enemy

A pollination coming from the west
And in a flash we will invade your nest
Supply of honey flowing bottomless
Play by our rules or you'll be powerless

Protect the hive from enemies
Protect the hive from enemies
Follow the herd mentality
Can we fight to save our souls?

And we'll march along with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride the rails with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord above forgive what we've done?
Can we fight to save our souls?

And we'll march along with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride the rails with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord above forgive what we've done?
Can we fight to save our souls?
Can we fight to save our souls?

And we'll march along with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride the rails with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord above forgive what we've done?

And we'll march along with our blindfolds on

Can we fight to save our souls?
Can we fight to save our souls?
Will we die to save our home?

I stumble through the wreckage, rusted from the rain
There's nothing left to salvage, no one left to blame
Among the broken mirrors, I don't look the same
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

Dissect me 'til my blood runs down into the drain
My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
I'm nothing but a tin man, don't feel any pain
I don't feel any pain, I don't feel any pain
I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power, beat me with your chains
And if I'm the king of cowards, you're the queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

You hung me like a picture, now I'm just a frame
I used to be your lap dog, now I'm just a stray
Shackled in the graveyard, left here to decay
Left here to decay, left here to decay
I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power, beat me with your chains
And if I'm the king of cowards, you're the queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain
I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power, beat me with your chains
And if I'm the king of cowards, you're the queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power, beat me with your chains
And if I'm the king of cowards, you're the queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain
Oh, the sun will shine again, I'm rusted from the rain
I'm rusted from the rain, oh, the sun will shine again

Potent is the flow which is wicked sick
So hos of those that pounce bounce slow on the dick
Potent is the flow which is wicked sick
So hos of those that pounce bounce slow on the dick

I don't give a shit about celebrity
But motherfuckers did ya happen to see who's here? me
The bottom feeder at the top of the food chain
Frontin' from the back of the line on some dude named
After car parts that as fast as a spark hitting gas
Starts a fire gets wired from barbs that
Cut like a jalapeno popper fart
Burnin' up an asshole that once ripped apart
Punched hard but it ain't like I ever cared if I went
Too far as stitches left scars from more clowns bent
Outta shape than the Cirque du Soleil ever had so
Though he throws his weight around he's still in my shadow
In the dark so he doesn't know his girl remarked that I make her
Laugh on the inside but I can hear it later
With my dick as her other cunt gets screwed
In the process I got to get hot chicks nude

The payback is cum in fools' circles if it's
Those turnin' on those turnin' on the bitches
The payback is cum in fools' circles if it's
Those turnin' on those turnin' on the bitches

Balls out my life is a slut
This dick don't hit the bottom but I fuck the sides up
Balls out my life is a slut
This dick don't hit the bottom but I fuck the sides up

Potent is the flow which is wicked sick
So hos of those that pounce bounce slow on the dick
Potent is the flow which is wicked sick
So hos of those that pounce bounce slow on the dick

Thanks to you bitches I got more screams
Than David Arquette's resume what that means
Is my job involves getting' mobbed like John Gotti
Dressed to kill like I'm Gianni Versace
But I gotta be so when a gimp limps back for more
In a huff like that fat kid that had to sit out for
Every gym class due to his asthma that wore
One correctional shoe but still passed that I swore
I spotted at the smorgasbord sprintin' for seconds
That I reckon ain't as sloppy as the leftovers gettin'
Me clocked by blocked cock pissed my tryst with his missus
Got her panties in a bunch just like his is
That my face between her legs? because that could be
What convinced this dick getting' hard I'm a pussy
But if that were my name I would have autographed her breasts with
Motherfuckin' dollar signs instead of S's

The payback is cum in fools' circles if it's
Those turnin' on those turnin' on the bitches
The payback is cum in fools' circles if it's
Those turnin' on those turnin' on the bitches

Balls out my life is a slut
This dick don't hit the bottom but I fuck the sides up
Balls out my life is a slut
This dick don't hit the bottom but I fuck the sides up
Balls out my life is a slut
This dick don't hit the bottom but I fuck the sides up
Balls out my life is a slut
This dick don't hit the bottom but I fuck the sides up
Balls out my life is a slut
This dick don't hit the bottom but I fuck the sides up
Balls out my life is a slut

It always sucks refolding the kind of map
Needed when I get stuck where the sun don't shine the fact
Is if I just shut up, my rubbered stamp could flag you as dumb

It ain't your mind you're givin' me a piece of
As it don't take Einstein to know that's just obscene but
It's been Buck Rogers time since I hit other than rock bottom

Even the odds of having you against me
With your crotchless jihad on blue balls evidently
Are all mighty good god, so angel dust my soul like James Brown

Street legal whore hauling so much stunning ass
Sell yourself short like Bridget at the bunny ranch
Do it all fours, the satisfaction of getting fouled

I'm the least you could do
If only life were as easy as you
I'm the least you could do, oh yeah
If only life were as easy as you
I would still get screwed

I don't care if getting under someone that's
Beneath you fits the M.O. of conundrum as
You reckoned this was just a fancy word for rubbers

I aim to get a bang out of working your
Weak spot that sets the bar so low just nerve can score
With no respect, since, oddly, danger feels like pay dirt

I'm the least you could do
If only life were as easy as you
I'm the least you could do, oh yeah
If only life were as easy as you

We are Z. Cavaricci
We are laser removed
Tasmanian devil tattoos

We are third string, we are puck
We are special people's club
We are the half shirts with
Irreverent spring break top ten lists

We are munsoned, we are squat
We are flashing twelve o'clock
We are spread out buttcheeks
Pulled apart so just the air leaks

We are ishtar, we are tab
We are "no right turn on red"
We are the moustaches
The Beatles grew when they dropped acid

You are the heart dotting "I"
In the word "apologize"
Scribbled drunk on a postcard
Sent from somewhere volcanoes are
I am the heart with no name
Airbrushed on the license plate
Of a Subaru that was
Registered in Pennsylvania

We are zima, we are barf
We are cinderblock yard art
We are Baldwin brothers
Not the good one, but the others

We are Amway, we are shemp
We are Sir David of Brent
We are the queef after
A pornstar breaks the gangbang record

You are the heart dotting "I"
In the word "apologize"
Scribbled drunk on a postcard
Sent from somewhere volcanoes are
I am the heart with no name
Airbrushed on the license plate

Eventide rise for ritual
With the thrill of a kill vengefully the engine will
Roar forth steer the dead leave forced
Driven by fear shift gears veer towards
The foolishly equipped swift these
Failed bids breathed taillights from the crypt
Reflect upon the way beyond redemption
Let the necronometer beckon for the destined
Blessed when first lent sin then condemned to bear the burden
Of this curse the consequence of which can never be averted
Each tormented attempt that is made in vain
To evade this debt which is certain to be paid
Without question is met with a counterclocked surge
In reverse as if backmasked words of the black mass were
All heard by a clutch engaged
Over trails blazed to the western gates

(Ville Valo)
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Heaven may be running on empty yet the devil rides
Hell burns by angel turns her pillow to the cooler side
Something diabolical

Idle hands are bound for the
Damned once sam went down to georgia
Speed was forged of the divine salt
Mined from the vaults of flame by the lost
Named as those sought as fault rests beneath
The wrong that was spawned from the tired screech
Of essence halted engulfed in the scent of exhaustion
A false witness with the sensed end is brought
To bended knees when abandoned belief in
The mephistophelian plea for wicked unleashed sends
Heed to reap grim an infernally decreed
Reposession vested in the fallen called on to retrieve
Meed with the fueled intention of deprived intervention
The thundered calm that comes from the rattle of descension
Numbs the panicked from a havoc that reeks of oil
Barreling down this mortal coil

als dich zum ersten mal sah damals in der achten
trugst du 'ne echte rolex und 'ne rayban und wir dachten
alle scheisse was geht'n?
denn du warst zwar ein looser in der schule
aber dafür hundertmal cooler als wir alle zusammen
auf'm pausenhof mit pieper ständig dicht
als ich noch nichtmal wusste was peace war
ein kleiner dealer der im anzug von armani steckte
und ich der kleine spießer der in deinen augen gar nichts checkte
ich hab mir wirklich früher nichts dabei gedacht
aber heute muß ich sagen du hast es weit gebracht
der erste in der klasse mit 'nem eigenen auto
du hattest völlig recht du schaffst es ja genauso
ohne schulabschluss wolltest dein eigener chef sein
richtig kohle machen stiegst dicke ins geschäft ein
damals schon mit handy auf allen klassenfotos
du sagtest immer abitur wofür denn wieso bloß sollte ich studieren
wer will denn heut noch akademiker
ich streng' mich doch nicht an und verdien' am ende weniger
auf den kopf gefallen warst du ja noch nie
heute backst du deine brötchen in der gastronomie
und deine mutter kann stolz sein was sie fürn sohn hat
alle stehen bei dir schlange mitarbeiter des monats
warst du schon nach acht wochen und die chickenwings
schmecken mir noch viel besser seitdem du sie mir bringst

wenn ich dich seh' geht es mir auf einmal wieder gut
wenn ich dich treffe ergibt mein leben wieder sinn
und dabei dachten alle aus dir würde mal was werden
daß ich nicht lache daß konnte ja nicht stimmen

du bist nicht mehr der den ich von früher einmal kenn'
der hochbegabte erste gitarrist unserer schülerband
ein guter sänger ein zweiter axl rose
ich weiß noch wie du mal gesagt hast du lächelst bloß
über mich das rappen über mein outfit die weiten hosen
und beim allerersten auftritt von blumentopf
hast du dich fast angepißt vor lachen
damals dachten alle du würdest es schaffen
hattest große pläne sahst dich schon als star
ich schnitt teppiche bei domäne und jedesmal wenn ich dich sah
hast du von deinen erfolgen erzählt und alle hingen an deinen lippen
doch wenn ich dich heute treff' dann schnorrst du meine kippen
aber das ist okay ich warte eh nur auf die frage wie's mir geht
ja ich lach' in mich herein und sage
gestern waren wir in köln acht stunden autobahn
auftritt vor tausend leuten viele wollten autogramm
und danach ab ins hotel mit pay-tv und minibar
andere machen ferien auf'm bauernhof ich mach urlaub als teeniestar
und was machst du? ach mal dies mal das
mit dem singen hab ich aufgehört und hoff' das ich es schaff
rave-dj zu werden hier hör mal cooler sound
ich nahm den kopfhörer und war gar nicht mal erstaunt
über das was ich hörte aber mir ist noch schlecht
denn im walkman lief die thunderdome sechszehn

wenn ich dich seh' geht es mir auf einmal wieder gut
wenn ich dich treffe ergibt mein leben wieder sinn
und dabei dachten alle aus dir würde mal was werden
daß ich nicht lache daß konnte ja nicht stimmen

ich schau dich mit 'nem breiten grinsen an und kann's kaum glauben
ich hab von dir immer noch das bild von früher vor den augen
ich hab dich oft gesehen aber nur im birkenstock
an warmen tagen barfuß und ich fragte mich wirklich oft
wieviele läuse leben wohl in deinen haaren
weil sie immer fettig und total verfilzt waren
du der öko der nie die gesetze dieser welt versteht
hast immer tee getrunken und die kleider selbst genäht
und einen abend in der woche gingst du zur antifa
auf jeder demo warst du bis zum schluß da egal wie lang sie war
hast heftig demonstriert für asyl und ausländer
ich hatte wirklich hoffnung daß du später mal die welt veränderst
ich weiß noch kapitalismus war dein größter feind
doch wenn ich dich jetzt anschau war das wohl nicht ernst gemeint
reden wir nicht mehr drüber denn ich glaube diese zeit ist um
also ich hätte da 'ne kleine überweisung
ein richtig cooles bild du in der bank hinter'm schalter
und wirklich ein beachtlicher schnauzer für dein alter

wenn ich dich seh' geht es mir auf einmal wieder gut
wenn ich dich treffe ergibt mein leben wieder sinn
und dabei dachten alle aus dir würde mal was werden
daß ich nicht lache daß konnte ja nicht stimmen

If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see from me if her hair is hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
So many times I've thought and prayed
In the darkness of my night
And the brightness of my days

So if you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

Du bist ein einsamer Wurm - so steht es niedergeschrieben
aus einer anderen Zeit - da bist Du übrig geblieben
bist an Orten gewesen wo die Tränen wohnen
durch die Fratze der Hässlichkeit sich die Menschen belohnen
Du hast Geschichte erlebt - hast um dein Leben getanzt
und Geschichten erzählt - dich an der Bar verschanzt
deine Welt alter Helden, aufgeschrieben in Sagen
oder sind es bloß Märchen die nicht mal Kinder ertragen

Die Zeit läuft weiter und soll ich dein schärfster Richter sein?
halt sie nicht an, spring einfach auf sonst bleibst Du ganz allein
schau dich nur um wieviele Menschen dir die Hände reichen

Im dunklen Todesstreifen hast du die Liebe genossen
und durch rosarote Wolken auf die Engel geschossen
doch das Leben geht weiter und du hast schlecht gezielt
und für wen hast du dir deine Finger blutig gespielt?
die falschen Bücher im Schrank - du bist studiert und frustriert
bis zum Grunde deines Glases völlig emanzibiert
durchs Labyrinth der Gefühle bist du einfach gerannt
den Rest ersparn wir uns - es ist doch alles bekannt

als er noch ein Junge war,
war seine Zukunft längst schon klar
sein Ego war ihm wohl bekannt,
er spielte gern für sich allein
und hielt die Fäden in der Hand

die Macht in ihm wuchs langsam an
und irgendwann fasst er den Plan
sein Herz war gut - er war kein Schwein
doch will er ganz allein regier'n
will euch ein guter König sein

ein guter König, will er euch sein
du kleiner König hast es schwer
dennoch dein Volk liebt dich so sehr

nun, seinen Freunden viel es schwer
dennoch sein Volk liebt ihn so sehr
er herrschte mild in einer Zeit
mit vielen Feinden und viel Neid
in der man "Dummheit" ganz groß schreibt

doch war die Last für ihn zu schwer
man wollte keinen König mehr
sein kleines Reich, es stürzte ein
am Schluß wollt' keiner bei ihm sein
der kleine König starb allein...

Der Hammer fällt und keiner merkt was um ihn rum geschieht
Und plötzlich stehst du einsam da, wenn man dich ignoriert
Die Welt muss sich um Schlipse dreh'n, die Sonne ist nur da
Um Leut' wie euch zu blenden, und das kann sie gut - fürwahr

Wir sind zu klein um uns zu wehren, doch wir warten weiter ab
Denn ganz am Schluß holt euch die Zeit ein und wir pissen euch auf's Grab

Wir hatten nie "no future" und wir glaubten an die Zeit
Wir schoben alles vor uns her bis 5-vor-Ewigkeit
Mit rotem Stern und schwarzem Blitz sind wir stolz rumgerannt
Doch viel zu viele Pharisäer gibt es hier im Land

Zu viele wollten was verändern - doch keiner wusst' wie's geht
Wahrscheinlich weil Herr Geht-So-Nicht an jeder Ecke steht
Ich zog den Hut vor Helden - heute fällt's mir eher schwer
Die sind viel zu fett geworden, denen glaubt doch keiner mehr...

eure Mittelklasse kotzt mich sowas an
die muß man Samstags schön polieren
und Nachbar's Rasen ist zu lang
wir werden uns doch nicht blamieren
Jägerzäune schützen vor Verstand
am besten gar nicht zu viel wissen
was ist nur los in meinem Land
ich will nicht mehr im sitzen pissen

eure Mauern brachen, doch die Herzen nicht
und keiner braucht's groß zu verschweigen
brauner Schlumpf im Technokummerland
- gasch! gasch! - wir werden's allen zeigen
wozu wird hier noch wer gefragt
es geht uns blendend nach den Wahlen
die Märchensteuer wird verlangt
doch die werd' ich euch nicht bezahlen

deine Bücher sagen mir

Keep the noise low, she doesn't wanna blow it
Shake from head to toe while your left hand do the show me around
Quickens your heartbeat, beats me straight into the ground

You don't recover from a night like this
A victim still lying in bed, completely motionless
A hand moves in the dark to a zipper
Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets barely whisper
This is so messed up

Upon arrival, the guests had all stared
Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs
No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch
Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships

(Up the stairs)
He keeps his hands low, he doesn't wanna blow it
(The station where)
He's wet from head to toe, and his eyes give her the up and the down
(The act becomes)
His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up
(The art of growing up)
But the body on the bed beckons forward and he starts growing up

The fever, the focus
The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell
Die young and save yourself
The tickle, the taste of
It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up
Die young and save yourself

She hits the lights, this doesn't seem quite fair
Despite everything he learned from his friends
He doesn't feel so prepared
She's breathing quiet and smooth, he's gasping for air

"This is the first and last time," he says
She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his
He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels...; like

He is the lamb, she is the slaughter
She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her
Nothing that he tells her's really having an effect
He whispers that he loves her but she's probably only looking for s...;

(Up the stairs)
So much more than he could ever give
(The station where)
A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship
(The act becomes)
He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
(The art of growing up)
He waits for it to end and for the achin' in his guts to subside

The fever, the focus
The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell
Die young and save yourself
The tickle, the taste of
It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up
Die young and save yourself

Up the stairs
The station where
The act becomes
The art of growing up

The fever, the focus
The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell
Die young and save yourself
The tickle, the taste of
It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up
Die young and save yourself

If it makes you less sad
I will die by your hand
I hope you find out what you want
I already know what I am

And if it makes you less sad
We'll start talking again
You can tell me how vile
I already know that I am

I'll grow old
Start acting my age
I'll be a brand new day
In a life that you hate

A crown of gold
A heart that's harder than stone
And it hurts a whole lot
But it's missed when it's gone

Call me a safe bet
I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes you can forget

If it makes you less sad
I'll move out of the state
You can keep to yourself
I'll keep out of your way

And if it makes you less sad
I'll take your pictures all down
Every picture you paint
I will paint myself out

It's cold as a tomb
And it's dark in your room
When I sneak to your bed
To pour salt in your wounds

So call it quits
Or get a grip
You say you wanted a solution
But you just wanted to be missed

Call me a safe bet
I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes you can forget
So you can forget
You can forget

You are calm and reposed
It lets your beauty unfold
Pale white like the skin stretched over your bones
Spring keeps you ever close
You are second hand smoke
You are so fragile and thin
Standing trial for your sins
Holding on to yourself the best you can
You are the smell before rain
You are the blood in my veins

Call me a safe bet
I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes you can forget

We saw the western coast
I saw the hospital
Nurse the shoreline like a wound
Reports of lover's tryst
Were neither clear nor descript
We kept it safe and slow
The quiet things that no one ever knows

So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired
Today's the day we drop down
Gave up my body in bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals

I contemplate the day we wed
Your friends are boring me to death
Your veil is ruined in the rain
By then it's you I can do without
There's nothing new to talk about
And though our kids are blessed
Their parents let them shoulder all the blame

So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired
Today's the day we drop down
Gave up my body in bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals

I lie for only you
And I lie well
Hallelu
I lie for only you
And I lie well
Hallelu

So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired
Today's the day we drop down
Gave up my body in bed

She was just seventeen, pious and pretty with a deadly disease
And the weight of the world on a prosthetic shoulder
And by the summer of '96, her body was cracked like porcelain
Just like some Precious Moments collectable
In a hospital gown and a big bright golden halo

And so three cheers for my morose and grieving pals
And now let's hear it for the tears that I've welled up
We've come too far to have to give it all up now
We live lives that are rich and blessed
And we burn for how we transgress

Now I've mastered the art
Of the open casket prayer and the singing guitar
I found the rewards weren't half what I'd hoped for
And meanwhile, we all feigned hope and mirth
As her parents went on and lied to her
All about the success of the surgeries
And how my ex-girlfriend was now sleeping with her fiancé

And so three cheers for my morose and grieving pals
And now let's hear it for the tears that I've welled up
We've come too far to have to give it all up now
We live lives that are rich and blessed
And we burn for how we transgress

If there's any justice in heaven, then God won't let me in
He'll lock the gates and take my weekend pass away
With a sympathetic wave, they'll see me off, return my golden crown
While I am cursed to walk the earth for a millennia
I know I deserve worse but it terrifies me and I can't take it any more

And so three cheers for my morose and grieving pals
And now let's hear it for the tears that I've welled up
We've come too far to have to give it all up now
We live lives that are rich and blessed
And we burn for how we transgress

So the air's gettin' colder
And the news keeps us scared
I still wrestle this summer
From the bones of our tired, blistered hands
'Cause tonight we got drinks
With just a couple of friends
And the girl that my brother likes is finally talkin' to him
And his chest is all swelled like he's proud and happy
Like he's got a great idea
Like he's makin' a memory

Wake up
And come out to the car
There's an east swell comin'
And it's howlin' offshore
And we'll be
Lyin' like lions out in the sand
But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands

So we make jokes back home
And we lighten the mood
But growing up my parents saw
What sending a kid to fight can really do
And now with the war, I can tell they're a little shook up
'Cause just a few mothers' sons will never really be enough
Not till half of our names are etched out in the wall
And the other half ruined from the things we saw

Wake up
And come out to the car
There's an east swell comin'
And it's howlin' offshore
And we'll be
Lyin' like lions out in the sand
But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands

Wake up
And come out to the car
There's an east swell comin'
And it's howlin' offshore
And we'll be

But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands

Well I wrote your name and burned it
To see the color of the flame
And it burned out the whole spectrum
As if you were everything
Mine just burned gold
A normal flame
I am not anything

And all that I remember is the feeling of waking up
When we were kids, you were the sun to which my eyes would not adjust
We were kids, I was a fountain
You could never drink enough

Then came all the boys who swept you up
Played careless with your heart
And every night there was a new girl
Sitting beside me in my car

Something dies when you grow older
But you do the best you can
I am glad
I am glad
You found a good man

I, I am feeling like a veteran
Uncompensated for the blood I've left to pool on foreign grounds
And I sometimes reach to rub at aching legs
But they've been dust for over a decade
And you're the limb I've lost, but somehow I still feel

Until I wake, we just hope that you made it
We hope that you're celebrating with people you've missed
And burning like a beacon, guiding our ship around this hellish shoal
I'm happy to admit that maybe I am a little depressed 'cause I'm missing you to death

And now there's only records of my memory
It's a little thing you gave posthumously
The details all dragged out
To think of all the paintings we could be without
If Van Gogh had gone and died face down from loss of blood the night he went and hacked his ear off

Until I wake, we just hope that you made it
We hope that you're celebrating with people you've missed
And burning like a beacon, guiding our ship around this hellish shoal
I'm happy to admit that maybe I am a little depressed 'cause I'm missing you to death

Until I wake, we just hope that you made it
We hope that you're celebrating with people you've missed
And burning like a beacon, guiding our ship around this hellish shoal
I'm happy to admit that maybe I am a little depressed 'cause I'm missing you to death

Until I wake, we just hope that you made it
We hope you're as decorated as the day that you left

I can barely move
I can barely see where we're going now
The road is washed out from the river that flooded just north of town

We stick stick stick stick to the plan we laid out
But we know the saying
The best best best best plans of both mice and men can go terribly wrong
And they probably will

So please, nobody speaks
Nobody get any smart ideas
If we don't have any heroics
We may just get out of here
And home to your families by dinner time safely and soundly sleeping
'Cause we don't want trouble
We'll take what we came for and we'll leave quiet
Or maybe we will...

Tear you up
Take what you love
And burn it down
Burn it down

Nobody moves, nobody moves
And no one gets hurt
If nobody opens their mouth
We have nothing to worry about

We'll keep keep keep keep you alive
'Cause we always need bargaining chips
(For their lives, we will trade you and make your getaway)
We'll keep keep keep keep you alive
'Cause you're pretty
And we need something to look at while we...

Tear you up
Take what you love
And burn it down
And burn it down

You swear to build
We swear to come
And burn it down
And burn it down

Weighing the cost of the love you made
Measure again, yeah
Feeling the weight of the bones you break
Break them again, yeah

Wandering the park
And sinking our teeth into anyone who'll suffice
And who can survive my disease

Break all the locks without the combination
I know where you hid it, I consider it mine
Went to the crowns without a planning or feeling
And keep me alert till the next bout of time

Please cut me up, cut me up
Honey, make me the lover you wanted
When you were young and asleep
And I'm fine when you're here
Find my call from a bottle
The lover you wanted
While you waited so long

Weighing the cost of the love you made
Measure again, yeah
Feeling the weight of the bones you break
Break them again, yeah

Weighing the cost of the love you made
Measure again, yeah
Feeling the weight of the bones you break
Break them again, yeah

Weighing the cost of the love you made
Measure again, yeah
Feeling the weight of the bones you break
Break them again, yeah

Weighing the cost of the love you made
Measure again, yeah
Feeling the weight of the bones you break
Break them again, yeah

How does everything start and end?
Come gather now and lay this beast to rest
I kept hearing trumpets, got my hearing checked
Your father spoke a prophecy
To think that I believed is self-centered of me
There was something that I was trying to say
But then I choked on it and now it's getting kinda late

We walked to the edge but we never leapt,
What sings to you when you disconnect

Written on the wall, the letters plain and tall,
This is my own fault
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything

I still cower at eternal wrath though
Don't want my fear to become my shadow
I want to evade my thoughts, I want to die in Kyoto

The ocean never sleeps or dreams,
It never stops to ponder what it sees
Committed to its satellite, no one can move you man and no one's ever going to try.

All the tides are married to the moon
All i want is for my heart to be as true

Written on the wall, the letters plain and tall
This is my own fault
We don't feel anything
Not gone but fading fast
So let me put to rest
The only question that you'll ask

We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything
We don't feel anything

Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?
Do you believe in anything?
Do you carry it around just to burn things down?

Meet me tonight on the turnpike, my darling
'Cause we believe in everything
If we sweat all these debts, then we're sure to drown
So we strap ourselves up to this engine now
With a god who we found laying under the back seat

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You were freezing over hell
You were bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

(Help)
All that you've got is to ignore the things, that I was sorry
And sweep me under the rug
While you're beating with a book everyone, the book tells you to love

There is an ember in the heart of the kiln
And it's burning hot with love
Burning out my sins until there's nothing but dust
Holding me with care into your cigarette
'Cause the god I believe in, he worked on a campaign trail

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You were freezing over hell
You were bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?
Do you believe in anything?
Do you carry it around just to burn things to the ground?

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You were freezing over hell
You were bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Feels like
(What did you learn tonight?)
We could escape the armor
(You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing)
I might throw it away
For fear of the silver sun
(You're a voice that never sings, is what I say)

If you try
(You were freezing over hell)
Running a maze of your lies
(You were bringing on the end, you do so well)
It's too hard to save
You've thrown out everyone

Goodbye to sleep
I think this staying up is exactly what I need

We'll take apart your head
We'll take apart the counting
And the flock it has bred

Goodbye to love
That's alright
I will push you all up
Right against the wall

(Does everybody really wanna know the meaning of the word love?
And do you really think you're a part of me?
And is your army ready to take on one of the 144,000?
Or will you declare war on the loony bin?)
Take my head
(Right against the wall)
Chew it up and swallow it

Your blue blood is now running
I fell asleep in the alkaline
I can't shake this little feeling
I'll never get anything right

Goodbye you liar
Well, you sipped from the cup but you don't own up to anything
Then you think you will inspire?

(But now your note really got me worried about this now, and your baby girl
Do you really feel I'm in the Old Testament?
Or will we celebrate with flowers? Or with fire and brimstone?
I just don't know, and yeah; I admit, I'm afraid of the reckoning)

(Take my head)
And I wish I could inspire
(Take apart the demon
In the attic
To the left)

(Goodbye, my love
Don't burn out love
He'll cut your throat
It's not your fault, girl
Shake him off you now!
That's in the trial)
Her blue blood is now running
I fell asleep in the alkaline
I can't shake this little feeling

"I'll never say anything!"
(Why am I on my own for you?)
"I'll never say anything!"
(Why am I on my own for you?)
"I'll never say anything!"
(Why am I on my own for you?)
"I'll never say anything!"

Right?!
Right, my love?!

"Take me, take me back to your bed
I love you so much that it hurts my head
Say: 'I don't mind you under my skin'"
(I let the bad parts in, the bad part is in)

"Well, when we were made we were set apart
But life is a test and I get bad marks
Now some Saint got the job of writing down my sins
The storm is coming, the storm is coming in!"

Her blue blood is now running
I fell asleep in the alkaline
I can't shake this little feeling

"I never did anything!"
(Why am I alone for you?)
"I never did anything!"
(Why am I alone?!)

"Take me, take me back to your bed
I love you so much that it hurts my head
I don't mind you under my skin"
(I'll let the bad parts in, the bad part is in)

"Well, you're my favorite bird and when you sing
I really do wish that you'd wear my ring
No matter what they say I am still The King
Now the storm is coming, the storm is coming in"

I'd arrest you if I had handcuffs,
I'd arrest you if I had the time,
I'd throw you down in the back seat,
as if you'd committed a terrible crime.

I'd break in a towns worth of houses,
And rob whole families blind,
I'd do it to you like you do it to me,
If you knew you would get away fine.

I'd drown all these crying babies,
If I knew that their mothers wouldn't cry,
I'd hold them down and I'd squeeze real soft,
To let a piece of myself die.

It's hard to be the better man,
When you forget you're trying,
It's hard to be the better man.

I'd arrest you if I had handcuffs,
I'd arrest you if I had the time,
I'd wait for you outside the courtroom
And taunt you
When all your appeals were declined

I'd drive my car off of a bridge,
If I knew that you weren't inside,
With the pedal to the floor who could ask for more,
A fantastic way to kill some time.

You could lay on your back and be beaten
You could put up your fists and fight
You could try and be way off
(Way Off, Way Off, Way...way off, Way off)

It's hard be the better man,
When you forget you're trying,
It's hard to be the better man,
When you're still lying,
It's hard to be the better man,
When you forget you're trying,
It's hard to be the better man,
When you're still lying...
You're still lying

Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
The kind you'd find on someone that could save
If they don't put me away
Well, it'll be a miracle

Do you believe you're missing out
And everything good is happenin' somewhere else?
But with nobody in your bed
The night's hard to get through

And I will die all alone
And when I arrive, I won't know anyone

Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?
'Cause this problem's gonna last
More than the weekend

Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
Do I get the gold chariot?
Do I float through the ceiling?

Do I divide and pull apart?
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
And this ship went down in sight of land
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?

I know you'll come in the night like a thief
(I know this song)
But I've had some time alone, to hone my lying technique
(Breathe Eve, save that one)
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
(Eve, you're wrong, love)
But I'm scared I'll get scared, and I swear I'll try to never give up
(Everyone now)

So do you think that we could work out a sign?
So I'll know it's you and that it's over, so I won't even try
(They're all on file)
I know you're coming for the people like me
(One two three)
But we all got wood and nails
We tore down that hatin' factory

Yeah, we all got wood and nails
We tore down that hatin' factory

Yeah, we all got wood and nails
And we sleep inside of this machine

K, it's your ride
Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle
Pretend
Your garden grow, and it's your day to wed

We found your man
He's drinking up, he's all-American
And he'll drive
He's volunteered with grace to end your life

We'll tidy up
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
You explode
You firefly, you tiny boat, with oars

Feather oars
The world tilts back and pours and pours and so
You satellite
You tidal wave, you're a big surprise

And I've one more night
To be your mother

The signal interrupts
Baby's frequency not strong enough, remain
In my hands, and smile, we will miss you
But in time you'll get settled, and we will write

Hey, beauty supreme
Yeah, you were right about me
But can I get myself out from underneath
This guilt that will crush me?

And in the choir
I saw our sad messiah
He was bored and tired of my laments
Said, "I died for you one time, but never again"

Never again, never again, never again, never again
Never again, never again, never again, never again

Well, I love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again)
No, 'cause I can dish it out (Never again)
But I can't take it (Never again)

Well, I love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again)
'Cause I can dish it out (Never again)
But I can't take it (Never again)

One will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Two will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Three will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Four will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Five will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Six will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Seven loves you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it

(I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth)
Seven loves you so much
(We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
(I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd)
'Cause I can dish it out
(I should be laughing right now)
But I can't take it

(I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth)
Seven loves you so much

When I disappear do you fear for the sister I took?
When I disappear it is clear I am up to no good
I am drearily bloodletting this bedwetting cosmonaut
"Son, the last thing you'll realize you need is what you've already got"

So touch me or don't
(Just let me know
Where you've been)

Please drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait
(one two three four)
For I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake
(five six seven eight)
(the lake)
Shimmering under a moon made in anger and haste
Shimmering like a penny out of reach in the subway grating
(Shimmering like a coin kept safe away - You never listen to anything)

So touch me or don't
(Just let me know
Where you've been)

We could leave it alone,
(I'm sure there's someone who knows
Where you've been)

You could never work well with our group
Not with the faults we found
So we fixed you with cement galoshes
And no one can save you now
Unless you have friends among fish
There'll still be no air to breathe
You could drink up the entire ocean
We'll still find someone to be everything we know that you'll never be

So touch me or don't
(Just let me know
Where you've been)

Or we could leave it alone
(I'm sure there's someone who knows
Where you've been)

I used to be such a burning example
I used to be so original
I used to care, I was being cared for
Made sure I showed it to those that I love

I used to sleep without a single stir
'Cause I was about my father's work

Well take me out tonight
The ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

I used to pray like God was listening
I used to make my parents proud
I was the glue that kept my friends together
Now they don't talk and we don't go out

I used to know the name of every person I kissed
Now I've made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it

Well take me out tonight
The ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

Well throw me that lifeline
The ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

Never hit the brakes
There's no time to save him
He just ran out in the street
Anybody know his name?
I think I recognize him
Sure as hell, he paid for that mistake

Woah, woah, woah, woah

(I used to be such a burning example)
So take me out tonight

Don't feed me scraps from your bed

Don't be waves
Come to seal my fate, marine
Just pretend
That you want me

Would you be my babe?
Be my

Well don't be that note I can't hold
Well don't be that joke that I told and told 'til it got old
Don't be that hand 'round my throat so I can't breathe
(so I can't breathe)
Say you're my friend but why won't you be my family?

And if you break
Just don't tell me

Would you be my babe?

(Yeah we were solving it
Yeah we got that scene
No hand to hold arms
Won't do, I'm smart
Why don't you want me?
I'm with the enemy that came and tied my veins)

Be my serene (Tell me now)
Tell me you know what I mean (Prove me wrong)
You've set on me but you are not the sun
You are not the sun.
(Now that I know what I am)

I'm outside and your cold lips again (Put it down)

I am on the mend
At least now I can say that I am trying
And I hope you will forget
Things I still lack

Yeah
Yeah

Is it in you now
To barely hear the truth that you have spoken?
Twisted up by knaves
To make a trap for fools

Is it in you now
To watch the things you gave your life to broken?
And stoop and build them up
With worn out tools

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah oh

Nothing gets so bad
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
He whispers like a bridge
He's a river span

And take all that you have
And turn it into something you would miss if
Somebody threw that brick
Shattered all your plans

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah oh

Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah

Before you put my body in the cold ground
Take some time to warm it with your hands
Before it's coming to an end, yeah

It's coming to an end, yeah

Do you miss the blend
Of colors she left in your black and white field?
And do you feel condemned
Just being there?

I am just a man who knows how to feel
I am not your friend

Hey hey hey Mr. Hangman,
Go get your rope

Your daughters weren't careful,
I fear that I am a slippery slope
Now even if I lay my head down at night
After a day I got perfectly right

She won't know...
(no)
She won't know...

She won't know...
(no)
(NO!)

(I hear ya 2 3 4 1 What?!)

So pray, little Kay, love's God on a good day
And you can't blame your mother
She's trying not to see you as her worst mistake
And I wish that I could tell you right now "I love you"
But it looks like I won't be around
So you won't know
You won't know
You won't know
You won't know

So believe in me, believe me
If you think I'll let you down
Well, I won't
They can fire everything they've got
And when you think I'm sunk
I will float on and on
I have burned the bush that covered my life
Even though I'm scared I won't burn that bright

You won't know...
You won't know...
You won't know...

We're never going to feel as full as we felt
So let's go outside and we'll play William Tell
Take your time drawing a bead
I'll stand as still as you need
'Cause you're so good at talking smack,
You heart attack
But you're the apple of my eye anyway

My smiling face
That's on a plate
It's on a silver plate

So they say,
They say in heaven
There's no husbands and wives
On the day that I show up
They'll be completely out
Of their forgiveness supplies
And I cant use the telephone
To tell you that I'm dead and gone
So you won't know
(gone gone gone)

cause I warned you a thousand times, then you smiled at me
fall

you're falling down
under a sky so fuckin' black

This is my end, this sight was like a nightmare

I had the pictures in my head?drawn by faith and trust,
Shaped by my conviction?is this my blame
can it be so simple
I never realized it

I see my visions melting down
can not keep it in my hands
this is like a fuckin' dream

the drips of my future pulling me down
encircled by reality, I'm diving in my past
this sight was a nightmare
this sight tattered my heart into rags

open windows howling at me
I see my fears become reality
my lungs are filled by pain and sorrow
by tears and broken fuckin' aims
I hope one day we will see us again
some day

is this the end

and I ask myself
would you look at me
would you remember my face
just look me in the eyes, one last time
everthing faded to an ugly grey
I never expected an end like this

I can hear your lifeless voice, it's the voice of everyone else
containing distorted views of this sick world, called to life
from infested minds, they're taking over the space of our hearts, of our souls

can you hear my voice
can you hear my words
do you feel me now

you can't feel the masks you're wearing everyday
you can't smell the buried hearts
the sand has fallen
I don't know - was it your choice, was it your destiny
this is the beginning of the end
welcome to the war against yourself
your heart's already dead

this is the beginning of the end
welcome to the war against yourself

I can hear you speak to me
but you're eyes are still empty
you've already lost

can you hear my voice, can you hear my words
blind eyes are staring at me, knowing nothing, nothing but the lies
hold my hand or go away

staring at me - blind eyes

save our lifes,
but you're eyes are still empty

Retrace all the steps, all the things you've done to me
This is the moment where I can't control myself

You stamped your heel on my neck
You forced me to taste the poison

I'm gonna take your breath away
I'm gonna take your breath away
Can you feel me now?

This nauseating sickness creeping through
I think this can only be stopped by blood
Can you feel remorse?
Can you see my blood?

It's to late to apologize for all the things you've done to me

You couldn't catch the sickness, cure the sickness that I bleed
And now I needed you to feel the pain of my disease
This is the last impression that I'm leaving you to see
I know you needed just a reason, but the reason died
But the fuckin' reason died with me

Everyday I ask myself, how long is this to continue

My hands on my chest, they feel like a thorn deep inside me

This pain brings me down to my knees
What's behind those fuckin' walls
I hate the future
Looking for answers

My decisions are setting the track switch through the Jungle of this life
But what to do if there is more than just one right way

I never wanted that you leave me
But I saw it in your eyes, the trust was already dead
All the time I tried to cope, I said to myself, look Forward to a new chapter

This is my confession, I'm still in love with you
Could I find the way back to you
I can feel there is still hope

Let me feel your reliance and hope
Can we take this barrier together

Let me feel your hope
I wanna let go - no way
I don't wanna hear it
Now it's the point in time I always feared
I can feel the cold winds are striking my shakin' body

Not in my life, not with my heart

I hate the fate
Till now I thought it would never happen to me again
Will this break us
Those are the tears, showing me the way

This is a common crossing with just one destination
Straight into loneliness
I wanna leave this nightmare
But the door is locked
There is no light anymore

I hate the fate
This is the story of a fuckin' stranger

Hit me, let me wake up now,
Time disperses like sand in my hands
I can't believe it

I dream about the day
It goes through our hearts
Find the light.

Follow the clouds in the sky
From beneath it devours, struggle through this freezing Ocean

We will cross the cold ocean

We're dealing with a callous world
And so you need the chosen ones

Pieces of me, they just fall away
And there is nothing that I can do
Except to pray that there will come a day

I feel the screams close to my fuckin' heart
So close to my heart

But I hope the day will come when we can forget
My mind is screaming but my lips can't translate
I tremble with every breath I take
Please pick me up

So blind, pins and needles buried in my eyes

I'm dazzled by the hidden truth
it woke me up
with sharp screams, it shook me up
Is it already too late, was this the last of our fights?
Maybe just a dream

It shines so fucking bright, tears roll out of my squinted eyes
This is the cold fire, burning down my little hope
I get up, I walk down the street again, but today I'm just the observer, now I am the seeing
Watching all the zombies, I am scared by their ashamed glances

Their empty faces with these glossy eyes, trying to evade my assessment
I see them dying within, lost on the way, not ready to pay
I walk along, no one holds me back, no one blocks my path

I can read their minds, they have lost their goals, lost their dreams, lost their selves
They don't know what they are searching for now

Now they feel the consequences of their stiffened way of life, caged in their own prison of lies
Focused on the fading things, now the safety falls to dust
What is the use of all the money now, can you remember your decision?
I watch 'em pay the price for being blind, for being so narrow-minded
The final question is: what if this was just a dream?

Was it just a dream?
You blind motherfuckers

The fetters are loose now but the reddened wrists will be visible forever
I was standing on the edge, I've lost almost my spirit, my path

Something died inside me
I didn't recognize myself when I was looking in the mirror
Something has grown inside me
What have I become?
I acted too late
I should have seen it but I've gone blind more and more
I've just heard this ticking in my head
I will never feel safe anymore, nowhere
Nothing will ever gonna be the same again, nothing

The surface won't be regrinded anymore
Now I've to conceal my scars which I'm trying to heal
I felt to cry, I cried to feel
What a waste, what a dissapointment
All the things you never appreciated
Like a leech on my neck, you took my energy
The wings are broken, the roses are black

The pictures remind only of days of lightness
No one can change it, no one to blame
Just forgive, just forget

In spite of all this I refuse to give up, I won't give up

Another sleepless night, time stands still, minutes seem like hours, hours like days
I take a deep breath, open my eyes and clench my hand into a fist
All these nightmares, they hunt me for real
Running away is futile, standing still is fatal

Can't distinguish between sweat and blood anymore
Was it our fault? we knew we could fail
I feel numb from drinking our tears, but when I remember your smile I know I have to face all this fear

I enter your room, close the door, smell your perfume
It hurts like an open sore, which will bleed forever

Was it me, that ended our dreams?
Somebody please cut me out of this twisted picture
I'm floating in memories, they feel like fractures reflecting on everything, since you disappeared
If there's one moment you can choose your fate

Why didn't we grow in love, instead of ending up in a fuckin' fight
Oh god, why?! tell me why

I feel numb from drinking our tears, but when I remember your smile I know I have to face all this fear

You took the keys, started the car, drove into nowhere...with my heart
Now it all falls apart

I enter your room, close the door, whisper your name
Another sleepless night, time stands still, minutes seem like hours, hours like days

It was our fault, we knew we could fail

Looking back on my footsteps on the cold ground, feeling like fleeing

They say the path I took should be my fate, but I wanna take my lazy steps on my own
Day by day, second by second, I set the course anew

Walking through the frames of my life, looking for the moments I'll remember with a smile
Tripping over lies and hate, envy and vanity
I wish I could change the order of proceedings, no chance at all

I build a time machine, I will reverse my mistakes, pain fade away!

All these sources of noise are whispering and screaming, tempting and frightening
in the middle of my head, beyond my heart
They try to change my mind into something bad, fighting against them for years
But in the end I still decide on my own, fearing the mistakes,
fearing the responsibility to myself and to my beloved, to my beloved

These photos...
Can't overlook the flashlights, they are surrounding me, observing all my movements
But finally it's me who's crying for my perfect sincerity, crying for my salvation, crying for the respect against for myself
So where is the golden means of all decisions? Don't even know if there is a right way I could choose

I go down on my knees, I'm yelling at the ground, in the hope of finding some new answers
Thousands of questions, only one life for finding answers.
One question for thousands of lives - breathing slowly - what if
Despite this I never stopped believing in, waiting for the point I can see it clearly

The grey clouds obliterate the light blue sky, they're approaching quickly
The sloppy and filthy streets are reflecting the human condition
Everywhere I look I can only see narrow alleyways
The bridges are burning

No chance to heal the wounds, no time-out from the selfish world
The cold environment is looking at me, in hope of getting answers
I close my eyes to stop the time, to forget all this misery
Where am I? where's the place where the roses still grow?
I can't hear through these hazy words anymore
Is this the reality or just my perception?
Wait for a sign but you can't see me, through this blurred visibility
But I can see you, the fear in your face, the fluttering eyelid, you can't hide, you can't

I perceive there is a way out
There's might be a solution that cures the world

Can't you feel it? can you really see it?
So shout out, Convince me
Step up!

It was a long way, it took a long time to find a safety like this

I was almost giving up all my hope but in the end the picture in my head surpassed my expectations

A world so perfect, a world so fuckin' flawless
The search has an end, I don't need anything else other than this place, a place where I belong
Nothing is grey, even the dark clouds above me shine bright
The ocean so deep, my spirit above
No more questions, only answers
I take a deep breath, close my eyes, reach out my hand and try to stop the time to feel the perfection for longer

The warm, pleasant sunbeams on my face, the sand between my toes and the breeze in my hair
No one can take this moment away from me

Please don't take me away from this place, please don't wake me up from the place where I belong

It is the darkest night, stars invisible
The only thing I can feel is your cold fear, your shivering hands, controlling gaze
Fearing the end, awaiting the consequences as long as you are walking this path
In fact you don't have to fear the fog my friends
And I see, you already know the other side, you know the way out

But the cruel end is etched in your thoughts
Your fantasy, only able to envision the worst
You dream of a hero, helping hand, brave guardian

When you wake up you wish to wake up again
Leaving this place is what you secretly hope for

But in reality you can't run away, in the end the past will catch you all up
It's not the case that you weren't responsible
Take a look at this world, drab and reeking
Look at the dull seas, almost dead inside
Look at the toxic sky, we and the sun, no longer friends
Now there's no more excuses for walking this path
No more chances for the fucking blind
All this is making you sad, all this is making you scared

The hero is close, he can save you
He's close to you, so close to you
Reach out your hand, open your eyes
What made you not change your mind for so long?
That's right, the hero is you

I hope there is an end of this story

Everywhere I go, everytime I sleep I go around in the circle, again and again
On my way to a better life, with a free heart, a carefree mind
It's joining me through time and distance, like my fuckin' shadow

Invisible scars, caused by myself, so deep inside me
I played with the fire in my heart
It has finally caught me
They told me
It's time for change
The beauty enticed me to risk so many mistakes
Why not, why not?!
The signs were clear, the clouds were here
Who knows, maybe they're still right, maybe there will be rain again
Maybe I can forget, to forget the sadness
Just another aberration? just a delusion?

So here we go, round 3, and I'm doubtful again
The shadow of the past so dark, making my life look empty
I hope there is an end of this story

Every night I dream of the love I lived twice
Every morning I wake up with memories of things that never happened
Alone in the crowd, maybe already forgotten
I see the time is working against me
I guess I can't stop this, because it's stronger than me
Impossible to learn the lesson, as long as my heart won't listen

The circle holds me back, I am strapped down
Waiting for the day I can break through, the moment I can catch up all the love
Waiting for the day, you aren't just a dream, no!

I forget my own rules, but I still know the end of the story

What's happened to the world, what's happened to my life?
There was a time I felt safe, safe from the drossiness, safe from discomfort
No enemies No lies

Where is my soul, where are my ways, where is my heart
Over years it made me weak, it made me unpredictable
Something came across my way, it changed too many things inside me
Over years it made me weak
I saw your smile
Everything around me seems to glow but everything I touch goes out

I hold your hand, feel your breath, see your smile
I took this gift from life, not knowing what awaits me

Where is my soul, where are my ways, where is my heart
Over years it made me weak

Another step in an unknown direction, how can I be sure, how can I be sure?
Days go by, it seems to grow
It feels still right where I am
I can't see you anymore, feel you anymore
These voices are pushing me, they want me to fail
I am falling, nothing to lose, nothing to win
How could I be sure, why so sure?

I was falling for a long time
Almost everything I knew became more fucking worthless
So many promises, so much energy

All I want is silence, all I want is peace, all I want is you
No more reason for searching for what I always expected from life

New direction, new fuckin' rules
You caught me on my way to my new life
I think it's time to act selfishly

Memories of a time before distrust and pain
Perhaps a dream, perhaps a trap
But not this time, it's too different
My pulse is slowing down, my eyes are closed now
And I create a picture in my head, a picture of the time
I draw it with my mind, it's colourful and bright
It's no longer waiting, from today it's arriving
This time I can see the sky, the first time I don't look back

No more walls, no more lies, I can breathe until after the sundown
My glowing heart, just awakened perfection within reach
My sad memories, you make them look like fading dust
I am the air, I am the ground, nothing can burn me down

I really missed this feeling, now I don't fear myself anymore
Open mind, open ways, my future turns to light
Hope has come to find me, my real destination
This is the control I was waiting for, it makes me unbreakable
I remember who I am, what i was, what i've become

It's your turn right now
Let me see your steps, let me feel your hesitation
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
We know the reproach to yourself
All your reflections as an open secret
All your mistakes as a success, your tears as the pitiful disport
Your decisions make us win, follow the guide we gave you

Don't look upward, there's nothing above you, your eyes aren't qualified
Your memory is your future, can you remember your end?
We are your faith and your fear
We are your inspiration and your overload
You're all equal

This is your reality, your veiled sight
You can never see
You can put the blame on us

I see you try to grow with your scars, but you fail again and again
You can put the blame on us, this is what we expect
This makes your life so much easier, just close your eyes, follow blindly
In your deepest dreams you can see us, in your lonely hours you can feel us

This prison was built for you, you are not ready for the outside
Maybe you will never be, maybe you will never see

Nothing is more constant than change

So why don't you change within?
Positions won't change as long as you can't see the point

Till then we will keep observing you..sneering

You break me away

I can see it in your face
It seems like I'm lost in dreams
It's always the same
Everything is going to fade
Darkness is surrounding me
There's no hope, no energy, nobody who cares
I can't get out of this misery

I see, all I can see
I'm hoping for a new life
I'll just fade away
And the time can tell me that

I'm face down but no one knows
That I can't erase it
Do you feel it now?
Do you?!

I try not to hate you
Cause that's the way I've been
So it's time to payback now

I try not to hate you
But it just won't go away
Cause that's the way I've been
So it's time to payback now

Look down

Break me away.

Stop hide and seek

What have we become?
This is human error
A bloodbath with no sense in it

So finish harassing me
You're like the perfect murder

You act with no remorse
No empathy at all
But I miss your disease

Miss your disease / it's your disease
Your game, your rules

This is my system's failure / self-destructive
A throat cut of consciousness
I'm still suffocating
It was your game, your rules
I never really got a chance to win against your mania
But listen,,fuck your trip!

This time you were no crack addict

Anyway, I wish you some peace of mind
Hope you can change a bit and breath for a while...

My tears are dark like the night
I've never felt so cold like this
Break away from you
I can see the smile on your face
I spent my lifetime
Hope - I'm hoping it would come to me
We covered by a mask

I'm still alive
But without eyes
I'm dying deep within
Try to replace
Change my life
But then I suffocate

I lost the lies
I've never realized the fuckin truth
There's more in this world than I thought to see
You're nothing better
You can not hide 'cause you won't change your face
I spent my lifetime
Hope - I'm hoping it would come to me
We covered by a mask

I'm covered by a mask
You won't forget me

There is nothing I would change
Given a chance to rearrange
I wouldn't part with a single day, not today

Where is my sunrise?
Where is my horizon to begin again to descry
A new life for some hope
Because hope dies last
Regret till death
Because hope dies last

I can not hide behind a mask of utter satisfaction
I'm feeling all this

You will lose your face!

We walked such a long way together
As one device
I was shure we could realize the dreams
But the day has come, my confidence has been broken
My visions are dead
I should have seen it coming
But i have learned...;

Here comes the pain
I have expected too much
I've learned my lesson about the fellow men
Maybe it was better this fucking way

But now I try again
To realize my fucking dreams
With eyes wide open
I will not break again
It will be better this time

I wonder what you think of me
The day will come you regret it
What you have done to me
I hope the destiny will punish you
For your selfish acts

There's nothing left for you
There's nothing you can change
The cold sound of your voice is killing me
I can't forget this disappointment
Bitch!

This is your last chance
Here comes the pain.

As I stand with a knife in the rain
My head is screaming for blood
And I smile when I hear this shot

The voice woke me up
But I guess I shouldn't listen

Can you hear this voice?
It's fucking killing me

My hands are shaking in the dusk

I can't control my dreams
You can look away, but you can't turn a deaf ear
This voice in my head
I'm afraid to follow the words
Please give me a sign

The voice is growing bigger
And I guess I can't do this shot

And then I pull the trigger
And I think I've done this.

Please forgive me

But by and by it destroys my inner force
The first thing in my head when I wake up
Save my heart
You are the last thing in my head when I fall in sleep
You could destroy it
All I want is just the truth to trust

My heart dies by suffering

I'm afraid to fall again

I look into your eyes
And try to see behind the walls
The walls of silence

My heart in your hands
I hate the past
You could destroy it
But all I need is the truth
Is just the truth
You could break me into pieces with one fuckin' lie

Save my heart

So save my fuckin' heart

Can you hear me or are you deaf and dumb?!
Feel you nothing when I stamp it on your face?!

You waste your poor life

Blind by hate, slaved by fear

Shaded by dreadful crimes
Greed and selfish plans
Sometimes it's hard to distinguish
Between day and night

Can you feel the blame
Where is the resistance!?
That will be the last chance
You know that

You act without human sanity
You make things unforgiveable
With your fuckin selfish plans
Regardless of the consequences

You're a pain in the neck
I think a bullet is the only way

Tell me I'm your friend but you're wasting your breath

I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is
Every hated love
I have broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now (are you running away?)
I come apart (as I lie awake)
It's in my blood (let the sky fall down)
I won't let go (my oblivion)

Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is
Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to harm
Nothing left to live

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now (are you running away?)
I come apart (as I lie awake)
It's in my blood (let the sky fall down)
I won't let go (my oblivion)

Face the monster I've become
(And fight! I will not become!)

Hope will guide you to the end
And there will be no last goodbye

All will fade before your eyes, as we turn the tide
I will bring the dream to life, hold on, just hold on
I will keep you here inside, just close your eyes

Take the rebel from within
Now I know that I'll survive
Show me how the lame pretend
As I watch this world collide
Fate will guide you to the end
And there will be no hope to hide

For all who live and die, leave it all behind

Take away the dark inside, and lead me to the light

Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, and shed my skin

I can see the devil closing in
I choke the breath that dies to cry for help
I feel the pull of gravity
I bleed no more, and rise again
I've lost it all

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, and shed my skin

It is no longer a human, it's a beast
Unmerciful, ferocious, fearless
You're a madman
Tampering with nature

Carry me through this world alive

Bury me in this cold light

Lies are spoken
When the venom crawls inside
Faith is broken
When the fire fills our eyes
Love lies hopeless
When the hate becomes the high
Pain is chosen
When the devil comes alive

(Daylight falls)

So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive

Rain is closing
When you're caught between the lines
Faith is forfeit
When the hollow fills our eyes
Hate lies hopeless
When the heart and soul divide
Pain is worthless
When the shadow comes alive

(Daylight falls)

So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive

So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive

Name  Save Yourself
Artist  Breaking Benjamin
Album  Ember
It must have been inside my head
I've lost the hope that I have left
And now, at last, it comes to pass
We sleep, we dream, we have no less

Along the path we lost our way
It's all a game that I must play
And now the weak that fall
Return to ash, defeated after all

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

Let go, when all has come to life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost in time
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie
The fall of humankind
The everlasting light

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

Let go, when all has come to life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost in time
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie
The fall of humankind
The everlasting light

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

(Let go)
Save this selfish world
Save this selfish world
Save this selfish world
Save this selfish world

Is this the way it's gotta be?
Ignite the fire inside of me
Embrace the life of tragedy
A tide of war and broken dreams

I am torn in two...
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through...
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this world for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

Is this the fate we fall between?
Deface the life inside of me
Drain the heart with atrophy
And take away the remedy

I am torn in two...
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through...
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this world for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life!

(Please hold on...)
I am torn in two...
Hold on, hold on, we're barely alive
I am faded through...
Hold on, hold on, the fallen arise
I will fight this world for you
And let the dawn of love survive
Broken, I crawl back to life

Hold on
Rise!
Hold on
Rise!
Hold on
Rise!
Hold on

Take this blood!

I will make you
I will starve the pain within
I will crave you
I will learn to hate again
I will drain you
I will make you whole again
I will blame you
I will lay beside the dead

Cause I don't want to live inside this hell

Tame the fire from within
You won't break me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

I won't save you
I won't starve the hope within
I won't change you
I won't fight the pain within
I won't fail you
I won't let your light descend
I won't play you
I won't face your fate again

Cause I am born to live inside this hell

Tame the fire from within
You won't break me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Tame the fire from within
You won't take me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Let the calm rise up
So graceful
Every wasted word
So faithful

Tame the fire from within
You won't break me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Tame the fire from within
You won't take me
Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

Suffocate me
Suffocate me

I see nothing in your eyes
And the more I see the less I like
Is it over yet, in my head?

I know nothing of your kind
And I won't reveal your evil mind
Is it over yet? I can't wait

So sacrifice yourself and let me have what's left
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way, get away, please

You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

This will be all over soon
(This will be all over soon)
Pour the salt into the open wound
Is it over yet? Let me in

So sacrifice yourself and let me have what's left
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way, get away, please

You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

I'm waiting, I'm praying
Realize, start hating

You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

Here I stand, helpless and left for dead

Close your eyes, so many days gone by
Easy to find what's wrong, harder to find what's right

I believe in you, I can show you that
I can see right through all your empty lies
I won't stay long in this world so wrong

Say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the devil tonight

Trembling, crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold dead eyes stealing the life of mine

I believe in you, I can show you that
I can see right through all your empty lies
I won't last long in this world so wrong

Say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the devil tonight

Hold on, hold on

Say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the devil tonight

Hold on, hold on

Hiding betrayal
Driving the nail
Hoping to find a savior

Milk it for all it's worth, make sure you get there first
The apple of your eye, the rotten core inside
We are all prisoners; things couldn't get much worse
I've had it up to here, you know your end is near

You had to have it all, well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard, you will get what you deserve
When all is said and done, I will be the one
To leave you in your misery and hate what you've become

Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life
You should've learned by now; I'll burn this whole world down
I need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind
You think you've won this fight; you've only lost your mind

You had to have it all, well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard, you will get what you deserve
When all is said and done, I will be the one
To leave you in your misery and hate what you've become

Hold me down (I will live again)
Pull me out (I will break it in)
Hold me down (Better in the end)
Hold me down

You had to have it all, well have you had enough?
You greedy little bastard, you will get what you deserve
When all is said and done, I will be the one
To leave you in your misery and hate what you've become

Sing it for me
I can't erase the stupid things I say
You're better than me
I struggle just to find a better way

So here we are
Fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye
The lonely road
The one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye

You wouldn't like me
Keep moving on until forever ends
Don't try to fight me
The beauty queen has lost her crown again

So here we are
Fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye
The lonely road
The one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye

Goodbye

So why are you so eager to betray?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up
So why are you the one that runs away?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up

So here we are
Fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye
The lonely road
The one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye

If I had to I would put myself
Right beside you, so let me ask
Would you like that, would you like that?
And I don't mind if you say this love
Is the last time, so now I'll ask
Do you like that, do you like that?

No

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Try to find out what makes you tick
As I lie down sore and sick
Do you like that, do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind, just let me say
That I like that, I like that

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Desperate, I will crawl, waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone; what have I become?

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane

Borderline, dead inside, I don't mind falling to pieces
Count me in, violent, let's begin feeding the sickness
How do I simplify? Dislocate, the enemy's on the way

Show me what it's like to dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight

Full of fear, ever clear, I'll be here fighting forever
Curious, venomous, you'll find me climbing to heaven
Never mind, turn back time, you'll be fine; I will get left behind

Show me what it's like to dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight
Holding on too tight, breathe the breath of life
So I can leave this world behind

It only hurts just once
They're only broken bones
Hide the hate inside

Show me what it's like to dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight
Holding on too tight, breathe the breath of life
So I can leave this world behind

I'm done with these endeavors
Alone I walk the winding way
(Here I stay)

It's over
No longer
I feel it growing stronger
I live to die another day
Until I fade away

Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough, it never is
But I will go on until the END!

Surround me
It's easy
To fall apart completely
I feel you creeping up again
(In my head)

It's over
No longer
I feel it growing colder
I knew this day would come to end
So let this life begin

Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough, it never is
But I will go on until the end

I've lost my way
I've lost my way
But I will go on until the end

Living is
Hard enough
Without you fucking up

Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough, it never is
But I will go on until the end

I've lost my way

My hands are broken
And time is going on and on it goes, forever (How long)

So I got high and lived all that life
That I have taken all for granted

Promise me you'll try to leave it all behind
'Cause I've elected hell
Lying to myself
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life

You,
You.

The only way out
Is letting your guard down
And never die forgotten (I Know)
Forgive me my love
I stand here all alone and I can see the bottom

Promise me you'll try to leave it all behind
'Cause I've elected hell
Lying to myself
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life

You fight me
Flat on my lonely face I fell
Finding in the end I live well
In the light of the life that I have found
It's coming down
I don't know what isn't real
But it's easy to beat me
Suck it in
Life is sink or swim
Love is blinding
No surviving
I don't know what I want to be yet
But I can show that I need to see this
No time for lies and empty fights
I'm on your side

Can't we live a life of peace and happiness?
I don't think so
No denying that I'm scared to lose the things I love
I'm in control

This is how
This is how it's gonna end
This is how
This is how it's gonna end
End

Everyone is waiting here
For everyone
Leave me alone

Only God could save you if you knew your way to the light

So fly away and leave it behind
Just stay awake, there's no where to hide

I hear you cause you won't quit screamin my name
I feel you cause you won't stop touchin my skin
I need you-- coming to take you away

I could lose it all but I cannot recall, It's all wrong
Don't you cry-- Clear away this hate and we can start to make it alright

So fly away and leave it behind

Shut up, smart little bitch, I don't need lies
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
Get up, force it to fit
Confined inside

Don't pull me under into the deep
I often wonder how it should be
I'm picking sides and pulling the strings
I'm living lies and shedding the skin
I'm open wide and letting you in

Drank up all my alcohol,

But I caught your lie, and you know I did
Now I'm lost in you, like I always do
And I'd die to win, cause I'm born to lose

Firefly, could you shine your light?
Now I love your ways, 'cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified as I fall in line
And it's hard to try when you're open wide

Take my hand, we'll be off, and then
We'll come back again to a different land
Now I like this way, you can go away
If you guess the name you cannot replace

Firefly, could you shine your light?
Now I love your ways, 'cause they're just like mine
Now I'm justified as I fall in line
And it's hard to try when you're open wide

Bring me your enemies
Lay them before me
And walk away
Walk away

Never mind, I'll let it happen to you
Out of mind, forget it; there's nothing to lose
But my mind and all the things I wanted

Every time I get it, I throw it away
It's a sign, I get it, I wanna stay
By the time I lose it, I'm not afraid
I'm alive, but I can Surely fake it

How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me?
You're the part of me that I don't wanna see

Forget it

There's a place I see you follow me
Just a taste of all that might come to be
I'm alone, but holding breath you can breathe
To question every answer counted

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way

Forget it

It's a crime you let it happen to me
Out of mind, I love it, easy to please
Never mind, forget it, just memories
On a page inside a spiral notebook

Just fade away

I live a chemical life
I'm on a mission to try
You went insane for the day
I'll have to show it away

My only option is gone
Smile as they break and they fall
You want a simpler life
You can't erase what was mine

You must be out of your mind
This was a simple design
You fuck it up every time
How could you leave me behind?

It's all right, it's all right
'Cause I know what you want
But you'll just have to wait
If I had it to give
I would give it away
I'm living it up
While I'm falling from grace
There's no way, there's no way
That I'm running away

I'm used to making it worse
Made up of four-letter words
You want know what it was
Now isolated and gone
You fall apart at the seams
I'll never know what it means
Try not to pull it apart
You're aiming straight for the heart

You must be out of your mind
This was a simple design
You fuck it up every time
How could you leave me behind?

I don't know what to say, so let me be
And now I find
You've left me behind
I don't know what to say, so never mind

You're mine

'Cause I know what you want
But you'll just have to wait
If I had it to give
I would give it away
I'm living it up
While I'm falling from grace
There's no way, there's no way
That I'm running away
There's no way, there's no way
That I'm running away
There's no way, there's no way
That I'm running away

Crowded streets are cleared away
One by one
Hollow heroes separate
As they run

You're so cold, keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while strong men die

Show me how it ends; it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfy an empty inside
Well, that's all right
Let's give this another try

If you find your family
Don't you cry
In this land of make-believe
Dead and dry

You're so cold, but you feel alive
Lay your hands on me one last time

Show me how it ends; it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfy an empty inside
Well, that's all right
Let's give this another try

Show me how it ends; it's all right

I want a normal life
Just like a newborn child
I am a lover hater
I am an instigator
You are an oversight
Don't try to compromise
I'll learn to love to hate it
I am not integrated

Just call my name
You'll be okay
Your scream is burning through my veins

Sooner or later
You're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw your life away
Driving me under
Leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw your life away

You're like an infantile
I knew it all the while
You sit and try to play me
Just like you see on TV
I am an oversight
Just like a parasite
Why am I so pathetic?
I know you won't forget it

Just call my name
You'll be okay
Your scream is burning through my veins

Sooner or later
You're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw my life away
Driving me under
Leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw my life away

Sooner or later
You're gonna hate it
Go ahead and throw our life away
Driving me under
Leaving me out there
Go ahead and throw our life away

Oooooo throw our life away
Oooooo throw our life away

Coal Black Hair, baby blue eyes
You wouldn't know the devil
If she came in disguise
Sittin' in the corner
With a wicked grin
She'll take the soul of a man
Just because it's a sin

Don't trust a woman

Long black dress and a Coup De Ville
She'll get you in the back, man
Just to give you a thrill
But there's a little price to pay
She didn't tell you about
Well if you get in that car man
You ain't getting out

Don't trust a woman

Soul of a woman

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
Make love to her once
And there's no turnin' back

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

She plays it so cool
That she's hard to resist
She's like a tall smooth drink
With a poison twist
She'll wrap all around you
Like a rattlesnake
And squeeze the life outta you
Just to watch you heart break

Don't trust a woman

Soul of a woman

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
Make love to her once
And there's no turnin' back

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

When the deal is closed
Awaiting anxiously
He's just another victim
Struggling mercilessly
She loves the conquest
And she loves the fight
She's comin' back for more
In the thrill of the night

Don't trust a woman

Soul of a woman

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
Make love to her once
And there's no turnin' back

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

Don't trust a woman in a black Cadillac
She got the soul of the devil inside

Some people like to live
Where the livin' is good
Other people just like to live
Down in Hollywood
Some people say live and let live
On the edge of town
But don't nobody try to
Hold me down

We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
And if you get anymore
You might wish that you hadn't

Some people try to tell me
What I should be doin'
Spent all my money
My whole life screwin'
Well they can have it all
If that's what life means to them
I won't even care if it happens again

We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
And if you get anymore
You might wish that you hadn't

Well everybody in this fucked up town
Thinks that makin' money
Makes the World go 'round
Get off the phone
And open your eyes
You would see your own life
Just passin' you by

Nobody wants to talk about it
I guess that's true
But you'll know, yes you will
When your time is through
Saint Peter didn't put you here
For no reason at all
So when it's time to go
Oh brother stand tall

We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
And if you get anymore
You might wish that you hadn't

We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
And if you get anymore
You might wish that you hadn't

I've lost the plot again
Tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made
And my soul's a sorry state
So come on down you empty lovers
(Worms come out of the woodwork)
And the snakes start to sing

Do you feel the chill (Clawing at the back of your neck?)
I start to spill (Did you really think that you could fix me?)
They'll sell your bones for another roll
(Well sharpen your teeth) Tell yourself that it's just business

Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
I fall apart and the snakes start to sing

Don't say I'm better off dead
'Cause heaven's full and hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Oh well, you could lock me up in your heart
And throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?

I'm just a would've been, could've been, should've been
Never was and never ever will be
Well sharpen your teeth (Tell yourself that it's just business)
Would've been, could've been, should've been
Never was and never ever will be
(Worms come out of the woodwork)
And the snakes start to sing

Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
I fall apart and the snakes start to sing

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still gettin' high?
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife my mother held
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still gettin' by?
Was I your knight in shining armor
The apple of your eye
Or just a step to climb?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still gettin' high?
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife our mother held
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still gettin' by?
Was I your knight in shining armor
Or the apple of your eye
Or just a step, a fucking step, to climb?

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything

The world is a shit tip, your children are fucked
The ones you think guard you are out for your blood
Well our minds are battered and washed out with static
But what exactly do you think you're gonna do?

United we'll fail, divided we'll fall
We're fucked but you're makin' it worse
United we'll fail, divided we'll fall
Give up 'cause you're makin' it so much worse

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything

Oh, give me a break you deluded, ill-informed, self-serving pricks
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your screens and onto the streets

There will be no peaceful revolution; no war without blood
You can say I'm just a fool that stands for nothing
Well to that, I say you're a cunt (Cunt, cunt, cunt)

Kick it

United we'll fail (United we'll fail)
Divided we'll fall (Divided we'll fall)

United we'll fail
We're fucked but you're makin' it worse

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck

Believe in no one

Hallelujah, well I'm saved
Just a dozen steps and twenty-eight days
It's a miracle, I'll be born again
With the Lord as my shepherd I will find a way

Fuck your faith
No one's gonna save you
Fuck your faith

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No, death can't touch the crooked young
There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No, death can't touch the crooked young

The crooked young

We don't sleep, we don't eat
We speak in tongues
We can't die, we're dead inside
No, death can't touch the crooked young

Believe in no one but yourself
The faceless won't save you
The clouds won't hear your fuckin' prayers

(There's no hope for us)

Eyes like a car crash
I know I shouldn't look but I can't turn away
Body like a whiplash
Salt my wounds but I can't heal the way I feel about you

I watch you like a hawk
I watch you like I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
Will the hunger ever stop?
Can we simply starve this sin?

That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

And on my deathbed, all I'll see is you
The life may leave my lungs
But my heart will stay with you

That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

(The waves will pull us under)
Tides will bring me back to you
(The waves will pull us under)
Tides will bring me back to you

It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
And we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing

The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live while we learn and then we forget
We'll never find our way back home, come on

They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane

(The wolves are at my door)

It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing

I hear them clawing at the gates (Let us in, let us in)
I hear them calling out my name (I don't care)

Let them sing, let them sing, let them sing
Let them bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let them bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let them bastards sing
Let them godforsaken bastards sing

They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane

The wolves are at my door
But I can't see the writin' on the walls
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall

It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing!

For the love of God, will you bite your tongue
Before we make you swallow it?
It's moments like this where silence is golden
(Golden, golden, golden...)

And then you speak

No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company

When did the diamonds leave your bones?

I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

No one wants to hear you (Save your breath)
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
You think that no one sees this?
I think it's time you knew the truth, yeah

I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

When did the diamonds leave your bones?
Leave your bones

You're not a shepherd, you're just a sheep
A combined effort of everyone you meet
You're all flesh, with no bone
Feed them to the sharks and throw them to the wolves

I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break

"And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside of me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
It's always there when you come back down
The funny thing is, all I ever wanted, I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends that I have, the music I make
The love that I feel, I just had to start again"

The days are a death wish
A witch-hunt for an exit
I am powerless

The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless

Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless

Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
I can fear death no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell

Throw me to the flames, watch me burn
Set my world ablaze, watch me burn

"How are we on a scale of one to ten?"
"Could you tell me what you see?"
"Do you wanna talk about it?"
"How does that make you feel?"
"Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?"
"Have you've been skipping meals?"
"We're gonna try something new today"
"How does that make you feel?"

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me (Burn)
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me (Burn)
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me (Burn)

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me (Burn)

Well, join the club, yeah, join the club
Or know what the fuck it'd take to feel that you fit in?

The same old thing over that nobody knows
My heart is a dead horse, there's no point in beating
Just let me sink, let me sink into the fucking ground

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drownin' in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes

What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to say

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drownin' in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

There's nothing in the air tonight

There's nothing in the air tonight

And I've seen it all before

I'm sorry love, it's not enough
We should feel the love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know these cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But fuck this love, it's not enough

It's not enough

My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smotherin' me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here, do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim or simply disappear?

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smotherin' me
Help me find a way to breathe

Seeing as time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

Wake up, take my hand and
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up, pull me out and
Give me a reason to start again

Time stands still (Time stands still)

A solitary fuck about your goddamn beliefs
I'm going blind but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll feel

Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick

What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
The bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your King when He shows Himself

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

Show me Your face, show me a reason to think
My soul can be saved if I sell You my sins
I'm going blind but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me

Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

You said you want me, now I'm here
Now I'm here, now I'm here
You said you want me, now I'm here
Now I'm here, now I'm here

Ever since it began
I was blessed with a curse

I was better off for worse
I was born into a hearse

I know I sang my heart beats for you
I was lying girl
It beats for two

Cause I've got your love
And I've got these voices

Take back!
Every word I've said ever said to you
Take back!
Every word I've said ever said to you

Ever since it began
I was blessed with a curse

And for better or for worse
I was born into a hearse

I know I said my heart beats for you
I was lying girl
I've been lying to you

Everything I touch turns to stone (turns to stone)
So when you are around me
Just leave me on my own

Everything I touch turns to stone (turns to stone)
So when you are around me
Just leave me on my own

Take back!
Every word I've said ever said to you
Take back!
Every word I've said ever said to you
Take back!
Every word I've said ever said to you
Take back!
Every word I've said

Because..
Everything I've said turn to stone (turns to stone)
So when you are around me
Just leave me on my own

Take back
Every word I've said ever said to you
Take back
Every word I've said every word I've said
Take back
Every word I've said ever said to you

Take back
Every word I've said ever said to you
Take back
Every word I've said every word I've said
Take back
Every word I've said ever said to you

Name  Blessed With A Curse
Artist  Bring Me The Horizon
Album  There is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There is a Heaven Let's Keep it a Secret
I was raised in the valley
There were shadows and death
Got out alive but with scars I can't forget

This kid back at school
Subdued and shy
An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes.

I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die
took a boy to the forest, slaughtered him with a scythe.

Stamped on his face, an impression in the dirt.
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?

We all have our horrors and our demons to fight.
But how can I win, when I'm paralyzed?

They crawl up on my bed, wrap their fingers round my throat.
Is this what I get for the choices that I made?

God forgive me for all my sins
God forgive me for everything
God forgive me for all my sins
God forgive me
God forgive me

Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Don't go
No I can't do this on my own

Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight.

Don't go
Don't go

If I let you in
You'll just want out
If I tell you the truth
You'll vie for a lie
If I spilt my guts
it would make a mess we can't clean up.

If you follow me
you will only get lost.
If you try to get closer
We'll only lose touch
But you already know too much
And you're not going anywhere

Tell me that you need me cause I love you so much
Tell me that you love me cause I need you so much
Tell me that you need me cause I love you so much
Say you'll never leave me cause I need you so much

Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Don't go
No I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones
that haunt me in the night.
I get scared so stay with me tonight

Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Don't go
Save me from the worst
And hold me in the night.
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go

(Let's go)

I've had enough
There's a voice in my head
Says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, I'll be alright

You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got
And it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, you'll be just fine 'cause

Every now and again we get the feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, going 'round in circles

(S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit, let's hear it)
(S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit, let's hear it)

We are possessed
We're all fucked in the head
Alone and depressed
But if we sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, maybe we'll forget 'cause

Every now and again we get the feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, going 'round in circles

Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel and
I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's just sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay

(Let's go)

So sing along, let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well don't you feel so much better?

(S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit, let's hear it)
Well that's the spirit
(S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit, let's hear it)
Yeah, that's the spirit

Remember the moment you left me alone
And broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean lost in the open
Nothing could take the pain away

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

The sticks and the stones that you used to throw
Have built me an empire so don't even try
To cry me a river 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg

Diese Vorstadt war noch nie Rom
Alle Wege führen vor die Wand
Möchte doch auf deinem Rücken trauern
Das Streichholz in der Hand
Ich komm mir ganz schön Scheisse vor
Wie ich hier um Ausgang bettel
Ich wollte doch Geschichte schreiben
Nicht den verdammten Einkaufszettel

Go
See me go
Go
See me go
Das wird ein harter Weg raus...

Im Büro ein Romeo
Heisse Bilder an der Wand
Allein am Abend hängt die Libido
In Fetzen an der Hand
Sei schlau, nimm die Medikamente
Strick dir eine schöne Schlaufe
Der Stock im Arsch wird nie zum Rückrad
Halte Händchen und die Schnauze

Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg

Das wird ein harter Weg raus...

Siehst dich um nach der Gnade Gottes
Und wo der Jacobsweg anfängt
Die Kapillaren sind geweitet
Der Freiraum eingeengt
Denn die Einen kommen nie nach Hause
Beständig sitze ich und warte
Ich geh mal Zigaretten holen
Setze alles auf eine Karte
Diese Vorstadt wird niemals Rom
Wenn ich zum Abschied alles regle
Grüße aus dem Nirgendwo
Setz die Zeichen und die Segel

Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg
Go
See me go
Viel zu viel, was mir gefällt
Go
See me go
Wenig hier, was mich noch hält
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg (Go -see me go)
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg (Go -see me go)
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg (Go -see me go)
Das wird ein, das wird ein... harter Weg (Go -see me go)

Sie bringen die Koffer und auf ihrem Weg
Verlieren sie Inhalt und Identität
Ich hatte ein Boot und ich hatte ein Haus
Ich hatte Sonne, alles was ich brauch'
Doch sie hatten Bomben und sie machten uns Angst
Von dem, was ich hatte, blieb nur der Rauch

Ihr tropft wie Tinte in die Hemden rein
Mir fehlt einfach nur der Schlaf

Und ich brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn'
Und ich brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn'

Was ich von Herzen liebe, interessiert mich nicht mehr
Zu viele Köche, zu viel Brei
Was ehemals Luft und Liebe waren
Sind heute Rauch und Fickerei

Und ich brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn'

Ich dreh mich noch einmal gegen die Wand
Morgen eventuell, vielleicht ein andermal
Sowas von leer und ausgebrannt

Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha
Hauptsache ist doch, dass es weitergeht - Wo es hingeht
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht, das weiß ich nicht

Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht ich lass' mich gehen
Am Tor der Stadt einen Ausweg gesehen
Dann irgendwas vom Leben und Liebe lallen
Und wie Straßenkatzen auf die Füße fallen
Solang die Flügel tragen, säg' ich am Ast
Die Augen sagen "außer Schlaf nichts verpasst"
Der Kompass fehlt, mein Norden rotiert
Wenn die Zukunft ihre Schrecken verliert
Wo es hingeht

Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha
Hauptsache ist doch, dass es weitergeht - Wo es hingeht
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht, das weiß ich nicht

Realistisch kann man sagen, wir schlagen auf
Und ferner noch: Wir gehen irgendwann drauf
Schlagen wo auf und sind irgendwo dran
Wir gehen drauf und kommen irgendwo an
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht, das weiß ich nicht
Wo es hingeht

Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha
Hauptsache ist doch, dass es weitergeht - Wo es hingeht
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht, das weiß ich nicht

Die Landkarten geschwärzt
Die Route kenn' ich nicht
Bloß in Bewegung bleiben
Ich folg' dem grünen Licht
Ich folg' dem grünen Licht

Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht, das weiß ich nicht
Wo es hingeht

Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha
Wo es hingeht, weiß ich nicht - Ha, ha, ha

So wie ein Schlag in dein Gesicht
Kam die Nachricht bei dir an
Alles wird sich ändern
Dir wird Scheiße widerfahren
Keine Schulter mehr, die tröstet
Das alte Leben explodiert
Viel beschissener ist schwierig
Wenn man den anderen Mensch verliert

Die ist wie Liebe, die man nicht hat
Wie nicht zu Hause, wie nicht dein Platz
Wir legen Asche über die Stadt
Wenn niemand mehr wartet - Zurück in Schwarz

Du beginnst, dich zu arrangieren
Schwarze Messen an den Tresen deiner Stadt
Diese Pentagramm aus Wodka
Brennt wie das, was man nicht hat
Du bist lange nicht gebrochen
Ein kleiner Knacks, ein kleiner Riss
Du leuchtest sechs, sechs, sechs mal heller
Wenn alles um dich dunkel ist

Die ist wie Liebe, die man nicht hat
Wie nicht zu Hause, wie nicht dein Platz
Wir legen Asche über die Stadt
Wenn es niemand erwartet - Zurück in Schwarz

Du siehst die rote Tür
Ich mal' sie schwarz
Du siehst die Zukunft
Ich sehe schwarz
Bitte sorg' dich nicht
Ich bin am Start
Anders als vorher, doch
Zurück in Schwarz
Du drehst die Uhr zurück,
Ich dreh' das Kreuz
Du gehst die Wege ab,
Du lachst in Moll
Legst dich in Asche,
Beschwörst die Stadt
Wenn es niemand erwartet,
Zurück in Schwarz, Schwarz, Schwarz

Die ist wie Liebe, die man nicht hat
Wie nicht zu Hause, wie nicht dein Platz
Wir legen Asche über die Stadt
Wenn es niemand erwartet - Zurück in Schwarz

Wo bleibt die Erlösung? Kalte Nächte, endloses Warten
Was ist mit Absolution, wenn es Nacht wird im Volksgarten?

Manche Dinge die passieren einfach so, so ist das eben
Gutes geht und besseres kommt ja und das Beste traf mein Leben
Als Sohn von Wut und Liebe, der die Fahne in den Himmel blies
Kurz nachdem Elvis das Gebäude für immer verließ
So kam das, was mich trug, wie eine Mauer vor mir stand
Wie meine Gang stets hinter mir, yeah und wie die Sätze an der Wand

Diese Lieder war'n mein Start, diese Straßen mein Beginn
Was zu mir passt entscheide ich und du gehörst hier hin
Diese Lieder war'n mein Start, sie sind das woran ich glaub'
Und der Rest, und was bleibt, Asche zu Asche und Staub zu Staub

Ich ging drin auf und unter, ich brauche das, bitte glaube mir
Mein Kumpel kam zum Tennis, die Würfel fielen und ich mach das hier
Das, was du mir gabst, hab ich stets versucht dir zu geben
Sieh mich an, sieh die Narben, du bist echt, du bist mein Leben

Diese Lieder war'n mein Start, diese Straßen mein Beginn
Was zu mir passt entscheide ich und du gehörst hier hin

Now baby you gon' get a crook in your neck looking at me sideways
I play high stakes made crook in a crime wave
Must be something on my face
Yelling that they ought no tell em what they spellin on MySpace dot com
Bold type face rhetoric
You gon' clickety click and get your head split
What the hell you look like on a message board
Discussing whether or not the brother is hard core
I ain't got to prove to any of you
That anything I ever said was is the truth but I'm ready to do it
And do it leisurely, Ant give 10 beats a week
So fuck it I'll put the record how it needs to be
I understand I ain't perfect alright
I been a thugged out nerd all my life
Thank God I ain't got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night
I feed people with the verses I write
And I fill them with my personal strife
Had some of y'all concerned for my life
For what I've had the nerve to recite
I cut my grass grow, bring the serpants to light
Now baby you ain't never heard me I'm tight
And I'm surgical like, with this bitch Jake
You know that shit fuck around and get a closed casket and I'm old fashioned
Trying to figure out how we got from Whipper Whip to this silly bullshit
It's just so tragic
But it ain't impossible to solve
I ain't learned jack shit from Dorian at all
Let me hear you abusing the culture I adore
I'll come across the hall and get involved like this here

I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault
And they love the way I talk
Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault

Tabernacle my hand, expand to the size of a big black granite statue
Divide it by the lightning speed that they can move
It ain't an autograph, do that math I'm a smack you
I like to pull up my pants and lean back too
Organic vegetables, mix em with fast food
I'm Howard Stern meets Howard Zinn
How could you not find a pal in him and get attracted too
I take it back for you when possible
If your hear this then I'm confiding in you
Pop call me, "Ali what's bothering you
Don't you want to tell your friends you and your father are cool"
"NO." You got more X's than the Honorable Elijah Muhammed do
But that ain't my problem with you
Truth is your just an impossible dude
You get hostile with fools when their honest with you
I could make me a snide little comment or two
But I don't see what that nonsense would prove
I don't give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes
I just do what the Qu'ran says to do and respect him
Now I ain't even here to get clandestine
But best believe I'm a get what's destined
Be it an Escalade or a fixed up F10
It's better than this bus, best friend believe that
I ain't got a free minute to lean back
Spiderman 2 coming out and Faheem need that
Plus I wanna teach him how to read on a Leap Pad
Shining bright, smiling like "look at me dad! "
That's the shit that I'm in to I defend to the death
That I'm every bit as gangster as them fools
If I wasn't G I wouldn't flow like this
If you were really a G you wouldn't know I exist, you bitch
(I don't understand what they're sayin'
But little did they know they could get a smack for that, man)
So I'd advise you to shut the fuck up
Silly muhfucka

I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault
And they love the way I talk
Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault

I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
'Cause the beat make you clap your hands
I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
'Cause the beat make you clap your hands

I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
'Cause the beat make you clap your hands
I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
'Cause the beat make you clap your hands

Would she hold me if she knew my shame?

There's always somethin' different goin' wrong

There's always someone fuckin' hangin' on
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me

He's not setting out to hurt people
He's got a lot of love in him
For you know
For his mum, his brother, his girlfriend
He actually, I think, wants to do the right thing
So it's more a question of
Will power, self discipline and circumstances

From being in love
Dark angel, fall from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my heart, from being in love
And after all of the love for you, in my life
But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes

And after all of the love for you, in my life

Album  Untrue
A New World Order to decide the chaos,
To daze our minds and to keep us blind

We're blinded and we followed without rhyme or reason
A government charade - the highest form of treason
We need to burst these Chains of oppression
We need to rise and walk the path of liberation

Right here, right now - light up the freedom flame
Tonight - this is our time
Ignite the fire in your hearts tonight
Right here, right now - wake up and make a change
Tonight - this is our time
Ignite the fire in your hearts tonight

Create a new chaos - and get in motion
With no retreat and no surrender

We need to converage and set the streets on fire
We need to bring down this corrupted empire
Smoke is everywhere - >>freedom

As I lay here - reflecting my life
I'm all alone, after all I've said and done.

Do you remember - all the times you cried in vain?
Do you remember - all the times I let you down?
Do you remember - all the times I could not ease the pain?
Do you remember - all the times I let you down?

I don't see me being a good man, no one is here to say goodbye
I wish I could go back to my broken past
I'm a broken man with nothing left
I know you can't forgive - I wish you could forget!

Do you remember - all the moments that I missed?
Do you remember - all the times I could be loved and kissed?
Do you remember - all treasures I threw away?
Do you remember - when I fled and should have stayed?

I don't see me being a good man, no one is here to say goodbye
I wish I could go back to my broken past
I'm a broken man with nothing left
I know you can't forgive - I wish you could forget!

So here I am at the end of the road,
I walk alone and nobody gives a fuck!!! FUCK!!!

I wish I could go back to my broken past
I'm a broken man with nothing left
I know you can't forgive - I wish you could forget!

Father - forgive me - for I have sinned
I am - the walking dead - it's the end
Walk with me - epiphany

Fuck you! You let me down!
I am ghost - I am the walking dead!

I'm floating in a lifeless haze
My memories are slipping away

I don't - believe in God - anymore
My sky - is falling down - darkness falls
Walk with me - in agony

Fuck you! You let me down!
I am ghost - I am the walking dead!

I'm floating in a lifeless haze
My memories are slipping away
I'm floating away...

I am the dark of the night,
The light of the day and everything in between
I'm nothing - I'm different - Where do I belong?
Why do I hate myself so much - Why can't I be strong?
I'm a misfit - Won't fit this - and nobody cares
I'm a stranger to myself - I find it hard to hear
Would you realize when I disappear?
I'm invisible like Neptune's tears!!!

No storm will take our breath and blow us away
The earth will shake with every word that we say
When worlds collide - we will always stay!!!

There's a stranger inside of me,
So deep inside of me - he will no longer be
I was no one - an empty shell,
A seeker - searching for myself
There is a reason - I am the way I am
I am who I am - I am rebellion!
I'm too different to be a part of you,
But not in different to change the world!

No storm will take our breath and blow us away
The earth will shake with every word that we say
When worlds collide - we will always stay!!!

Bow down and hail to the king!
I don't care what people think
Bow down with the face in the mud
I'm larger than life, I don't give a fuck

The throne is mine,
The crown fits fine
I couldn't care less about your crying
My rug is red,
Golden my bed
I have everything but regrets

Nothing to hold on
King of kingdom gone
I'm all alone

Bow down and hail to the king!
I don't give a fuck about anything!

I live among gods, I dine in hell
I'm on top of the world and I never fail
But within my towering walls
I sing a song about an empty soul

Nothing to hold on
King of kingdom gone
I'm all alone

Where I walk
There's light
Where I speak
There's quiet
Darkness inside
Silence cries
Is this what I long to be!?

Who have I become?
A king of kingdom gone
I'm trying to hold on

Nothing to hold on
King of kingdom gone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone

Das ist die Realität - sie frisst mich auf

Traumwelt zerfällt - wo bist Du jetzt?
Du bist gegangen ohne zurück zu schauen
Kein Wort - kein Blick
Alles versinkt im Nichts - ich folge ins Licht

An solchen Tagen
Seh ich zu wie der Regen mein Leben benetzt
Ich versinke
An solchen Tagen
Zieh'n die Wolken schwarze Fragen

Das ist die Realität - sie frisst mich auf

Schwarze Fragen die mich plagen - ein Leben lang
Ich muss hier raus - doch der Himmel schreit,
Du bist mein in Ewigkeit!

Das ist die Realität - sie frisst mich auf
An solchen Tagen
Seh' ich zu wie der Regen mein Leben benetzt

Ich versinke im Nichts ... im Nichts ... im Nichts
Und ich spüre wie der Regen fällt!

We're looking back on many years,
Lucky days and little tears
We made mistakes and had some fights,
Blackend days and lonely nights!
But we grow closer, the older we get
Whatever we do - we have no regrets

We are far from being perfect, but this is who we are
We will walk this way together, with our hearts right to the stars

Can you feel my heart!?

We're looking forward to many years,
Different cares and different fears
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll walk with you
The mistakes we made - we won't make twice
I tould you then, I tell you now - I will never let you down

We are far from being perfect, but this is who we are
We will walk this way together, with our hearts right to the stars

Can you feel my heartbeat? - Can you see my heart bleed?

I wanna thank you - for being strong
I wanna thank you - for guiding me home
I wanna thank you - for being bright
I will always hold you - I won't ever leave you behind

We are far from being perfect, but this is who we are
We will walk this way together, with our hearts right to the stars

This is it - the apocalypse
We're ruled by wolves and rats
This is it - the end of everything

Is this the end? I saw my blood - I closed my eyes
I woke up and realized
This is the end! Pitch black - dark red

And even when I feel alone,
Every stage feels like I'm coming home

A tribute to the faithful, you were always true!
A tribute to all kindred souls - here's to you!

This is your song - this is our song
We're coming home - where we belong
This is your song - this is our song

You're motivation, you're gold
Four words from a thousand lips,

We are blind to the
Worlds within us,
Waiting to be born
I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth

The face of all your fears
All of your dreams unleashed
The face of all your fears

Born of the demon sky
Twisting reality
Sweet nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
Nauseating pain
Is death the only release?

The face of all your fears
All of your dreams unleashed
The face of all your fears
I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Suicidal diseases
The face of all your fears
Now covered with scars
Humanity exiled
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth

The face of all your fears
All of your dreams unleashed
The face of all your fears

Changing channels, watching the drama
Sit and fade while losing your karma
Day by day they feed your brain
Lay your thoughts in hidden dreams
Those who watch, or those who serve
I guess we get what we deserve

Spineless and faceless
Go fuck yourself
Don't ask why
Heartless and brainless
Go fuck yourself
You know why
Pointless and senseless
Go fuck yourself
Don't ask why
Aimless and faithless
Go fuck yourself
You know why

It's killing me
This war in my head
It's killing me
We can't break free
It's killing me
This war in my head
We can't break free

Consume the light, consume the lie
Forget the wold, forget your life
I cast a spell on you and everybody else
Who doesn't give a shit for someone else
The world around you is an ugly place
You're not gonna die with a smile on your face

Illness and sickness
Go fuck yourself
Dullness and darkness
Go fuck yourself

The virus is out and there is no escape
A silent killer is on his way
The virus is out to choke your brain
A silent killer is after you
It's all in vain (it's all in vain)

It's killing me
This war in my head
It's killing me
We can't break free
It's killing me
This war in my head
We can't break free

I'm not going down that road again
You will drown by yourself again
In your ocean of made up lies
Rising water slowly shuts your eyes

The waves are coming in
They're washing you away
They're leading you astray
I can be your anchor no more

I'm not going down that road again
You will drown in the crimson rain
A flooded soul, a cold embrace
Davy Jones's locker till the end of days

The waves are coming in
They're washing you away
They're leading you astray

The waves are coming in
They're washing you away
They're leading you astray

I'm so sorry
Cause I'm not sorry
I'm so sorry

The waves are coming in
They're washing you away

Heart for heart
Woke up in this dream
An ugly world unseen
Unleash the beast in me
Taking a walk on elm street
I sing you a lullaby
In which your fears come to life
A good place to die
No chance to survive

Eye for an eye
A feast of sacrifice
I'm the shadow, I am the light
No place to run, no place to hide
Blood pours from the sky
We're dancing in the rain
Pandemonium, a symphony in pain

I am your demise
I am your demise
I am your demise
I am your demise
You're my sacrifice
You're my sacrifice
You're my sacrifice
You're my sacrifice

I am the shadow, I am the light
You're my sacrifice
I am the shadow, I am the light
I'm your demise

Who I am?
I am you!

Those who enter here
Will forever disappear
In the darkest night
I whispered in your ear
You will be mine
Cause it's high time
Carnage
Chaos
Endless pain
Will drive you insane

I am nemesis
I give you death
Now you belong to me
Die in agony
Greetings from hell
These are my dying words
Every time I kill
I hope to end this curse

I am the shadow, I am the light
You're my sacrifice
I am the shadow, I am the light
I'm your demise

Killing you is killing me
Killing you is killing me
Killing you is killing me
Killing you is killing me

Am I awake or still asleep?
Don't wake me up, don't make this real
Am I awake or still asleep?
Don't wake me up, don't make this
Don't make this real

(So much) hatred inside - so close to ignite.
But what you hate is a reflection.
A reflection of the love denied.
And what you love is denial.
Denial (that) makes this love a lie.
Afraid to escape - to break your fate.
Open this gate
before it's too late.

Take a look in the mirror.
What you see is a broken smile.
Caught in a world of false believes in a prison - where all hope will die.

To honor the long gone

My heaven has gone wrong

Those times we had so long ago
Like yesterday, I miss 'em so much
I can't let go

My heart is full of hate
It's bleeding love

I have to say goodbye
To keep my self alive

I can still see you
You're fading away but
I can still feel you
though you're drifting away from me (away from me)

Are you still here, still in this place?
What's left behind, where is god's grace?

Welcome to war

Everybody knows you and everybody told you
That nobody needs you and nobody cares
Everybody
Is at war with their fingers on the board
What's real and in your head
You release your poison to the world
This is the modern plague

Welcome to war
You can't escape

If this is real, I'd rather go blind
Than have this world pulled over my eyes
Cause in the end, it's all in my mind
And you're the one who's left behind

Everybody knows you and everybody told you
That nobody needs you and nobody cares
Everybody
Is caught in a world of make believe
Get a life - this is not real
We allow ourselves to be deceived
A virus, no one could heal

Welcome to war
You can't escape

If this is real, I'd rather go blind
Than have this world pulled over my eyes
Cause in the end, it's all in my mind
And you're the one who's left behind

Write down a story I'd rather forget
Won't mend the heart that's shattered and shred
Lord knows we tried, lord knows we failed
Mistrustful feelings slowly prevailed

We fade and fade from kiss to kiss
With everything that lovely is
We've both grown cold from fight to fight
Until our love has died

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday
Or should I finally bid farewell

Never give all the heart for love
No effort's ever good enough
Highs result in lowest lows,
We disavow 'til it clearly shows

A bad hand dealt, too blind with trust
Gave you my all, till all was lost
There ain't no rose without a thorn
Our love could grow and be reborn
And when you walk away
Then walk away my dear
But when you turn around
I wont be standing here

No tomorrow
No tomorrow

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday
Or should I finally bid farewell

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday
Or should I finally bid farewell

No love
No tomorrow
No tomorrow (No tomorrow)

Corporate cunts and pencil pushers
Prostitute your mind for cash
This way of live, it made me suffer
Trade your given time for trash

You all work jobs you badly hate
To keep the bills at pay
For shit you bought, but you don't need
What self-deceptive way

Right from the cradle
Straight to the grave
They want to tell us
How to behave
Right from the cradle
Straight to the end
They want to force us to pretend

An open letter to you all
Your greed will take it's toll
We're with our backs against the wall
But it's only built to fall

You tell me dreams are made to fail,
Like there is no escape
Prepared to walk
The longest trail
Away from mental rape.
Intimidate me with your lies
I'm paying any price
And when I come to say goodbye,
Can't look me in the eye

Right from the cradle
Straight to the grave
They want to tell us
How to behave
Right from the cradle
Straight to the end
They want to force us to pretend

An open letter to you all
Your greed will take it's toll
We're with our backs against the wall
But it's only built to fall

But I chose not to live like that
I'm fighting my way back!

An Open letter to you all
An Open letter to you all
Your greed will take it's toll
An Open letter to you all
It's only built to fall

An Open letter to you all
Your greed will take it's toll
We're with our backs against the wall
But it's only built to fall
Built to fall

Lässt dich hart zu Boden gehen

The bogeyman is waiting
In the shadows of your dreams
You're afraid to fall asleep
You're awake 'til you're too weak
Come sweetie come it's bogey time,
let me in and you'll be mine

This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You'll never know (know)

That's accusing you
My scars don't even begin to show

Your soul is broken
And can never be mend (never be mend)
You are trapped in a silent cage
Come sweetie, come

Come sweetie come it's bogey time,
Let me in and you'll be mine
Run sweetie run, cry and fade,
This will be your last serenade
Run, cry, fight, die

This pain

You'll never know (know)

My scars don't even begin to show

Remember the time I burned all bridges to you,
It still breaks my heart in two
How can I gain your trust again?
How can I make you believe again?

My heart beats just for you
I'll never let you go
Take this oath
I love you
My heart beats just for you
I'll never let you go
Take this oath
Everything is just for you

Which words are strong enough
To make us rise from the ashes
Forgiven is not forgotten
I want to be with you for now and forever,
But forever is not even quite enough

Be my haven, be my anchor
Be my guiding light and lead us home
My heart is close to burst
My horizon is on fire
And the sky turns from blue to grey
Take my heart and save my soul

My heart beats just for you
I'll never let you go

You've gotta be fucking kidding me (kidding me)
We are, we are one voice - one heart!
We are, we are one voice - one heart!

You sound like a broken record,
Different words for the same old lies
You know we'll be the ones who suffer,
You gain power while we pay the price
Every time you open your mouth,
You spread a disease
You try to make us voiceless,
You try to make us believe

We are the many,
Like drops of water,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we're crushing
We are the many,
Like a plague of locusts,
Alone we are nothing,

In the darkest days
You promise the sun
Like the savior of a world in debris?

Now I'm standing here alone at the end of the road,
Screaming into the emptiness.
Why did we start this way together.
(Although) it was clear to me I would end up all alone,
(completely) broken and misused by love!?

I rape myself and I don't know why,
This whole thing makes no sense at all!

Have you ever understood me,
Have you ever felt the same,
Have you ever looked in my eyes,
Burt my starving heart.

I rape myself and I don't know why,
This whole thing makes no sense at all!

My heart was a present, but you didn't understand.
You weren't ready to go until the end together (beside me)
That is why I'm standing here all alone.
Screaming into the emptiness

I rape myself and I don't know why,
This whole thing makes no sense at all!

In our world fire burns brightly,
Take care or you get hurt,
Flames kiss you goodnight,
In our world you cry.
Ashes is what's left behind,
You're dead in my head,
In our world you cry

We've gone too far now,
We fell too deep,
It's our burden to bleed!

We - kill you all!
Kill you all!
We - kill you all!
Kill you!

We've gone too far,
We fell to deep,
Didn't you see?
It's our burden to bleed.
Our life was just a lie,
Our way just pain what happened,
What's left behind?

We've gone too far now,
We fell too deep,

Moment of clarity
I am willing to suffer,
To bleed-to die for the things i care about
But it's like kissing the lips of my dead love-
Like touching her dead cold white skin

Ref:
I choose to look back-
To see myself
I never wanted to hurt you again
I choose to look back-
To see myself
I never wanted to loose you again

I have been here before,ground zero
The past is a gaping hole

My only chance is to turn around and face it
I choose to look back to see myself-
For her love
For her heart
For her trust
For her love i'm reborn...;

I saved my last breath to blow this darkness away,
Sweet shadows are calling me
My heart feels free to beat,

You are the one who could save me!

Save me, you were the avenger,
A shining illusion of my lust,
A shining illusion of my trust!

Sweet shadows are calling me,
my heart is scared to beat,
It's all about my fiction beauty,
You are the one who could kill me.

Every step I make is wrong, it's like a (fuckin) nightmare and there are no more 2nd chances!!

Certainty of emptiness, trustful,
New pain and thoughts of the path
There is just one constant: Nothing is forever!
Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,
Black and white deceives,
Uncovers the glance for my grief,
Nothing is forever!

I gave my heart,
My blood,
Nothing is forever (but eternity).

Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,
Black an d white deceives,
Uncovers the glance for my grief,
Nothing is forever!
And in the end only haze remains,
Nothing is forever.

I gave my heart,
my blood,
nothing is forever (but eternity).

Certainty of fate,
Fatal emptiness,
An empty hope for future,
How shapeless fate shows,
I fight for something eternal,
Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,
Black and white deceives uncovers the glance for my grief.
Nothing is forever!!

Where is my will and drive to be happy?
You are giving me hope,
But everything seems to be illusion and smoke
For love
For life
For surrender!

Just one word and I will be yours
Just one word and I'll burn again

Just one word for a new time
Cause in your eyes
I see my self,
I'm sick of running away

But in your eyes what do I mean?
A name, one among of thousend others?
Nasty and sweet are my thoughts
But my desire can't be satisfied
For love (for love)
For life (for life)
For surrender! (for surrender)

The worst shall be over now,
Your mental beautyness was stunning,
My feeling for myself
Is overgrown of dried plants
And I am sick
And I am sick
And I am sick

And I am sick of running away!

But now you're getting it all back
And my reasons are just trivial
Try to run away
But believe me

To die this is your fate

A love letter just for you,
Let's make it right
Let's make it clear
No one wants you here

All I want is to kill
I want you dead
The price is too high
My life's too short
I'm sick of hunting you
You are my shadow
You are my demon
You have to burn for my joy
I'll watch you burn
So you better run
Before I'll watch you burn
Try to run away
But believe me
To die is your fate

Your life is life, mine is just a lie
Your life is life, mine is just a lie

Time passes by, everything flows
In the same stream
And we are driving down the river,
I pause and let you go,
My tears whip the river,
There I stand stiff forever,
Singing this song of mourning

My cradle is full of hope
I don't give up,
I break the wall (and fight)
my cradle is full of hope
I don't give up,
I break the wall (and fight)

You're going your own way,
Floating in another dream,
You feel no fear, no doubt,
Your power keeps real
There will be new paths,
No doubt and well fed fears,
We will go our ways alone,
Together alone, let's go

Your life is life, mine is just a lie
Your life is life, mine is just a lie

Seid ihr bereit
Für dieses Lied
Ein Lied, das euch von Feuer singt
Und euch den Atem nimmt

Es schmilzt ein Stab in dunkler Nacht
Deutschland hat sich hingerafft
Statt denken nur die blanke Gier
Beißt es um sich wie ein krankes Tier
Im Weltall Müll
Auf Erden Müll
Im Inneren Chaos
Uneinigkeit
Kein Recht
Und keine Freiheit

Unter dem Adler gibt es keinen Feuersturm
Das ist die Lobbyisten-Fantasie
Unter dem Adler gibt es keinen Feuersturm
Seid ihr bereit
Verliert nie die Hoffnung, denn sie stirbt zuletzt
Atlantis muss untergehen

Der alte Hass, der gleiche Neid
Die kranke Lust, die nackte Schuld
Wie immer sitzen sie in der ersten Reihe
Ein Scheusal das von Liebe singt
Ein Toter der nach Atem ringt
Ein Hohn der jeden Preis gewinnt
Zeigt mir dass das Leben stinkt
Lieber frei und bettelarm
Als ein Teil von euch zu sein

Unter dem Adler gibt es keinen Feuersturm
Das ist die Lobbyisten-Fantasie
Unter dem Adler gibt es keinen Feuersturm
Seid ihr bereit
Verliert nie die Hoffnung, denn sie stirbt zuletzt
Atlantis muss untergehen

Ja ich bin sehr unzufrieden
Weil all die Geier um uns fliegen
Sie laben sich an unserem Fleisch
Und schenken uns ein Knochenkleid
Das Fernsehen ist der Todesbote
Träume brechen die Verbote
Atlantis muss untergehen

Unter dem Adler gibt es keinen Feuersturm
Das ist die Lobbyisten-Fantasie
Unter dem Adler gibt es keinen Feuersturm
Seid ihr bereit
Unter dem Adler gibt es keinen Feuersturm
Seid ihr bereit
Verliert nie die Hoffnung, denn sie stirbt zuletzt

Bevor du gehst
Schau mir noch einmal in meine Augen
Bevor du gehst
Sag "Es soll für immer sein"
NEIN!

Alles stürzt auf mich herab
Die Uhren, sie fließen rückwärts im Strom

Wer will schon im gestern leben
Wenn das heute faulig riecht?
Verliebt, verloren, alles gleich
Zu vergessen ist nicht leicht

Was mir bleibt sind leere Bilder
Und die Schatten an der Wand
Nichts was bleibt, außer Lügen
Doch will ich nicht alleine sein

Bevor du gehst (bevor du gehst)
Schau mir noch einmal in meine Augen
Bevor du gehst
Sag "Es soll für immer sein" (Nein!)

Wo liegt der letzte Stein
Und was ist dort vergraben?
Ich will der letzte sein
Den alte Geister plagen

Doch diese Wirklichkeit
Sie treibt ein böses Spiel
Saugt alle Träume aus
Wir fallen vor dem Ziel

Was mir bleibt sind leere Bilder
Und die Schatten an der Wand
Nichts was bleibt, außer Lügen
Doch will ich nicht alleine sein

Bevor du gehst (bevor du gehst)
Schau mir noch einmal in meine Augen

Vor Jahren bist du uns entschwunden
Wo immer du auch bist
Die Zeit heilt keine Wunden

Es ist die Ferne zu allem und jedem, die unsere Heimat zu Ödland verbrennt

Ich trink mein Glas nicht aus
Ich will nicht mehr nach Hause
Dieser Abend ist zu schön
Er darf nie zu Ende gehen
Die Vögel singen
Und die Sonne geht auf
Das letzte Lied verstummt
Und die Lichter gehen an
Ich brauche keine Melodie
Und keinen Takt
Um weiter zu tanzen in meinem Film
Das Drehbuch ist vertrackt

Ich tanze wie ein Kind im Nebel
Zufrieden weil ohne Ziel

Wo sind all die guten Jahre hin?
Ich weiß, ich hab sie weggeworfen
Sie kommen nie zurück
Der Mann im Spiegel
Der vorgibt mein Abbild zu sein
Ich will ihn nicht mehr sehen
Oh Gott, du fehlst mir so sehr
Du fehlst mir
Du fehlst mir
Du fehlst mir

Ich fehle mir

Ich dünste nur noch aus
Und will nie mehr nach Hause
Und trage mich dafür
Durch Gin-durchtränkte Nächte
Das Leben zieht vorbei
Als ob ich hier ein Fremder wär
Tanqueray spült die Angst hinfort
Der Leuchtturm strahlt schon lang nicht mehr

Ich tanze wie ein Kind im Nebel
Zufrieden weil ohne Ziel

Wo sind all die guten Jahre hin?

Ich stehe endlich auf
Habe zu viel nachgedacht
Habe zu viel Zeit verloren
Und doch nichts getan
Und dieser eine Wunsch
Der durch meine Adern fließt
Mein Leben noch zu ändern
Er blüht wieder auf

Meine Liebe ist die Sehnsucht
Denn ich werd sie nie erreichen
Meine Liebe ist die Sehnsucht
Denn ich werd sie nie erreichen

Es ist kein Nebel mehr
Eher eine Einstellung
Die wie ein Tumor in mir wächst
Die Einsicht verlässt das Versteck
Mein Leben ist kein Film
Und doch sehn ich mich nach dem Happy End
Dem Wendepunkt der mich erfüllt
Doch Blumen blühen nicht auf Zement

Meine Liebe ist die Sehnsucht
Denn ich werd sie nie erreichen
Meine Liebe ist die Sehnsucht
Denn ich werd sie nie erreichen

Egal, wie weit dieser Weg auch sein wird
Sie trägt mich bis ans Ende
Ich schau nie mehr zurück

Und wenn das Licht angeht
Sieht meine Welt ganz anders aus
Ich sehe wie sie wirklich ist
Und hoffe es bleibt ewig Nacht

Halten die Augen geschlossen, das Leuchten der Pole

Wir spüren die Kälte nicht mehr
Wir sind seit 30 Tagen wach

Wir sehen das Eis in Blöcken splittern wie Kristall
Wir werden weitergehen, noch ein Stück
Immer ein Stück weiter, jedesmal
Es ist viel zu spät um noch umzudrehen
Und wir sind am Ende
Am Ende wird es uns alles nehmen, alles nehmen!

Schneeweißblind und doch gehn wir weiter
Stück für Stück um nicht zu erfrieren
Uns bricht das Eis unter den Beinen
Wir atmen ein, wir haben nichts zu verlieren

Wir sind eingebrochen und abgetaucht
Und blieben doch nicht stehen
Wir wurden abgetrieben auf riesigen Schollen
Und fanden zurück auf den Weg
Wir waren eingeschneit und auf Ewig vergraben
Verbrannt und starrgefroren
Hier gibt es nichts außer weiß hinter weiß hinter weiß
Und weißer Reflexion

Schneeweißblind und doch gehn wir weiter
Stück für Stück um nicht zu erfrieren
Uns bricht das Eis unter den Beinen
Wir atmen ein, wir haben nichts zu verlieren
Schneeweißblind und doch gehn wir weiter
Wir atmen ein, wir haben nichts zu verlieren
Schneeweißblind und doch gehn wir weiter
Wir atmen ein, wir haben nichts zu verlieren

Alle stehn dumm rum, schreien "Nico buh mal, yeah!"
Ich zertrete deine Brille
Während du sie trägst!

Du Missgeburt,
Dir wurde mehr ins Gesicht gespritzt als Mickey Rourke
LOW KICKS
In deine Pandamaske***
Nach dem Arschfick, lass ich mir den Schwanz abhacken

Paparazzi Fotos von meinen großen Klöten
Ich steig aus der Limousine ohne Höschen
Der Messias mit der AK-47 der dich plattmacht

Für immer und ewig, auch wenn's zu Ende geht

Was bleibt seid ihr, auch wenn der Wind sich dreht
Für immer und ewig, auch wenn's zu Ende geht

Wir reisen in das Morgenrot empor aus schweren Träumen sind wir auf der Flucht
Mein Kind du liegst so schwer in deinem Sarg
Ich ziehe dich vorbei an Feldern rabenschwarz

Wir schenken euch vom Leben ein, ihr schenkt uns euer Ohr
Wir teilen uns ein Herz in weiß, vernarbt und deshalb doppelt stark
Was bleibt seid ihr, auch wenn der Wind sich dreht
Für immer und ewig, auch wenn's zu Ende geht

Wir glauben an das Gegenteil
Weil die Wahrheit uns zu oft belog
Die blaue Blume, das alte Ziel
Ich weiß du hast es auch gewollt, sonst bleibt nicht viel

Wir schenken euch vom Leben ein, ihr schenkt uns euer Ohr
Wir teilen uns ein Herz in weiß, vernarbt und deshalb doppelt stark

Ich verbrenn mein Studio, schnupfe die Asche wie Koks.
Ich erschlag meinen Goldfisch, vergrab ihn im Hof.
Ich jag meine Bude hoch, alles was ich hab lass ich los. (Uuh...)
Mein altes Leben, schmeckt wie 'n labbriger Toast.
Brat mir ein Pracht-Steak, Peter kocht jetzt feinstes Fleisch.
Bin das Update, Peter Fox 1.1.
Ich will abshaken, feiern, doch mein Teich ist zu klein.
Mir wächst ne neue Reihe Beißer wie bei dem weißen Hai.
Gewachst, gedopet, poliert, nagelneue Zähne.
Ich bin euphorisiert, und habe teure Pläne.
Ich kaufe mir Baumaschinen, Bagger und Walzen und Kräne.
Stürze mich auf Berlin, drück auf die Sirene.

Ich baue schöne Boxentürme, Bässe massieren eure Seele.
Ich bin die Abrissbirne für die d-d-d-deutsche Szene.

Hey, alles glänzt, so schön neu.
Hey, wenns dir nicht gefällt, mach neu. (Hou...)
Die Welt mit Staub bedeckt, doch ich will sehn wo's hingeht.
Steig auf den Berg aus Dreck, weil oben frischer Wind weht.
Hey, alles glänzt, so schön neu.

Ich hab meine alten Sachen satt, und lass sie in 'nem Sack verrotten.
Motte die Klamotten ein, und dann geh ich nackt shoppen.
Ich bin komplett renoviert, Bräute haben was zu glotzen.
Kerngesund, durchtrainiert, Weltmeister im Schach und Boxen.
Nur noch konkret reden, gib mir ein ja oder nein.
Schluss mit Larifari, ich lass all die alten Faxen sein.
Sollt ich je wieder kiffen, hau ich mir 'ne Axt ins Bein.
Ich will nie mehr lügen, ich will jeden Satz auch so meinen.
Mir platzt der Kopf, alles muss ich verändern.
Ich such den Knopf, treffe die mächtigen Männer.
Zwing das Land zum Glück, kaufe Banken und Sender.
Alles spielt verrückt, zitternde Schafe und Lämmer.

Ich seh besser aus als Bono, und bin 'n Mann des Volkes.
Bereit die Welt zu retten, auch wenn das vielleicht zu viel gewollt ist.

Hey, alles glänzt, so schön neu.
Hey, wenns dir nicht gefällt, mach neu. (Hou...)
Die Luft hier ist verbraucht, das Atmen fällt mir schwer.
Bye Bye ich muss hier raus, die Wände kommen näher.
Die Welt mit Staub bedeckt, doch ich will sehn wo's hingeht.
Steig auf den Berg aus Dreck, weil oben frischer Wind weht.
Hey, alles glänzt, so schön neu.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Ich schreibe einen Hit,
Die ganze Nation kennt ihn schon,
Alle singen mit,
Ganz laut im Chor, das geht ins Ohr.
Keiner kriegt davon genug,
Alle halten mich für klug,
Hoffentlich merkt keiner den Betrug.

Denn das ist alles nur geklaut,
Das ist alles gar nicht meine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut,
Doch das weiß ich nur ganz alleine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut
Und gestohlen,
Nur gezogen
Und geraubt.
Entschuldigung, das hab' ich mir erlaubt.

Ich bin tierisch reich,
Ich fahre einen Benz, der in der Sonne glänzt.
Ich hab 'n großen Teich,
Und davor ein Schloss und ein weißes Ross,
Ich bin ein großer Held,
Und ich reise um die Welt,
Ich werde immer schöner durch mein Geld.

Denn das ist alles nur geklaut,
Das ist alles gar nicht meine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut,
Doch das weiß ich nur ganz alleine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut
Und gestohlen,
Nur gezogen
Und geraubt.
Entschuldigung, das hab' ich mir erlaubt.
Entschuldigung, das hab' ich mir erlaubt.

Ich will dich gern verführ'n,
Doch bald schon merke ich:
Das wird nicht leicht für mich.
Ich geh' mit dir spazier'n
Und spreche ein Gedicht in dein Gesicht.
Ich sag, ich schrieb es nur für dich,
Und dann küsst du mich,
Denn zu meinem Glück weißt du nicht:

Denn das ist alles nur geklaut,
Das ist alles gar nicht meine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut,
Doch das weiß ich nur ganz alleine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut
Und gestohlen,
Nur gezogen
Und geraubt.
Entschuldigung, das hab' ich mir erlaubt.

Auf deinen Heiligenschein
Fall' ich auch nicht mehr rein,
Denn auch du hast, Gott sei Dank,
Garantiert noch was im Schrank.

Und das ist alles nur geklaut
Das ist alles gar nicht deine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut,
Doch das weißt du nur ganz alleine,
Das ist alles nur geklaut
Und gestohlen
Nur gezogen
Und geraubt.
Wer hat dir das erlaubt?
Wer hat dir das erlaubt?

Das Fernster öffnet sich nicht mehr
Hier drin ist's voll von dir - und leer
Und vor mir geht die letzte Kerze aus
Ich warte schon 'ne Ewigkeit
Endlich ist es jetzt soweit
und draußen ziehn die schwarzen Wolken auf

Ich muss durch den Monsun
Hinter die Welt
Ans Ende der Zeit
Bis kein Regen mehr fällt
Gegen den Sturm
Am Abgrund entlang
Und wenn ich nicht mehr kann
Denke ich daran
Irgendwann laufen wir zusammen
Durch den Monsun
Dann wird alles gut

Ein halber Mond versinkt vor mir
War der eben noch bei dir?
Und hält er wirklich was er mir verspricht?
Ich weiß, dass ich dich finden kann
hör deinen Namen im Orkan
Ich glaub noch mehr
dran glauben kann ich nicht

Ich muss durch den Monsun
Hinter die Welt
Ans Ende der Zeit
Bis kein Regen mehr fällt
Gegen den Sturm
Am Abgrund entlang
Und wenn ich nicht mehr kann
Denke ich daran
Irgendwann laufen wir zusammen
Weil uns einfach nichts mehr halten kann
Durch den Monsun

Hey...Hey...

Ich kämpf mich durch die Mächte
Hinter dieser Tür
Werde sie besiegen und dann
Führ'n sie mich zu dir
Dann wird alles gut
Dann wird alles gut
Wird alles gut
Alles gut

Ich muss durch den Monsun
Hinter die Welt
Ans Ende der Zeit
Bis kein Regen mehr fällt
Gegen den Sturm

Weil uns einfach nichts mehr halten kann

Wenn man so will,
Bist du das Ziel einer langen Reise.
Die Perfektion der besten Art und Weise,
In stillen Momenten leise,
Die Schaumkrone der Woge der Begeisterung,
Bergauf, mein Antrieb und Schwung.

Ich wollte dir nur mal eben sagen,
Dass du das Größte für mich bist,
Und sichergehen, ob du denn dasselbe für mich fühlst,
Für mich fühlst

Wenn man so will,
Bist du meine Chill-Out Area,
Meine Feiertage in jedem Jahr,
Meine Süßwarenabteilung im Supermarkt.
Die Lösung, wenn mal was hakt,
So wertvoll, dass man es sich gerne aufspart,
Und so schön, dass man nie darauf verzichten mag.

In einer Welt, in der man nur noch lebt,
Damit man täglich roboten geht,
Ist die größte Aufregung, die es noch gibt,
Das allabendliche Fernsehbild.
Jeder Mensch lebt wie ein Uhrwerk,
Wie ein Computer programmiert.
Es gibt keinen, der sich dagegen wehrt,
Nur ein paar Jugendliche sind frustriert.
Wenn am Himmel die Sonne untergeht,
Beginnt für die Droogs der Tag.
In kleinen Banden sammeln sie sich,
Gehn gemeinsam auf die Jagd.

Hey, hier kommt Alex!
Vorhang auf - für seine Horrorshow.
Hey, hier kommt Alex!
Vorhang auf - für ein kleines bisschen Horrorshow.

Auf dem Kreuzzug gegen die Ordnung
Und die scheinbar heile Welt
Zelebrieren sie die Zerstörung,
Gewalt und Brutalität.
Erst wenn sie ihre Opfer leiden sehn,
Spüren sie Befriedigung.
Es gibt nichts mehr, was sie jetzt aufhält
In ihrer gnadenlosen Wut.

Hey, hier kommt Alex!
Vorhang auf - für seine Horrorshow.
Hey, hier kommt Alex!
Vorhang auf - für ein kleines bisschen Horrorshow.

Zwanzig gegen einen
Bis das Blut zum Vorschein kommt.
Ob mit Stöcken oder Steinen,
Irgendwann platzt jeder Kopf.
Das nächste Opfer ist schon dran,
Wenn ihr den lieben Gott noch fragt:
"Warum hast Du nichts getan,
Nichts getan?"

Hey, hier kommt Alex!
Vorhang auf - für seine Horrorshow.
Hey, hier kommt Alex!

Auf die Schnelle, auf die Schnelle
Machst hier ne riesen Welle
Eingebildet, arrogant
Findest Dich auch noch interessant
Denkst so wie Du bist ist keiner
Denn der BMW ist deiner
Alles dreht sich nur um dich
Alles andre siehst Du nicht

So schön, so schön, vor dem Spiegel zu stehn
Du denkst, Du bist was ganz Besonderes,
jede würde mit Dir gehn
So hip, so geil, der Allercoolste auf der Welt
Und Du ziehst ne Riesenshow ab
nur für uns mit deinem Geld

Ich find' Dich scheiße
So richtig scheiße
Ich find' Dich scheiße
So richtig scheiße

Rote Lippen - aber grelle
2 Pfund Schminke - Dauerwelle
Eingehüllt in deinem Duft verpestest Du die ganze Luft
Jeden Tag nur Sonnenbank,
Du hast Dir schon dein Hirn verbrannt
Doch wer braun sein will muss leiden
Es lässt sich leider nicht vermeiden
Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand
Wer ist die Schönste, Klügste,
Beste hier im ganzen Land
Es ist so schwer Dich zu beschreiben
und die Wörter zu vermeiden
Die ich hier nicht sagen will,
denn was zuviel ist, ist zuviel!

Ich find' Dich scheiße
So richtig scheiße
Ich find' Dich scheiße
So richtig scheiße

Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
"Ich bin wirklich obercool"
das hör ich von Dir jedesmal
Ich kann den Schwachsinn nicht mehr hören,
Du willst doch nur dazu gehören
Es hat doch alles keinen Sinn,
denn dadurch bist auch nicht in
Sei doch einfach wie Du bist
Denn ich glaub Dir deine blöden Sprüche wirklich nicht
Willst Du mich für dumm verkaufen mach so weiter,
Werd nicht laufen
Aber was erzähl ich Dir,
Du bist ja eh das Coolste hier

Ich find' Dich scheiße
So richtig scheiße

Gründlich durchgecheckt,
Steht sie da, und
Wartet auf den Start.
Alles klar.
Experten streiten sich
Um ein paar Daten.
Die Crew hat dann noch
Ein paar Fragen, doch
Der Countdown läuft.

Effektivität
Bestimmt das Handeln.
Man verlässt sich blind
Auf den Andern.
Jeder weiß genau,
Was von ihm abhängt.
Jeder ist im Stress,
Doch Major Tom
Macht einen Scherz.
Dann hebt er ab und:

Völlig losgelöst
Von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff
Völlig schwerelos.

Die Erdanziehungskraft
Ist überwunden.
Alles läuft perfekt,
Schon seit Stunden:
Wissenschaftliche
Experimente.
"Doch was nützen die
Am Ende" denkt
Sich Major Tom.

Im Kontrollzentrum,
Da wird man panisch.
Der Kurs der Kapsel, der
Stimmt ja gar nicht.
"Hallo, Major Tom,
Können Sie hören?
Wollen Sie das Projekt
Denn so zerstören?" Doch --
Er kann nichts hören.
Er schwebt weiter ...

Völlig losgelöst
Von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff
Völlig schwerelos.

Die Erde schimmert blau.
Sein letzter Funk kommt:
"Grüßt mir meine Frau."
Und er verstummt ...

Unten trauern noch
Die Egoisten,
Major Tom denkt sich
"Wenn die wüssten,
Mich führt hier ein Licht
Durch das All.
Das kennt ihr noch nicht.
Ich komme bald;
Mir wird kalt ...

Völlig losgelöst
Von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff
Völlig schwerelos ...

Steig ein!
Ich will dir was zeigen.
Den Platz, an dem sich meine Leute 'rumtreiben:
Hohe Häuser, dicke Luft, ein paar Bäume,
Menschen auf Drogen - Hier platzen Träume.
Wir hier Im Viertel kommen klar mit diesem Leben.
Ich hab' alle meine Freunde aus dieser Gegend.
Hab doch keine Angst vor dem Typen mit dem Schlagring.
Er ist zwar ein bisschen verrückt, doch ich mag ihn.
Ich kann versteh'n, dass du dich hier nicht so wohl fühlst,
Dass du zu Hause viel lieber im Kohl wühlst.
Du sitzt lieber an 'nem gutgedeckten Tisch.
Dann merkst du schnell: Berlin is' nix für dich.
Steig ein!
Steig ein!

Du in deinem Einfamilienhaus lachst mich aus,
Weil du denkst, du hast alles, was du brauchst,
Doch Im MV scheint mir die Sonne aus'm Arsch.
In meinem Block weiss es jeder: Wir sind Stars!
Hier krieg' ich alles; ich muss hier nicht mehr weg.
Hier hab ich Drogen, Freunde und Sex.
Die Bullen könn' kommen, doch jeder weiss bescheid.
Aber keiner hat was geseh'n, also könn' sie wieder geh'n.
OK, ich muss gesteh'n: Hier ist es dreckig wie 'ne Nutte.
Doch ich weiß das wird schon wieder mit 'n bisschen Spucke.
Mein schöner weißer Plattenbau wird langsam grau.
Drauf geschissen! Ich werd auch alt und grau Im MV.

Meine Stadt, mein Bezirk, mein Viertel, meine Gegend, meine Straße, mein Zuhause, mein Block, meine Gedanken, mein Herz, mein Leben, meine Welt reicht vom ersten bis zum 16. Stock.

Der Typ aus'm Ersten war früher ma' Rausschmeißer.
Seitdem er aus'm Knast is', is' er unser Hausmeister.
Er is' oft bei der Nutte aus'm Zweiten.
Jetzt verkauft sie Fotos von ihm beim Arschausweiten.
Der Fetischist aus'm Fünften kauft sie gerne.
Er sagt "Rosetten sehen aus wie kleine Sterne."
Obwohl die von dem Schwulen aus'm Elften immer aussieht,
Als wenn man den Schwanz gerade frisch rauszieht.
Und davon sing ich dir ein Lied - du kannst es kaufen.
Wie die Sekten Fans aus dem Neunten, die immer drauf sind.
Genauso wie der Junkie aus'm Vierten,
Der zum Fruehstück erst mal zehn Bier trinkt.
Dann geht er hoch in den Siebten zum Ticker.
Er bezahlt für zehn Teile, doch statt Gras kriegt er 'nen Ficker.
Damals war der Drogenstock noch der Zehnte.
Der aus'm Siebten ist der, der überlebte.

Meine Stadt, mein Bezirk, mein Viertel, meine Gegend, meine Straße, mein Zuhause, mein Block, meine Gedanken, mein Herz, mein Leben, meine Welt reicht vom ersten bis zum 16. Stock.

Hier kriegst du alles.
I'm Zwölften bei Manne kriegst du Falschgeld
Und 'n Bootleg von Eisfeld.
Ein Stock höher hat so 'n Kerl sein Studio.
Er rappt und macht Tracks auf die Beats von Coolio.
Ganz zur Freude der Hausfrau darüber.
Die sagt: "Männer ficken auch nicht mehr wie frueher.",
Deshalb trifft man sie oft I'm 15. Stock
Bei der Hardcore-Lesbe mit dem Kopf unter ihrem Rock.
Wenn ich ficken will, fahr' ich runter in den Dritten,
Aber die Braut fick' ich nur zwischen die Titten,
Denn der Pornostock befindet sich Im Achten.
Hier könnt' ich jeden Tag woanders übernacht'n.
Im 16. Stock riecht der Flur voll streng
Aus der Wohnung, wo so 'n Kerl schon seit drei Wochen hängt.
Ich häng' I'm Sechsten rum - in meinem Stock,
Mit meinen übergeilen Nachbarn in meinem Block.

Meine Stadt, mein Bezirk, mein Viertel, meine Gegend, meine Straße, mein Zuhause, mein Block, meine Gedanken, mein Herz, mein Leben, meine Welt reicht vom ersten bis zum 16. Stock.

Du bist wirklich saudumm,
darum gehts dir gut
Hass ist deine Attitüde,
ständig kocht dein Blut
Alles muss man dir erklären,
weil du wirklich gar nichts weißt
Höchstwahrscheinlich nicht einmal, was Attitüde heißt

Deine Gewalt ist nur ein stummer Schrei nach Liebe
Deine Springerstiefel sehnen sich nach Zärtlichkeit
Du hast nie gelernt dich zu artikulieren
Und deine Eltern
hatten niemals für dich Zeit
(Ohoho) Arschloch!

Warum hast du Angst vorm Streicheln?
Was soll all der Terz?
Unterm Lorbeerkranz mit Eicheln,
weiß ich, schlägt ein Herz
Und Romantik ist für dich
nicht bloß graue Theorie
Zwischen Störkraft und den Onkelz
steht 'ne Kuschelrock-LP

Deine Gewalt ...;

Weil du Probleme hast, die keinen interessieren
Weil du Schiss vorm Schmusen hast, bist du ein Faschist
Du musst deinen Selbsthass nicht
auf andere projizieren
Damit keiner merkt,
was für ein lieber Kerl du bist

Deine Gewalt ...;

Слабонервных, беременных и детей
просим удалиться из зала,
остальным лечь на пол и задержать дыхание!

Schwule Mädchen - Sondereinheit
Schwule Mädchen - Kampfeinsatz
Schwule Mädchen - An jeder Ecke
Schwule Mädchen - In deiner Stadt

Wir sind schwule Mädchen

Wenn drei schwule Mädchen
Durch Hamburg geh'n,
Dann bleiben die Leute einen Augenblick lang ruhig steh'n
Sie seh'n uns an,
warten was passiert
bis sie wissen es ist Zeit,
dass wir zusammen durchdrehen

Auf verlegenen Wegen
In verregneten Städten
Nach vernebelten Feten
In zertretenen Beeten
An beschädigten Theken
Auf ungezählten Planeten
Im täglichen Leben
Könnt ihr schwule Mädchen begegnen

Schwule Mädchen...

Hier wir wussten, dass Not am Mann war
Schwule Mädchen Propaganda
So 'n Oberhammer
Bringt sogar Großstadtpunker durcheinander
Überzeugt mich doch vom Gegenteil
Wir zähl'n bis drei
Und da wollt ihr euch bewegen bei?
Auf jeden Fall, gut für's Seelenheil
Und ganz nebenbei geh'n wir steil
In der Nachbarschaft

Worauf warten wir noch
Es ist nie zu spät
Leute macht mal Krach

Für das Killerkommando
Das am Mikro steht
Bis der Tag erwacht

Also seit ihr dabei, wenn der Beat losgeht?
Wenn der Beat... Wenn der Beat...
Wenn der Beat... Wenn der Beat losgeht

Deine Lebenslinie fließt - vorbei
An Ufern die dich hoffen ließen
Du bist wie Treibgut
Auf endloser See!

Ist das alles?
Nein das ist es nicht! (Nein!)
Wenn die letzten Freunde gehen
Weil dein Leben schläft
Ist das alles?
Nein das ist es nicht!
Wenn die Jahre Mauern ziehn
Und dein Leben schläft

Frevel, Unmut und auch Zorn
Verkümmerten den letzten Dorn
Die letzte Kraft, mein Aufbegehr
Gegen tausend, einem Heer
Aus Lasten die nicht tragbar sind
Dein Hirn verfault (verfault)
Und treibt im Wind (wind, wind, wind...)

Ist das alles?
Nein das ist es nicht! (Nein!)

Weil dein Leben schläft

Wenn die Jahre Mauern ziehn
Und dein Leben schläft

Weiße Wüsten
Todgeliebter Träume
Tausend Meilen tief in dir
Kahle Räume

Es ist Jahre her
Kannst du dich nicht erinnern?
Dass du damals glücklich warst
Es dämmert mir...

Wer spricht? Es ist mein Spiegelbild
Wach auf, Wach auf, Wach auf!
Ich ruhe selbst, doch nicht in Frieden

Ist das alles?
Nein das ist es nicht! (Nein!)
Wenn die letzten Träume gehen
Weil dein Leben schläft

Hey, hey, hey, let's go!

Die Fahnen sind gehisst, das Feindbild längst geklärt!
Doch wo kein Krieger ist zerfällt die Gegenwehr!
Wo ist die Jugend, die dagegen rebelliert?!
Nicht ständig Pornos glotzt, zum Untergang masturbiert!?

Es ist Krieg und niemand geht hin - es ist alles verloren bevor die Schlacht beginnt!
Auf Messers Schneide ins Verderben tanzen wir im Dämmerlicht
Auf Opium im Darmkanal sehen wir die Scheiße nicht!

"Wir sind Helden!" Alles ist gelogen!
Wir sind feige, gebrochen und verzogen!
Schwarz, Rot, Gold! Über uns'ren Gräbern
Gefallen für die Apathie, in Einigkeit verscharrt.

Es ist Krieg und niemand geht hin - es ist alles verloren bevor die Schlacht beginnt!
Auf Messers Schneide ins Verderben tanzen wir im Dämmerlicht
Auf Opium im Darmkanal sehen wir die Scheiße nicht!

"Nach uns die Sintflut!" wandelt ihr als Abziehbild
Wie Wurmgetier den Staub fressend - zu Kreuze kriechend!

Ich bin sicher, dass das Gewächs in meinem Gehirn... dieses hier, dieses mein ich, genau... ich glaube nicht, dass es tatsächlich ein Tumor ist.
Kein unkontrollierter, kleiner, Blasen bildender Haufen Fleisch, sondern in Wirklichkeit ist es ein neues Organ, ein völlig neuer Teil meines Körpers.
Ich denke massive Dosen von Videodromsignalen formen sowas wie ein neues Zusatzteil im menschlichen Gehirn, dass die Halluzinationen produzieren und
kontrollieren und somit die Realität völlig verändern kann. Wahrscheinlich denken sie Wirklichkeit kann außerhalb unserer Vorstellung von Wirklichkeit

Wenn Märchen lügen und Wehmut meine Schritte lenkt
weht ein Wind aus alten Tagen
durch Wälder, die vergraben sind.

Manchmal wünschte ich - Gott, es gäbe dich!
Manchmal wünschte ich - Gott, es gäbe dich!

Sich als Sporen am Geist vergehn -
Ich will die Wahrheit von unten sehn!

"Gehet weiter in das Licht!"
Niemals! Niemals! Niemals! Niemals!

Doch das Morgenrot wirft ein and'res Licht -
auf den Abgesang, der allzu bitter klingt...
Im Todesstreifen eingemauert höre ich dein Graben nicht...
Höre ich dein Graben nicht...
Und ein letztes Mal werde ich mich selber ausgraben...
Ich hoffe es bleibt dabei...

Doch... All die Zweifel sterben nie! Niemals! Niemals!
Und ziehn die Vögel fort, schau' ich ihnen nach - und bleib' alleine hier - Ich bleib' alleine hier!
Manchmal wünschte ich - Gott, es gäbe dich!

Ich sauf'! Ich kotz'! Ich lüg'! Ich fick'!
Ich brech' mir selber das Genick!
Und dabei fühl ich mich auch noch frei!
Doch am nächsten Tag seh' ich in klarem tiefstes Schwarz.

Oh Herr, vergib' mir! Ich weiß nicht, was ich tu'!
Ich bin das Suchen leid - so viele Wege,
Im tiefen Dornenwald - wo bleibt das Ende?

Ich sauf'! Ich kotz'! Ich lüg'! Ich fick'!
Ich koste alles dreimal aus!
Wenn Gier regiert so schwor ich mir, schließ' ich ab und steige aus!
Doch der Vorsatz, ist er noch so gut...
Versinkt in meinem Glas, ertrtinkt in meinem Blut!

Oh Herr vergib' mir! Ich weiß nicht, was ich tu'!
Ich bin das Suchen leid, so viele Wege,
Im tiefen Dornenwald - wo bleibt das Ende?!

Die Seile lassen mich herab - mein neues Heim ein Eichensarg
Und vielleicht wird es mir besser geh'n wächst das Efeu immergrün

Oh Herr vergib' mir! Ich weiß nicht, was ich tu'!
Ich war des Suchens leid nach diesem Wege
Drei Ellen tiefer wo ich ihn fand'!

Kannst du nicht schlafen, obwohl du doch so müde bist?
Dann komm' mit mir und ich zeige dir den Rest der Welt!
Ohne Schatten, weil kein Licht fällt
Läuft es sich leichter durch die Welt!
In meinen Venen pures Ethanol
geteerte Lungen sagen "Lebewohl"!

Ich bin ein Kind der Nacht! Schlafes Bruder ist der Tod!
Ich bin ein Kind der Nacht! Kommt der Morgen graut es mir!
Seitdem ich mich neu erfand passt meine alte Haut nicht mehr
ein Fetzen Kleid aus bleichem Fleisch
Für etwas Neues ist jetzt Zeit!

Das ist kein Lobgesang - Es ist verzweiflung im Ausklang!
Und bist du's Leid, lass' ich dich hier! Mich zieht es weiter (Bleib' nicht hier!)
Schritt für Schritt! Stück um Stück!
Zerfällt das Leben, fern von Glück!
Das Licht es schmerzt, denn es ist falsch
wir ziehen weiter - hier ist es kalt!

Ich bin ein Kind der Nacht! Schlafes Bruder ist der Tod!
Ich bin ein Kind der Nacht! Kommt der Morgen graut es mir!
Seitdem ich mich neu erfand passt meine alte Haut nicht mehr
ein Fetzen Kleid aus bleichem Fleisch
Für etwas Neues ist jetzt Zeit!

Wenn Vögel singen, der Tag erwacht, lieg' ich geruhsam! Gute Nacht!

Und immernoch sitzen wir hier im Beerdigungscafé.
Und immernoch warten wir darauf, dass ein Sturm kommt,
der uns Erlösung bringt.
Auf unserem Kamin, tausend Urnen mit Träumen - niemals beigesetzt.
Und dabei weiß ich genau wie du, dich quälen die gleichen Geister wie mich.



Lass mich gehen! Ich will nur weg von hier.
Weit weg, weit weg von dir.
Den letzten Nagel in meinem Sarg
Bestimme Ich - Und du bist es nicht!



Ich schau dich an, ich sehe mich, doch warum seh'n wir das Ende nicht?
Obwohl wir schon am Abgrund stehen zwingen wir uns weiterzugehen.
Dies ist mein Letzter Wille, ich halt es nicht mehr aus!
Ich springe ab, sonst führt kein Weg hieraus.
Das Morgen ist zum Greifen nah, was schert es mich was gestern war?





Nein, du bist es nicht, du warst es nie.
Auferstanden aus Ruinen hat man nie für uns
geschrieben...(geschrieben...geschrieben)
Auch wenn du tiefer graben musst
Erhellt mein Scheitern deine Lust



Ich will nur weg von hier
Weit weg, weit weg von dir.
Den letzten Nagel in meinem Sarg
Bestimme Ich - Und du bist es nicht!

Ich will nur weg von hier
Weit weg, weit weg von dir.
Du bist der Nagel in meinem Sarg,
ich schaufel mir mein eigenes Grab.

Ich stelle ständig Fragen
deren Antwort ich längst weiß
warum an grauen Tagen
der Regen sauer beißt?!
Warum ich manchmal traurig bin
obwohl ich lach'
es fehlt der Sinn...

Ich weiß es nicht, wer weiß warum?!
Ich weiß es nicht, wer weiß warum?!

Ich würd' so gern nur noch einmal
die Zeiten rückwärts drehen,
noch einmal deine Nähe spürn,
und zuhörn und verstehn...

Wenn Tage kommen, gehen sie,
sie bleiben niemals stehn
Es ist als wäre gar nichts wahr,
als könnten Blinde sehn...

Ich würd so gern nur noch einmal
die Zeiten rückwärts drehen,
noch einmal deine Nähe spürn,
und zuhörn und verstehn...

Doch Zeitreisende gibt es nicht - Der Weg zeigt nur nach vorn
Am Ende, ja dort steht mein Stein - Ich würd so gerne bei dir sein!

Ich würd so gern nur noch einmal
die Zeiten rückwärts drehen,
noch einmal deine Nähe spürn,
und zuhörn und verstehn!

Tausend Meter in das Tal zum Traumfriedhof
Und noch einmal fahre ich im Sichelkreis
Die Zeit vergeht, Einsicht bleibt
Die Zeit vergeht, Einsicht bleibt

Alles, was ich berühr'
Verbrennt in kalter Eitelkeit
Mein Körper schreit
Ich halt' ihn stumm
Ertränke ihn im Selbstmitleid

Und jedes mal höre ich mich klagen:
"Wär', wär', wär' ich doch zu haus geblieben!"

Und was ich meine, sag' ich nicht, nein
Los, los, wir ziehen gleich
Haare, Knochen, Haut und Blut
Für Ewigkeit bleibt keine Zeit

Träume gehen und Hoffnung stirbt
Nein, nicht zuletzt, sie blieb nicht lang'

Weil die Bilder, die ihr niemals sehen wollt

Und laben uns am kalten Staub
Der zersetzt von Fragen ist
Uns bleiernschwer im Magen liegt

Die Lebenslust gleich Necrophilie

Wo sind die Krieger
Die hungrig sind nach mehr?

Und wir sind das Pferd
Von innen zersägen wir
Euch mit dem Schwert.

Fickt dich dein Leben, dann fick' es zurück.

Doch niemals seid ihr drauf

Die der Saat der Gewalt
Besetzt jetzt dein Haus.

Meine Lunge brennt
Auf dieser Straße ohne Wiederkehr
Meine Lunge brennt
Ich komme nicht mehr hinterher

Was werde ich hinterlassen
Wenn meine Zeit zu Ende ist
Ich kam mit leeren Händen
Und damit geh' ich auch zurück

Ich suche nicht die Dunkelheit
Das Dunkel sucht mich
Kalte Finger einer Hand
Stehlen mir das Licht
Das Dunkel sucht mich

Mit Schaufelbaggern
So groß wie Planeten
Wird meine Seele abgetragen
Ob sie da war - Keine Ahnung
Darum zu beten
hab ich aufgegeben

Meine Lunge brennt
Denn das Kreuz, das ich trage wiegt tonnenschwer
Meine Lunge brennt
Ich komme nicht mehr hinterher

Ich suche nicht die Dunkelheit
Das Dunkel sucht mich


Kalte Finger einer Hand
Stehlen mir das Licht
Bleibe ich hier
Bleibt auch der Schmerz
Fauler Zauber Dunkelherz
Das Dunkel sucht mich

Mitten im Leben
Sind wir vom Tod umgeben

Ich suche nicht die Dunkelheit

Kalte Finger einer Hand
Stehlen mir das Licht
Bleibe ich hier
Bleibt auch der Schmerz

Ich kann nicht mehr schlafen
Weil es mich nicht loslässt
Kann mich nur betäuben Damit ich vergesse
Zumindest bis zum Nächsten Morgengrauen
Zwischen Kaffee und Kippen, nein, da liegt kein Traum

Die Polkappen schmelzen
Aus Sommer wird Winter
Die Wahrheit schmeckt bitter
Doch was liegt dahinter?
Bitte bleib ein bisschen bei mir
Hier unten ist es so dunkel

Erst, wenn Disneyland brennt Werde ich wieder tanzen
Von mir aus auch in den Untergang
Denn im Stehen stirbt es sich am besten

Das kleine Leben das Großes vermag
Wurde billig erkauft und auf ewig versklavt Halte aus mein Freund, halte aus mein Freund Denn
dieser Weg ist noch so weit

So wie ein Blatt vom Baume fällt
So gehen wir von dieser Weit
Doch irgendwann wird all das Laub von der Sonne verdrängt
Und vom Winde verweht

Erst, wenn Disneyland brennt Werde ich wieder tanzen
Von mir aus auch in den Untergang
Denn im Stehen stirbt es sich am besten

Erst, wenn Disneyland brennt Werde ich wieder tanzen
Von mir aus auch in den Untergang
Denn im Stehen stirbt es sich am besten

Und fragt den Zähler nach dem Nenner

An Tagen wie diesen
Spüre ich nichts
Vor allem nicht
Diese Unendlichkeit

Mit Scherben in den Füßen
Und Stacheldraht an meiner Hand
Stolpere ich barfuß
Durch das verdreckte Sauberland

Beim Anblick jeder Tagesschau
Und meiner Seele voller Schrott
Beginne ich zu kotzen
Und suche den Boykott

Schweigen ist nichts, schreien ist Gold
Schweigen ist nichts, schreien ist Gold
Hinter den Spiegeln liegt eine andere Welt
Schmeißen wir sie ein
Bleibt ein Echo das hält

Auf einem Auge blind
Auf beiden Ohren taub
Kriecht der Dumme in die Falle
Weil er an das Gute glaubt

Und alles schmeckt so süß
Weil er nichts hinterfragt
Bestell der Weit 'nen schönen Gruß
Vom Dauerurlaub aus dem Sarg

Oh ja, ich weiß, ich bin kein Saubermann
Lag viel zu oft daneben
Bin zu oft falsch gefahren
Doch ich mache einen Cut
Denn was zu viel ist, ist zu viel
Ich reiße an der Schraube
Und sprenge mein Ventil

Schweigen ist nichts, schreien ist Gold
Schweigen ist nichts, schreien ist Gold
Hinter den Spiegeln liegt eine andere Weit
Schmeißen wir sie ein
Bleibt ein Echo das hält

Und pflanzen ihre Lügen in unsere Köpfe ein.

Hör bitte zu!
Lass mich nicht so stehn.
Ich wollte dir noch so viel sagen
Mein Kopf ist voll von Dingen
Die ich nicht alleine tragen kann
Ich frage dich:

Schaust du auch zum Himmel auf
Und siehst es nicht?
Kein Stern der die Nacht erhellt
Kennst du auch das Gefühl
Fremdkörper zu sein?
Nicht von dieser Welt.

Es zerrt, es reisst in meinem Hirn
Doch es tut mir längst nicht mehr weh,
Längst nicht mehr weh.

Ich höre dir zu,
Ich lese es in deinen Augen.
Da wohnt noch viel mehr.
Das Leben war nicht immer fair zu dir
Du hast so viel erlebt
Und vielleicht noch mehr.

Du schaust auch zum Himmel auf
Und siehst es nicht.
Kein Stern der die Nacht erhellt
Du Kennst auch das Gefühl
Fremdkörper zu sein.
Nicht von dieser Welt.

Es zerrt, es reisst in deinem Hirn
Doch es tut dir längst nicht mehr weh,
Längst nicht mehr weh, weh, weh, weh

Ich wünschte wir hätten Flügel
Um alles zu überfliegen.
Denn Weitsicht sieht von oben anders aus
Denn Weitsicht sieht von oben anders aus

Schaust du auch zum Himmel auf
Und siehst es nicht?
Kein Stern der die Nacht erhellt
Kennst du auch das Gefühl
Fremdkörper zu sein?
Nicht von dieser Welt.

Es zerrt, es reisst in meinem Hirn
Doch es tut mir längst nicht mehr weh,
Längst nicht mehr weh.

Es schreit in mir
bin weder nah noch fern
Ein Gedanke jagt den nächsten
alles will, alles will MEINE RUHE STÖRN'!
Ich bin so ausgebrannt!
ICH BIN SO AUSGEBRANNT!
Kein Feuersturm
in meiner Brust
Dort wächst alleine nur der Frust
Dort wächst alleine nur der Frust!
Wenn ich in den Spiegel schau'
starrt mich ein Zombie an
aufgedunsen, gedankenschwer
Wenn ich in den Spiegel schau'
starrt mich ein Zombie an
Meine Seele, meine Seele fault!
Metastasen auf meinem Leib
bin infiziert mit Oberflächlichkeit!
Ich bin so ausgebrannt!
ICH BIN SO AUSGEBRANNT!
Kein Feuersturm
in meiner Brust
Dort wächst alleine nur der Frust
Dort wächst alleine nur der Frust!
Wenn ich in den Spiegel schau'
starrt mich ein Zombie an
aufgedunsen, gedankenschwer
Wenn ich in den Spiegel schau'
starrt mich ein Zombie an
Meine Seele, meine Seele fault!
INFIZIERT!!!
Und ich weiß,
ich bin nicht alleine
DIES IST DIE WELT DER WANDELNDEN TOTEN!
Ein schwarzes Z auf unserer Stirn...
WIR SIND AUSGEBRANNT!
Kein Feuersturm
in jeder Brust
Dort wohnt alleine nur der Frust
Dort wohnt alleine nur der Frust
Wenn wir in den Spiegel schaun'
starren uns Zombies an
DIES IST DIE WELT DER WANDELNDEN TOTEN!
Wenn wir in die Leere schaun'
starrn' wir uns selber an!
INFIZIERT! INFIZIERT!

Ich ziehe durch die Straßen,
wieder zu viel gesoffen,
zuviel geredet, nichts gespürt!
Die Nacht ist laut und grell,
der Regen hört nicht auf,
Ich bekomme nie genug!
Bin auf der Jagd
nach dem Gefühl,
einem Puls,
der mein Herz rasen lässt!
MEIN PULS GLEICH NULL!
Noch ein Glas,
Ich denke an dich
noch ein Glas, ich vergesse mich!
Noch ein Glas,
Ich denk' nur an mich
ein letztes Glas und vergesse dich!
Bin auf der Jagd
nach dem Gefühl,
einem Puls,
der mein Herz rasen lässt!
Mein Puls gleich null
Und nichts passiert
Meine Jugend ist gestorben
Der Frühling ist vorbei!
Auf der Suche...nach einem Puls...

Und wieder ein Tag vorbei
Alles hält mich davon ab
Hier stehe ich
Und wohin will ich gehen
Ein Anfang der kein Ende kennt
Ein Anfang der kein Ende kennt

Weißt du was ich fühle
Hast du je an mich gedacht
Wo soll das alles enden
Frage ich mich jede Nacht!

Und jeder Tag verstreicht
Als wäre nichts
Getrenntes Leid für Einsamkeit
Doch...;

Ohne dich geht es nicht
Ohne dich geht es nicht

Stunden siechen Tage kriechen
Ich trage das was mich zerstört vor mir her
Und wieder liege ich neben dir
Keiner redet niemand spricht es aus

Weißt du was ich fühle
Hast du je an mich gedacht
Wo soll das alles enden
Frage ich mich jede Nacht!

Und jeder Tag verstreicht
Als wäre nichts
Getrenntes Leid für Einsamkeit
Doch...;

Ohne dich geht es nicht
Ohne dich geht es nicht

Soll es das gewesen sein
Soll es das gewesen seieiein
Soll es das gewesen SEIN!!

Und jeder Tag verstreicht
Als wäre nichts
Getrenntes Leid für Einsamkeit
Doch...;

Ohne dich geht es nicht
Ohne dich geht es nicht

Und jeder Tag verstreicht
Als wäre nichts
Getrenntes Leid für Einsamkeit

Ohne dich (ohne dich)
Ohne dich (ohne dich)

Wer hat den geilsten Groove,
den derbsten move?
Wer hat den dicksten Arm,
den längsten Schwanz?
WIR!
Du bist wirklich true,
willst uns was erzählen
so wie es richtig läuft,
ohne anzugeben
Wir seien alles Blender, randvolle Emoscheiße
Hier was zum kompensieren:
Du bist die wahre Schlampe!
Ficken, bumsen, scheiße fressen
BUKKAKE ALL NIGHT LONG!
Dieses Lied ist nur für euch,
das ist euer Lieblingssong!
Es ist uns scheißegal
Ob du dich Szene schimpfst,
ob du dich pierct oder tättowierst
Ach ja, das geht auch gar nicht,
studierst ja BWL,
kehrst Musik den Rücken,
NIEMAND WIRD DICH VERMISSEN!
Ficken, bumsen, scheiße fressen
BUKKAKE ALL NIGHT LONG!
Dieses Lied ist nur für euch,
das ist euer Lieblingssong!
Du kannst mich nicht leiden,
Ich kann dich nicht leiden!
Da sind wir schon mal zwei im Hater Verein!
Ich halt' es wie Mutter Theresa,
meine Kohle bleibt bei mir!
Ich falle morgens' aus dem Bett
Und kipp' mir Stierhormone in mein Bier!
Raus aus dem Körper,
rein in den Club!
Raus aus dem Standesamt,
rein in den Puff!
Wer hat den dicksten Arm, den längsten Schwanz?!
WIR!!
Ich lass' ihn aus der Hose hängen und mach' den Ententanz
YEAH!
Feier' mit mir oder schmeiß' dein Bier
Ist mir egal, du hast die Wahl –
Du kannst gerne kommen und den Fickfinger zeigen
Hauptsache du hast den Eintritt bezahlt!
Ich will stagediven – bitte geh' zur Seite!
Du steckst bis zum Hals, ich bis zum Sack – in der Scheiße!
KIZ und CALLEJON – BUKKAKE ALL NIGHT LONG!
Das war dein Haus, deine Mutter, deine Schwester und deine Kamera?!
OH PARDON!
Ficken, bumsen, scheiße fressen
BUKKAKE ALL NIGHT LONG!
Dieses Lied ist nur für euch,
das ist euer Lieblingssong!

Ein armes Herz
von Sturm zerfegt
Erlangt den wahren Frieden
Nur wo es nicht mehr schlägt!
Als wär' ich taub
Im Labyrinth
Stolper' ich verkatert
Die Sehnsucht macht mich blind
Ich find's nicht raus
wie es laufen soll
alles zieht vorbei
ich zerbrech' an meinem Stolz
Ich könnte kotzen!
...doch wer die Qual hat, hat die Wahl!

Wo ist mein Schöpfer,
der mir einen Namen gab?
Wo liegt die Antwort?
Ich hab' zu oft gefragt!
Will's nicht mehr wissen,
denn jetzt ist es scheißegal,
ich leb' mein Leben

Aus Katakomben kalter Kammerspiele
Erklingt ein kreischend heisrer' Ton!
Dort spielt ein Gott
Den keiner kennt
Ein Liebeslied auf seinem Trohn!
Von links nach rechts
Zieht es herab
Die Tränen sind sein Notenblatt.
-Auf Sehnen die wie Geigen klingen-
Kreisende Wellen steigen empor
DIE STIMMEN TAUSENDER IN SEINEM OHR!
Tanzt! Tanzt! Tanzt! ...
Bis eure Füße bluten und sich der Himmel purpurn färbt!
Aus Katakomben kalter Kammerspiele
Erklingt ein kreischend heisrer' Ton!
Die Flüsse trocknen
Adern versiegen
IN TOTEN VENEN FLIEßT KEIN BLUT!
...auf Sehnen die wie Geigen klingen
Spielt er im Wahn und wird weiter singen:
Tanzt! Tanzt! Tanzt! ...
Bis eure Füße bluten und sich der Himmel purpurn färbt!
"Ihr seid verdammt, bis in alle Ewigkeit
Zu tanzen auf meine Weise,
Dies war nie eure Welt!"
Tanzt! Tanzt! Tanzt! ...

Es ist so schwer
sich selbst zu begreifen,
vor allem dann
wenn man
auf etwas wartet.
Es ist so schwer
sich einzugestehen,
das jetzt jeder Tag
anders ist.

In dir fand ich
alles was ich brauchte.
Doch ich sah es nie,
ich sah es nie,
und wenn der Schnee
mein Grab bedeckt,
scheint alles fort,
doch nur versteckt.

Gestehen das jetzt
jeder Tag
anders ist.
Scheiße bleibt!

In dir fand ich
alles was ich brauchte.
Doch ich sah es nie,
ich sah es nie,
Und wenn der Schnee
mein Grab bedeckt,
scheint alles fort,
doch nur versteckt.

Es ist so schwer
Es ist so schwer

Es ist so schwer dich jetzt zu sehen,
sehen das du glücklich bist.
sehen das du glücklich bist.

Glücklich bist
Glücklich bist

Doch ich sah es nie,
ich sah es nie.
Es fällt dir schwer
beim Anblick selbst.
Scheint alles fort
doch nur versteckt.

In dir fand ich
alles was ich brauchte.
Doch ich sah es nie,
ich sah es nie,
und wenn der Schnee
mein Grab bedeckt,
scheint alles fort,
doch nur versteckt.

Wenn die Nacht die Welt verschlingt
Ein Glockenschlag vom Ende singt
Und die Sonne nie wieder scheint
Die Schwärze bleibt, sich mit uns vereint

Werden wir tanzen auf all' deren Gräbern
Die uns beneiden
Auf dass sich die Geister scheiden
Vielleicht denkst du, wir machen nur Spaß
Doch wir stehn' hier oben und du liegst im Sarg, Sarg, Sarg
Liegst im Sarg!

Wenn die Nacht die Welt verschlingt
Dein Selbstmitleid mit dir versinkt
Bis du zerfressen von deinem Hass
Ein Sturm im Wasserglas

Werden wir tanzen auf all' deren Gräbern

Vielleicht denkst du, wir machen nur Spaß

versuchst nur noch nein zu sagen
wenn es gar nicht mehr anders geht
wenn das essen nicht mehr drin bleibt
wenn das ja fuer jemand anders steht
trittst raus auf die strasse
der mond ein stroboskop
der ostwind und das eis
der schnee und dein atem
deine blase und die bar
ihr rauch und die nacht
der morgen und die strasse
ihre blicke und der bus
dein bett und ihr kissen
wieder allein, immer allein
gehst wieder an die grenzen
hier fuehlst du dich wohl
steigst zurueck unter diese decke
huellst dich wieder ein
kratzt alte schichten runter
alles muss raus - heute noch
nimmst dir so viel zeit wie ihr braucht
nachbarhaeuser leuchten gelb und blau
mit einem daumen auf der klingel
drehst du dich um und laeufst
wenn du jetzt nach vorne faellst
liegt ihr euch in den armen
zum allerersten mal seit 25 jahren
und auch damals bist du nur gerannt
in den morgen und die strasse
ihre blicke und der bus
dein bett und ihr kissen
wieder allein, immer allein,
viva allein!

Dies ist kein Abschied, denn ich war nie willkomm'
will auf und davon und nie wieder komm'.
Kein Lebewohl, will euch nicht kenn',
die Stadt muss brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn'.

Und wieder von vorn, Fuß aufs Gas, ah, in ein gutes Jahr
sofort los, sorglos, ohne groß Fokus Richtung Zukunft fahrn'.
Weg von immer nur leben ohne Riesengefahren,
jede Nacht lang, Schlaf nur Probe liegen für'n Sarg.
Werf' mein Streichholz in die Luft auf den Rest meines Lebens.
und blicke nur zurück, um eure Gebäude brennen zu sehen, im Ascheregen
Sieh nur wie die Pläne zerfallen, eh wir langsam verglühen, dann lieber gehen mit 'nem Knall, ah.

Ein drittel Heizöl, zwei drittel Benzin,
Augen und Herzen sind Dynamit (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ein drittel Heizöl, zwei drittel Benzin,
müde mit 'nem Plan und 'nem Ziel

Ich breche auf, bin raus, dreh das Radio laut, fahr zum Hügel hinauf
und lass es unter gehen (Hey), lass es unter gehen (Hey), lass es unter gehen (Hey).
Ich breche auf, bin raus, dreh das Radio laut, fahr zum Hügel hinauf
und lass es unter gehen (Hey), lass es unter gehen (Hey), lass es unter gehen (Hey).

Wieder wird das Weihwasser knapp, für die Bürger der Neinsager Stadt,
jede Rede der Prediger, ledig, ewig und eh zum Scheitern verdammt.
Wobei das Warten umsonst auf den Tag der nie kommt.
Bin im Wagen davon, los und starte von vorn, ah.
Kein Schritt zurück, nimm von hier kein bisschen mit.
Blick zu lang in den Abgrund und der Blick zurück, Hitze drückt.
Lieber neu beginn' als was das Alte verspricht.
Auf nimmer Wiedersehen und danke für nichts, danke für nichts.

Ein drittel Heizöl, zwei drittel Benzin,
Augen und Herzen sind Dynamit (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ein drittel Heizöl, zwei drittel Benzin,
müde mit 'nem Plan und 'nem Ziel

Ich breche auf, bin raus, dreh das Radio laut, fahr zum Hügel hinauf

Ich breche auf, bin raus, dreh das Radio laut, fahr zum Hügel hinauf
und tanze im Ascheregen (Hey), tanze im Ascheregen (Hey), tanze im Ascheregen (Hey).

Dies ist kein Abschied, denn ich war nie willkomm',
will auf und davon und nie wieder komm'.
Kein Lebewohl, will euch nicht kenn',
die Stadt muss brenn', brenn', brenn', brenn'.

Raus von hier, das Taube spüren
Nehm mir nie zuviel, bisschen für's Bauchgefühl
Die falschen Drogen zur richtigen Zeit
Werf 'n Schatten wo das Licht nie scheint, für kurze Zeit
Und übernehmen Straßen abends, immer Wasser bis zum Hals
Lieber Regenparka tragen
Sprachlos, tanzend statt reden
So müde von der Stadt die nie schläft, bleibt in Bewegung
Hörst du den Chor? Schief und doch schön
Höhen leicht daneben, wir sind Tiefen gewöhnt
Mit großen Augen zwischen Bahnschienen und Schrebergärten
Arm in Arm singend, über Leben die wir nie leben werden
So wie das Ding hier nunmal läuft
Kleinganoven beichten mit zwei Fingern über Kreuz
Wir sind Legenden, wir selbst
Gemeinsam vor'm Ende der Welt
Willkommen zuhaus'

Wo jeder Tag aus Warten besteht und die Zeit scheinbar nie vergeht, vergeht, vergeht
In diesem Hinterland, verdammtes Hinterland
Wo Gedanken im Wind verwehen und die Zeit scheinbar nie
Vergeht, vergeht, vergeht.
Geliebtes Hinterland, willkommen im Hinterland

Immer Steine schmeißen, Hauptsache laut
Für alles zu haben, zu kaum was zu gebrauchen
In diesen Hinterwelten getrieben von Kindergeld
Wenn Taten mehr sagen als Worte, sind die Stille selbst
Man gibt uns gut zu verstehen, die leeren Gläser der Theke sind beste Lupen aufs Leben.
Unter'm Haus der Straßenlaterne nun um elf
Gemeinsam am Ende der Welt
Willkommen zuhaus'

Wo jeder Tag aus warten besteht und die Zeit scheinbar nie vergeht, vergeht, vergeht
In diesem Hinterland, verdammtes Hinterland
Wo Gedanken im Wind verwehen und die Zeit scheinbar nie
Vergeht, vergeht, vergeht
Geliebtes Hinterland, willkommen im Hinterland

I accepted the subtle invitation in your beautiful green eyes
And pressed an ear to your ruby red lips...

"It's coming to get me", you whispered.
A button on your dress released itself
And the garment dropped to the floor.
The fussy eunoch had fumbled to cover your exposed shoulders
But you couldn't reach...

"Look...it wants to kill me!"
Understated, yet petrified...
You were appealing to my better side
Although the devil in me ached for satisfaction.

I dashed to the elevator...
Pressed the arrow and waited.

On my 13th floor balcony in this hollow hotel
I spied on the lobby below.
There's pandemonium.

Guns are trained...cops in corners.
Cops in visors...lines of shields...
And I swear I caught the eye of the beast.
Wrong.

As my would-be adversory turned from the counter, a dart flew into his forehead.
The guns rattled...the line of shields parted.
There was a distortion of spice like a ball of congealed air rolling at a massive speed...
Scattering bodies as it squeezed through the gap in the closed elevator doors.

And I turned to watch the illuminated number descend...
1...2...3...4...so slow it must grow angrier by the second...
8...9...10...
"It's coming to get me", you whispered...
But what the hell could I do about it?

I woke up.
I'm sorry.
And the radio at my bedside spat out the ever-worsening news:
Satan's in the White House!

React.
Reboot to the sound of a violent fart at a pretentious dinner party.
Let it pass.
I want to wake up again.

I couldn't save you, my lovely.
I cannot save myself.

It's coming to get me...

Could I rot, if life gave out?

See a vision

Reach at a high, altitude is on fire
Red again, read a lie
Everyone is on fires
I'm seeing it
I am seeing it

Aimed at his side
Cut across to divide
Up and down, what inside?
Hold on to a lie
You believe in it
You believe in it

Between a near
Somewhere over there
When I do try and fight
Can't recollect the evil deed
Sure wear those clothes
I'm washing out the blood I know
More tomorrow, our deafened lies
Look toward a frozen sky

The night of timeless fire is drawing near
I flee...
Throughout the years of throe
Watching through a mirror, as I fall apart
I see a wreck, I'm burning

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down I see me, I'm my own enemy

Watching myself decaying, (decaying)
falling from high spirits
I flee...
Throughout the ruins of me
Longing for finding my way out
Leaving myself, there's nothing left for me
The ruins are about to crumble down

The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies
It reflects hatred in my eyes

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down, I see my ashes scattered around my grave

Angels whispering fire, no longer I'm alive
Settled down, I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come

I can't get started from the part
Where I left off yesterday
Should have spent my time a little wiser

I sat alone, guilty of sin
Waiting for words to come,
From out of my head
Still making sense to anyone?

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides, it's not worth it to try

Get out
Get out

Lock myself up in a room
Without a window just to see
If it was any easier to breathe (I was wrong)
Never underestimate the daylight
The air is so much easier to breathe

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides, it's not worth it to try

can we last through the winter
the water's starting to freeze
the only one who remembers
taking the wrong step falling in front of me
this body's already aging
these nights are already long
and if I last through the winter I swear to you now, I wont call

congratulations, go home now

will we last through the winter
will we make it to see
I never wanted a partner
and I never loved you
now you are free to leave
this heart is already frozen
I can't remember to thaw
and if I last through the winter
I swear to you now, I won't call

congratulations, go home now

it's too late it's too late
they won't let go
I've followed five foot steps through that open door, open door
it's too late its too late
they won't let go
I've followed five foot steps through that open door, open door

it must be buried under the heart
that makes this place persistent
you'll find in time, the gate's been open and
I've been wondering, if you'd been real with us

it's too late...

it's too late it's too late
they won't let go
I've followed five foot steps through that open door, open door

Look into my eyes

Don't resist the love we feel
The pain is pleasure and it's just as real

Sweet agony

Kiss my lips and taste goodbye
Poisoned milk like a lullaby
Look into my eyes

Death is sweet life now undone

Swan boats in daisy chains
Can't seem to recall
My true given name
I see my footprints
How they come, how they go
Was that yesterday,
Or only a moment ago?

My heart has gone
I've gone cold
My heart has gone
I've gone cold

The past gives way
To a cold winter field
With ground below
Hard as steel
Beyond the hill
A distant song
But that hill
Keeps going on and on

My heart has gone
I've gone cold
My heart has gone
I've gone cold

Swan boats in daisy chains
Can't seem to recall

I see the footprints
How they come, how they go

They said the meek shall inherit the earth
Oh God, that seems like so much work
I want to sing and dream and drink and cry
And let this night pass me by

Oh, take me to the future, I'm ready
My affection is so unsteady
I can think of tomorrow
I can sleep through today
As the sun melts the ice caps away

I'll carry your cross now, baby
It's a blasphemous world today
We are the tender missionary
From the Underworld USA

It is so easy to confess
When you are guilty of nothing less
Than a crooked wretched stupid tepid
Indifference

Yea, take me to your bedroom, I'm ready
My complexion is so unsteady
I remember tomorrow, I forget yesterday
I want to move into your body and stay

I'll carry your cross now, baby
It's a blasphemous world today
We are the tender missionary
From the Underworld USA

I'll bury your pain now, baby
Are you happier now? I feel now
In the tender cemetery
Where we always are here to stay

They said the meek shall inherit the earth
Oh, I want to know what it's all worth
With a knife in my back
And a star in my eye
Oh, let this life pass me by

Can you take me to your heaven? I'm ready
I know the weight of my heart is too heavy
I will love you with all of the love that I have
Even if that means there's none left for me

I'll carry your cross now, baby
It's a blasphemous world today
We are the tender missionary
From the Underworld USA

I'll bury your pain now, baby
Are you happier now? I feel now
In the tender cemetery
Where we always are here to stay

(A cosmic kiss in the dead of night)
(A curse lifted under streetlight)
(I will love you in the future forever)
(Until my heart explodes)
(And it will)

I did this to myself
The summer air burning in my lungs
One more glance till I come undone
Let's stop this rising sun

Bright lights can see
They always shine right through me
Leaving me an open book
Of halfways and could-have-beens
Taking us to the end, end, end
And that summer changed us
It's best I admit that to myself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world

Now it's just me sucking in that summer air
What a summer, I had no care
How quick it all crashed down
Not willing to bend, bend, bend

And these struggles changed us
It's best to admit that to yourself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world

That morning came too soon
What were we suppose to do
One choice torn in two
I know what you were put through
And I thought we had it
We didn't have enough
We can't go back
We'll never go back now
THIS IS THE END

Well, I hear you're driving someone else's car now
She said you came and took your stuff away
All the poetry and the trunk you kept your life in
I knew that it would come to that someday

Like a sad hallucination
When I opened up my eyes
The train had passed the station
And you were trapped inside
Yet I never wonder where you went
I only wonder why, I wonder why

Oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh-oh-oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh, oh, Caroline (Caroline)

Well, I hear you're using someone else's number
She said she saw you in the store today
It doesn't matter whose address you're listed under
I only know they'll never make you stay

Like a memory in motion
You were only passing through
That is all you've ever known of life
That's all you'll ever do
There's a dream I have where I sail away
Looking back I wave at you, and I wave goodbye

Oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh-oh-oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh, oh, Caroline (Caroline)

In another life I see you as an angel flying high
And the hands of time will free you
You will cast your chains aside
And the dawn will come and kiss away
Every tear that's ever fallen from your eyes

You were a cheat

Playing with knives
We were cut close to home
Close to the bone
You're so alone

Something to have
Something to hold
Something to share
So I've been told

Deep in your eyes
You're one hundred years old
'Cause the years have not been
Kind to you, you know

Heal it up

Heal me up

Feeling the hole

The sense of insignificance
It winds itself around your chest.
Surrender and submission have now become what it takes to be alive.
Just keep in mind this happens to the best of us at times,
And it's not going to get any easier.
You walk this road of desolation,
Only to end up on your knees,
But just know that you are not alone.
The only things holding you back are the lies that you refuse to challenge.
You're drowning in a sea of self destruction,
And your lungs are starting to cave in.
And when you feel that your words can only be heard in echoes,
They are more deafening than ever before.
Every day we face helps build the strength that makes us who we are.
I've lived through this,
And so can you.
Suffering in silence has become something thrown to our past.
And though the friendships that we've built are constantly falling apart,
The remaining few retain the most heart.
And I'll give you my heart.

Our once-solid path is starting to diverge
And the space between us growing ever greater makes it hard for me to breathe.
But no amount of distance can change my feelings for you.
How can it be that a day I've always dreamed of,
Could also be a day that I wished would never come?
And we are slowly becoming two very different people,
But I won't give you up without a fight.
This is everything I've ever meant to say to you.
You could be thousands of miles away,
But I'll still see you when I close my eyes.
We've come too far to let our story end like this,
And we've come too far to let what we've built fall apart.
We both know this is love. I will never forget you.

We're caught in a steady decline and there's no deterrent.
Oh, the aftermath could bring you to your knees.
Guilt is starting to dissolve you from the inside out.
And you're grasping at your last chance for salvation,
And it's on its way.

This is our own world,
And its up to us to decide our own fate.
And even though change may be unavoidable,
It's up to us to emerge from the bottom of the barrel.
As a whole, we can impact mankind for the better.
And the earlier we realize this,
He sooner we can reassemble our lives, we reassemble our lives.

The best news I've ever heard was when you said you wouldn't leave
Because I know the distance would tear us apart.
And all the things you said,
Wouldn't mean a thing if you weren't here with me.
So as you turn your back to me,
I just want to let you know that I could never do this to you.
This is where our roads divide and they split in two,
And I will never see you again.
But I respect your choice.
The familiar pain sets in again,
But I can't let this drag me down.
It's things like this that made me who I am today.
It's thing like this that helped to shape/make me who I am today,
It's every hardship that I've faced.

But I just want you to know:
As everyday goes by,
I must accept that you're now living your own life.

I will not feel the sting of defeat
I've watched days become months
become years
and I've lost all faith in progression
I will never allow myself to exchange all my morals for acceptance
If this is truly where I belong
I'll fucking be here until the end of time
I've watched everyone around me jump ship
and I hope they're left to sink
The current will carry us
I am proud of all that I've become
and I'm well aware that I have steered myself in the right direction
And life is your's to destroy
I just can't respect your decision
I would rather isolate myself than be a walking definition of travesty
I watched you do away with everything
I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole
You were the catalyst for your downfall
But where the rest have failed
we are bound to succeed
And mark my fucking words
as long as we are breathing
we will overcome
The integrity that we emanate day-to-day is unparalleled
and our efforts will not go unnoticed
We will be remembered

Why do I need to justify my opinion, after all that I've seen and
done? And year after year, we give our everything to get nothing in return. The
time has come for things to change. We don't need your adoration, but we demand
your respect. I will not allow anyone the opportunity to deny half a decade of
labor. The places we've been, the faces we've seen, the months spent far from
home. This is what moves us. This is what we've grown accustom to. What we will
leave behind can not be measured in a dollar figure. There's a much deeper
meaning than that. I can't wait until the day when we've surpassed everything
that gave you a false sense of importance. I want you to question yourself. I
want you to watch you slip away. I want you to realize that your existence has
meant nothing. I hate you more than you could ever fucking know. And I hate
you for making me feel like this. I know deep down that I'm a good person, but
my patience is wearing thin. The best retaliation I can think of, would be to
let you know that for once in my life, I'm truly happy. I'm more than content
with who and where I am. Your oppression has had no effect. I don't need to
justify my opinion after everything we've been through. And year after year, we
give our everything and what we receive in return, I can't explain with words.
I'm so fucking thankful that I made it to where I am today. (I watched the

nothing more than expression. I will not lie to others, and I won't lie to

won't mind. I've never seen myself as optimistic, so this should come as no
surprise. No one feels good forever. Not even me. But this doesn't give us an

hatred into something to be proud of. We will make life worth living.

would mean nothing without your approval. But now I see the error of my ways.
All that time spent searching for myself in someone else. I think it's safe to
say that I've become everything I wanted to be. And no one can take that from
me. All of my heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself. I can't

I've never told this to anyone.
I've just tried to move past.
But lately it seems that my insecurities have got the best of me.
And I'm no longer in control.
No one should ever have to feel like this.
To feel like me.
Even though the good I have outweighs the bad,
the bad is what's leaving me with sleepless nights.
I spend most of my time arguing with my own reflection.
For no apparent reason.
And it may seem as if I have all the answers, but I'm just as lost as you.
I've spend the past few years trying to overcome my own misery,
but these sort of things take time, and I'm running out of mine.
So I will pray to a God that isn't there, to a world that doesn't hear,
to anyone who will listen,
to keep me from becoming everything I promised myself that I would never be.
I do not deserve this.

This is the only thing I have worth holding onto
I have condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages that no one will ever see
But still I fight day after day 'cause this is all I've ever wanted my life to be
And I push everything I’ve ever loved away
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking

If I find the bad in everything,
I can never be attached
I’m trying to find a balance
I’m trying to find a way
But every choice I’ve ever made brings me anywhere but home
But I’ve welcomed sacrifice with open arms
And I will never regret my decision
This is the only thing that makes me feel alive

Makes me feel alive

I’ve simply been searching for the right place to rest my head
I’m searching for common ground between all that I am and all that you need me to be
I’ve seen a future and want nothing to do with it
A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared
I’m struggling but I won’t allow myself to sink

You know where to find me
I keep my composure and assume my place, in front of those who I love most
You’re the reason why we’re here

my own heaven in the making. What do you believe in? What do you think is

But only in greedy hands, and it seems that most are still content. Where most
Are comfortable accepting insignificance, we strive to find the effort within.
If you open up your eyes, and open up your mind you will be exposed to a world as

After lie has sparked a fire in my heart, and the time has come to spread the

Of escape. We do this day after day. And I can't face the disconnect. I'll shed

This is who I am, and this is who I'll always be. I refuse to be afraid, of

The weight came and went and took my will to live.
Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what's left of me.
That's when breathing became routine, and I could feel myself fading.
Stranded.
No direction, I am a compass.
Constantly spinning.
Constantly searching for the end.
Never reaching our destination.
But the goal was never when, or where, or who...; It was only you.
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there.
You promised you'd never let me go.
But I don't know what to believe anymore.
Affection allowed me to let the light in, the fear made me whole again.
Help me rebuild my broken bones.
Help me regain my sanity.
But with caution always present, our pasts manifest themselves.
And we act as if this is what we deserve.
But I refuse to fail again.
I'd force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave.
I watched the world give up on me.
I used to spend my nights praying for air in my bloodstream, now i long to feel your breath pass through my arteries.
The goal was never when, or where, or who...; It was only you.

We ache to be transparent.
We run from the "open" arms; the facade of something greater than ourselves.
And we're left to coexist with infestation.
Our history is cursed: Through the past, present and future.
If they're created in his image, then his image is disgusting...; and even he can't wipe you clean.
How can someone see so far ahead, while they're spending every day on their knees?
Is the view from above really worth the judgement passed?
The fear, the lies, and the manipulation?
A doctrine bathed in ignorance, and written in the blood of the enslaved.
And I have never lost my faith, I just never had any to begin with.
I would sooner die for my sins, then pray for my  forgiveness.
Sew my palms together, and crucify the thoughts in my mind.
Awaiting Armageddon.
Neglecting to exercise the demons in your head.
You're "born again," but you're better off dead.
Conversion or a casualty, renounce and save yourself.
Is the view from Heaven really worth all of the judgement passed?
The pestilence that you've inflicted, and the souls of all the loved one's we've lost?
We are the sheep that rose against the shepherd, we are the ones you led astray.
Embrace the light in your heart, not the one in the sky.

Plagued by our past and we're doomed to repeat ourselves.
Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions, and circle the mind like a snare: Binding me, I'm just trying to feel something.
Cold and stale, searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted.
You wrap yourself around me, but I can only sense your presence.
You're nothing but a carcass.
I've never felt more alone than I did on those nights I spent watching you sleep.
You're the furthest thing from me, and you've been there from the start.
An empty shell, you're vacant and it scares me to death. One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris.
Fortunately, I know that I'm not worth it.
Because in my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone.
Why did I think that this time it'd be different?
I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions.
I tried by hardest but I couldn't make you feel a fucking thing.

The grave welcomes you with open arms.
Last light escapes, last breath remains.
Circling the body, brushing passed the skin and bone.
It cradles you, your holy manger.
Born into ruin, we feel withdrawal.
Death is your procreator, your predecessor.
From your decay grows a beautiful garden, The stalks caress your failure, and the petals bring you closer to eternity.
Pray for your rebirth.
Pray for your chance to bloom.
The heart starts and stops, the mind disconnects.
As flowers, we grace the earth with our presence.
The tide rises and turns, and we simply expire.

Over-saturated, our lungs fill with the essence of the universe.
Until we feel the gentle kiss of dawn draw the water from our lungs, and we can breathe easy.
Like night and day, we have never met. Aching for one another, we aim for congregation.
You are my prey, you are the martyr.
The blight takes it's toll and our bodies grow black.
Wilted, we fade away. Rotted from the root, we exchange our stem for legs.
We blossom into our bodies, and the process has been reset.

Born of two; raised by four.
I guess I took it all for granted, and only three remain.
Even though you're wounded, I know that you're still here.
I don't blame you, you just can't face the change.
We spend our golden years as living ghosts.
Caught in a constant state of purgatory.
We are only burdened by our memories until the day they cease to exist, and we follow shortly after.
Although I wonder if at any time, our minds fell upon the same plane.
I know they did, I just wish I had a chance to go back and appreciate it.
But we'll always have the winter, and the snow that got trapped behind the glass.
You may be only a shell of the man that you used to be, but I love you just the same, and I will until the day you're gone.
I just never know if I'm communicating with you or the disease.
And even though I curse the idea of an afterlife, I still hope you're taken care of.
You deserve to be at peace.
Please don't forget my face.
I won't forget to remember you.

Album  The Difference Between Hell and Home
As far back as I can remember, the failure was always there.
It was the only real companion that I have ever had.
Not meant to live like this.
Consciousness is nothing more than a vicious cycle, and I am being bled dry by my conviction.
I've spent my life trying to find my confidence, and found absolutely nothing.
Life is a lost cause.
Too weak to carry on.
I wish I'd never met who I once was.
Not meant to live like this.
Pursuing the love in all that I have lost, but I have left myself neglected, deserted from the start.
Longing for a chance to wander; a chance to chase my aspiration.
When you're devoid of feeling, you just do as your told.
Hatred is exhausting, but it's all I'll ever know.

Name  Lost

Album  The Difference Between Hell and Home
I live with the awareness of my own seclusion.
Existence fuelled by separation, A war I will not win.
Embracing only alienation.
To suffer is to abandon the only home I've ever had. Outlier.
I don't belong here.
The present state of existence acts as a refuge for the weak.
To shield our eyes is to blind mankind. Refusal to secede.
Inhabiting a world of filth which others have condemned.
We won't live our lives for them. Human hatred is my second nature.
This is the root of my isolation. I am what I am, and I am an outcast.
Don't look for me in the clouds, when I am beneath you.
Nowhere to be found.
Submerged in apathy, it's just becoming hard to care, and I am nothing.
I have grown sick of the sound of my heartbeat.
And while the whole world breathes in unison.
My lungs are my shield, to reject the world around me.
I am what I am, and I am an outcast.

Album  The Difference Between Hell and Home
If I allow the light to leave my eyes, I will never see again.
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution.
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence.
Show me the meaning of happiness.
Trapped inside this nightmare, but I haven't slept for days.
I am a slave, a slave to what I cannot see.
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out?
The quest to be clairvoyant: You are your own black hole.
How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last?
Your words like rope, tied around my throat.
Remove the earth beneath me.
Watch my spirit sink.

Album  The Difference Between Hell and Home
Tragedy is all we have in common, and at times we allow it to swallow us whole.
Drawing the marrow from our misfortunes to ignite the fire that's inside, inhale the smoke from the burn that leaves you breathless.
Breathing life into the lifeless, dragging them into the sun and exposing them as apparitions.
But is there dignity in living as an entity?
"You could have made history, and we are already forgetting about you."
Humanity is poison, and we are lost without a cure.
So stop your heart and start the healing process.
I am not fit to walk among you, but I don't want to end my life.
And just know that If I knew of any common ground, I'd leave here now, and when I got there I would build a home that I could die in.
Just to say I tried to rest in peace.
Erase me from your memory.
The ones we love will let us down, and the rats will feed off of our failure.
Eventually, this is something that we must accept.
The world moves on without us.
We leave only footprints that fade away in time.
We leave our spirits to retrace our steps.
Walk with fire, and save yourself from vagrancy.
You are your memorial, find your mark and make it.
The soil is the last thing we ingest, we watch our ashes scatter.
You are your memorial, find your mark and make it.

I am more than familiar with feeling empty.
The conduit; I allow myself to drain.
My mind is the trench in which I will be buried.
Watch me wither away.
Put me out of my misery.
I can only find solace in sleep, a sub-conscious sanctuary, I am longing to be set free.
Yet I am the one who holds the key.
I am the one who holds the key.
A lifetime spent trying to place the blame on anyone or anything.
This is not who I am.
I am not who I used to be.
Set me free!
Set me free!
Set me free!

Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my own false witness.
Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind...; and will I ever really let it come to surface?
You only see what I want you to see, and you believe all that you're told.
Serenity is a beautiful hoax.
A liar.
I have the whole world convinced of my contentment.
No truth in this.
I've lost count of all the times I made it home alive...; and wished I hadn't.
Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my phone false witness.
I'm left to conquer the mountains in my mind, and I am my maker.
Life is what's killing me.
I hate the fact that I'm just fine.
Forever seeking something to take responsibility.
Life is what's killing me.
I hate the fact that I'm alive.
Forever searching for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality.
At least I can say I tried, to cherish every single day where I woke up and didn't want to die.
I'd work my hands down to the bone trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds.
But I know I'd just be counting down the minutes until I'm miserable again.

I took a cheap shot,
A clean miss.
Burnin' my defenses by the shakin of her hips,

And then she
Moves in,
A quick kiss,
Breathing down my neck,
She had me wrapped around her wrist.

I try to
Break loose,
Tight grip,
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip.

It was a
Lost cause,
A fast fight,
She ain't taking any prisoners
And she's through playing nice.

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,
"You think you're so tough,
Baby put your hands up."

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,

She said,
"You think you're so tough,
Baby put your hands up."
Yeah.

And so I
Break off.
I gave in.
Feeling pretty good about the trouble that I'm in.

She got me
Beat down,
And bruised up.
I'm bleeding, barely breathing, but I can not get enough.

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,

Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,
"You think you're so tough,
Baby put your hands up."
Yeah.

She gets me deep in the chest,
Straight through my bullet-proof vest.
She kisses like a grenade,
Like a blade, or Bayonet.

Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in

Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known

No more holding it in
How many years can I pretend
Nothing never goes the way it should
No more sitting in this place
Hoping you might see it my way
'Cause I don't think you ever understood
That what I'm looking for are the answers
To why these questions never go away

Now I'm blaming you for everything

No more waiting for the end
Of every day that I will spend
Wishing that I only had a choice
No more pushing you away
'Cause I will be busy watching things going my way
Never looking back on this anymore
Because what I'm looking for are the answers

It's nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you're going
It's nice to know, nice to know

Sorry for these bitter words
But I'm in no mood to pretend
Why should I bother with you
When you're not even a good friend

I'm the tosser for thinking
It was anything more than it was
But you're the loser
Yes you're the loser
You think you're above god
And beyond reach
Beyond reach

It's nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you're going

Never pick a fight with someone bigger than you
That's what I learnt when I was at school
And it doesn't really matter
How clever you think you are
Those years, they leave
All kinds of scars

It's nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you're going
It's nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you're going

Carry on as you always have
And you will get
Your just reward
It may not be what you expected
But then there's nothing
You can't afford

Oh, I'm the joker for dreaming
That it could get much worse than this
But you're the loser
Yes you're the loser
You think you're above god

When you get to the bottom of the list.
In the call for sanity nothing breathes.
So I'll put you up as a friend of Mary's,
'Cause when she's raring to go she's quite contrary.

In the race for courage everyone's gone blind.

You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer, killer.

Happy in a manic sort of way
But I'm real on a manic high day
'Til the universe has left us all behind

You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer, killer.

I can't let go of the past,
When it's my future that's safe and rosy,
I can't step out onto the streets,
When it's my moods that keep me broody.

Throw it out and see what happens

That split into fractions in front of your eyes.
(In front of our eyes)

There is nothing to behold

(In front of their eyes)

You can't be sure what you're dealing with
And that's got to be good for you.

I'd die on the cross before I crossed you.
You know I'd never hurt you,
I'm just not that type of girl.

I always thought I knew what you were like,
Had no idea that we would ever fight.
As long as I could keep you in my sights,
You'd only glow and give off light.

I don't envy anything I've seen,
It's not a contest with you against me.
I only want you to let it out,
So come on baby put it about.

'Cause I need you to be,
I want you to feel free.

It's the gift that you're given,
It's the hand that you're dealt,
It's the gift that you're given,
And I'm the one to show it to you babe,
The one to show it to you babe.

How I long to take you in my arms,
And be a friend with style and charm,
I hope I make it for your sake and mine,
The way it stands there isn't the time.

'Cause I need you to be,
Want you to see me.

It's the gift that you're given,
It's the hand that you're dealt,
It's the gift that you're given,
And I'm the one to show it to you babe.

Do it to please me

Before we've had enough
Just give it one more chance

Hung up on romance

Dead by design

You're too good for me,
I don't feel worthy.
I've told you this before,
You've always known the score.

'Cause only you can give me,
The reassurance that I need.

I've told myself,
Though it don't seem to help,
Told myself,
Though it don't seem to help,

'Cause only you can show me.

Can you see me?
For the shadow that I am.
Do you believe me?
When I'm as shallow as I am.

I'm waiting patiently,
For the Polaroid to take hold.
Then all my secrets,
They will unfold.

I only wanted someone,
To lift me from despair.
When I turn a corner,
I'd like you to be waiting there.

'Cause only you can teach me,
The resources that I need.
I hold myself,
Though it don't seem to help.

With a backwards glance I said goodbye
Saw the regret in your eyes
It's too late now to change the truth
While we're living under the same roof

It's a ruse of yours
To alter perception,
Manipulate a violent situation
For your own gain

With my tits in the air
I'm strong and proud
You'll see me laughing out loud
On a crowded street
In the summer heat
We'll all be there
So come and share

It's a ruse of yours
To alter perception,
Manipulate a vital situation
To your own gain
And your own needs
And your own fear
And your own tears

Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey

In a conversation, talking of nothing
We were drinking sweet wine comforting our one and only
In our sterile business we have become jealous
Satisfied with our desolation, wrapped in our vivid dreams
Now I remember two days that mean a lot to me
I remember the two days where every hour was a day
And every minute was a lifetime and the ocean was a sea
And you dragged me into the mountains on a flimsy guarantee

The stronger the man the stronger the woman
If it ended now would you be willing?
I've given you everything
I've given you nothing

I used to think of angels but that's all gone
I used to dream of love and kisses wanting to belong
And I tear around the corners blindfolded to the world
I used to think that candyfloss was only made for girls

See how it feels for me?
Do you believe in me?

Hard-headed sense of failure in a narrow mind
I never used to think about the hurt I'd left behind
And now it falls upon me like winter snow
And I turn the same corners when there's no place left to go

The stronger the man the stronger the woman
If it ended now would you be willing?

Do you believe in me?
(This is my own private hour)
(This is my own private hour)
See how it feels for me?

Could you love me?

In this ugly room
Hangs the whisper
Of the same man

You could be my father
For the love we've shown
It's just a little too late,
It's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and always will be

Take it, I don't want it,
You can have what you like
Just don't try to trick me to sleep,
Don't turn out those lights

Now I'm sick, and always will be

Dreams of meeting truth
Be my father

He's got sugar on his lips
And he knows that the sickness is his
And he shows it
He just shows it

He'll give you the remedy
Without the chemical,
Show you the picture
Without the scenery

All he wants is
A blow by blow by blow account
Always searching for the real thing
Scratching the surface, getting nowhere

My place has been stolen,
Invaded by sharks
Covered in glitter
As shiny as glass

The pavement is soft and sweet
The galaxy is so elite

Crush me with your ice pick

And keep you down in my cave

For the last ten days
She feels as if she's sinking
In and out, in and out, in and out of phase

Che comes up for air
She thinks she's a queen
Starts telling all the choirboys
Where she's been

She dresses in black
Only for the occasion
She thinks she's a negro
But she's only caucasian

She can't tune in

She can't get off that bus

She can't grab hold

She's a mess this girl
And it's time you were told

It's like watching my own dream
This is not what it seems
So calculated
Now that's infiltrated

In the harshness of daylight
I'm frightened by sunlight
But I know those night-eyes
Will keep me from harm

Just got an ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double-barrel bong

There's water inside don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky, phunky, smelly green shit

With that flame
I light up the cherry
She's so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don't get me stirred up
The smoke, through the bubbling water
Is makin' it pure so I got ta
Take my hit and hold it

Get my four-footer and bring it on

Pray to God to intervine on all the sorrow I've seen (U Know I mean?)
You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna
Nothin' can stop you if that's your type of persona (Persona!)
Life is short enough don't make me say it 10 times (10Times!)
I'll kick over for mine even in the end times (Times)
I can beat the system, come on, let's say it with me
Show me some optimism, we can take over the city (We can take over the city!)

Real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway

There comes a time in your life, you gotta go for yours
Stay invaders like the battle of forever more
I stay pedal to the metal foot on the floor
I'mma keep on the streets, knockin' down your doors
I'm by the dollar, like everybody oughtta be
Don't burn nobody and make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway just by the  economy
See I ain't coughin' unless it makes a profit
I'm droppin' it so hot, chick, like everyday gossip
Regardless of the climate, I'm gonna get it every day
Even if the bullets spray, I'm gonna get it anyway

This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won't give it but I did it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway

Sing
(La, la, la, la, la)
You know we blazin' up that
(La, la, la, la, la)
All around the world
 (La, la, la, la, la)
Our peoples gettin' money
(La, la, la, la, la)
Let me hear you sing

So let 'em hear the cellar by,  the collar
Makin' it harder for you to wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little to make your pain numb
Tippin' that bottle got you forgettin' where you came from (Forgettin' where you came from!)
But I'm the same one, where you think my name's from?
I'mma keep it movin' and never stop till the game's done (Never stop till the game's done!)
Forever we live it, forever we spit it, remember the minute
You witnessed the realest that ever did it (Quit it!)
Still I'm committed, no matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick, I'm puttin' on a clinic (I'm puttin' on a clinic!)
We a troubled times, swervin' through the double lines
You're in a head on collision 'cause now you servin' time (Now you servin' time!)

This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won't give it (Come on!), but I did it anyway
(I get it anyway)

Imma get it anyway

Hey man! Check this out. I got the best KUSH ever man
Aw, man... I've been so out... You got sent from heaven
All right, man, light it up, holmes
Ok, check it out man

I'm the original Dr. Greenthumb the rest are liars
I'm the one with the prescription to get you higher
I got every type of weed that you might desire
Go ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired
Any kind of flavor you savor
I can do you the favor
Just as long as you share with your neighbor
Some like the Sour D, that's an east coast swing
But on the west coast we all know KUSH is queen
Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
No stress, no bush, I'm pushing the KUSH
When I harvest put a K on the bag like the Nike Swoosh
I'm over the world, in case you wonder
I smoked everywhere I went, they call me the weed hunter
But no one does it better like we do in Cali
Just ask one of my patients cause they always tell me that the...

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

Kottonmouth Kings are down with us
Snoop Dogg and Dre are down with us
Cheech and Chong, they're down with us
But the DEA, they can get the nuts
On a high times cover, you might see us
Taking hits from the bong with the eight-foot Zong
With weed so strong, that knockout King Kong
Hit it one good time... Your mind's gone
Your eyes get red, and your mouth goes dry
Just get me when you want more and I'll supply
Red and meth said, "let's gets stoned" I said "How High"
They said "high enough to touch God and kiss the sky"
"That's a tall order But I think I got what you need"
I got the food for though and I'm ready to feed
So, follow my lead I got some gifts to bring
It's an everyday life for the Reefer King

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

I got the cream of the crop
My crop means cream
When it's time to bag it up I assemble the team
We're like the Yankees, most winning, grand champs of the herb
Nothing gets you like the type of medicine I serve
Lawyers, teachers, actors, street cleaners
No matter what they are, they all come to see the Reefer
They stay high 24 like Keifer
I tell 'em don't hit too hard, this is a Creepa
Woody Harrelson is down with us
Bruce Willis smokes all, he's down with us
Yeah, Willie Nelson is down with us
Who the fuck you think drives the ganja bus?
Dionne Warwick, she's down with us
She got caught at the airport with joints and such
So if anyone asks, she's down with us
And you don't wanna enter more weed in the Cannabis cup
I'm Greenthumb, I reign supreme, son
A strain better than mine, I've never seen one
The K.U.S.H. keeps you so high that you can't concentrate
Dave Chapelle, is down with us
Halle Barry, too, but don't tell no one
KRS-One is down with us
He's a blunt getting smoked and he can't wake up

K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

Say what?

I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, (?) try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'Cos I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Say what?

Ain't no-body better, on that you can bet (CY-PRESS!)
Wanna see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees and real DJs
Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big sucess
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion
No I ain't jokin, see my mic smokin'?
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

I lost my innocence at birth but I make no excuses
for the trivial things and the pain life induces
Bitches are wild, and so was I, young and stupid
it's incredible, what a shitty circumstance produces them
Criminals, led by the originals, high strung, motivated by the, principles
some of us out - he used to think we were invincible
on the corner bangin' and slangin' the high bitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand...

B-Real
So many, come and go in this lifetime that you serve
Faces change, liscenses' everywhere you turn
Gangsta's become blinded, visions become blurred
Learned to stay alive to the real side of the curb
You came along way but some still refuse to notice
they turned they back on us and they tried to provoke us
You ask about us, you talk trash about us
walk fast around us, but my block fast allowed us
Don't try to crowd us nigga, we'll smack you up
Look around and see who's willin' to back you up
You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter
Cause I know what these son-of-a-bitches are after
Your mind and soul, if your blind and cold
then your true sign is shown, then your fuckin' mind is blown

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but we're still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand...

I slay punks who don't know their own identity
You spit my name and use it like an obscenity
You got more skulls in your closet than a Kennedy
You on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
I can tell you what's crackin' and done get splitten
You corrosin' on the floor, shaken and snake bitten
You in a cold sweat like James of the names you knew
Don't mean shit to me and you ain't got a clue
of what's about to happen - interaction
Two worlds collide - one survives the reaction
Hold tight, keep yourself together
cause we're about to storm you like shitty weather

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: "You ain't shit to me"
Without you takin' it personally

Ten, proper years of bringin' funk
I, still count mine, it's hella gettin' over the hump
I got the loads on the skull, I got my hand on the pump
Still got the boss to go nutty on you punks (yeah!)
I don't wanna be the King of the Sing
Just a Soul Assassin for the Cypress Team
I rhyme and sing and make bitches scream
They love that old South Side gangsta lean
Call the Psycobeta, I guess you're crackin'
Turn into Mad Dog when I start rappin'
Look at hostile - ah, damn wild
Shake you up in a hurry from the voodoo child
Don't get caught up hangin' on the mortar
Hold on and I'll turn y'all punks all wild

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: "You ain't shit to me"
Without you takin' it personally

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, come on!

I'm tired of whack rappers and fame seekers
Like you know the deal to be in my same sneakers
I don't mind exposin' you hollow bitches
I got the medicine over the swallow bitches
You play roles like an actor but get no oscar
Gun spray, gunned away, cut from the roster
You're just an imposter, you lost your composure
Respect your exposure to bring you to your closure
But you're in denial and still remain vile
In a place within last style and senseless wild
I take you down the long trail you failed to keep up
That's when you get introduced to the street sweeper

I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself UP FOR CATASTROPHE!!!

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: "You ain't shit to me"
WITHOUT YOU TAKIN' IT PERSONALLY...

I remember times I hustle, times I struggle
Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
People tryin' to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cos it's a Chronicle
My life, I realise I'm responsible for obstacles
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all commited to stay
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on
'Cos you'll keep goin' crazy 'til your mind is gone

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

I been around for many days, of musical mainstays
Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
The Original Pyscho-Baiter
Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later
Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more
Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect
Now, what's (?) all with this year 2000's?
We puttin the Smackdown and we ain't clownin'
Not many have lasted
Since we first blasted
Up on the scene, singin' about the dream
Recruitin' for our team, niggas know what I mean
?Damn?, you defy, when you live or die

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

Times I hated, times I waited
Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?
Still hatin', creatin' all the evil now
Your insecurties are showin', exposin' you
You're trippin' on me and showin' emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me

I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage (barking)
Not that many can deal with the fury
Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
I kill and observe and go in an instant
I bring the pain like the ?Rampark? Prison
I kept it right for the brother to the ?Chullo?
Something I bump when your gates in the (?)

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you decieve me?

It Ain't Easy,
but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy

It turn's to a slaughter
You wanna think about chilling the fuck out,
You all gonna Top Allah, Pop collar,
Niggas, Latin Thungs
All my family love barillas
Beginners get pushed to back of the pack
Invented and lend out, without not a tech
You're on the top of the game
But you work on a name till one day
To put us in the walk of fame
Don't call a name to recall the fame
Eventually Dru is in the Hall of Fame
You know what the deal is,
You know what the heal is,
You know who the Real is,

I test myself, just to shut up and proove
That the C-Y-P-R-E-S-S
Got you funky, while I'm real deaf
Put it to the test, and you will confess
Soul Assassins is the best
Check it homeboy, got to spot cracking (crackin)
Six LP, from that Thugged-out Latin
Turn the heat up, and keep it hot
Always give ya mo', and then thank
We got to freak the Hip Hop and the hot ride

Had first 'self titled', became an Idol

We some real life hustlers, playin games in the street
We got that low-ri-der, scrapin dippin on three (low-ri-der)
So pop your collar, give a holla, throw yo' dubs in the air
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin freaky tonight

Now when people are done, bumpin they head to this
You wonder why you wanted anything instead of this
We been makin you bounce, for many years already
Rock steady and cut, many niggaz to confetti
But I just want to blaze it up; whether it's the mic or a spliff
Yes my gift is to amaze you all
Thought I couldn't come for ten my friend, but guess what?
I slay niggaz and still savin my best nut (low-ri-der)
But you better cover your eyes, cause you never know when
I spit it out and start some flowin
I drop rhymes that grow like trees you're smokin
Ear drums feel like lungs, your brain's chokin
Just let it soak in, seep in, creep in
I'm keepin, all you motherfuckers in the deep end (low-ri-der)
You wanna trip? Then I got luggage
I stuff you in and send you off, cause you ain't rugged

Aww, comin through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby
Got that junk, for yo' trunk, goin gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playin games in the street (low-ri-der)
We got that low-ri-der, scrapin dippin on three
So pop yo' collar, give a holla, throw the dubs in the air (low-ri-der)
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin freaky tonight

Cause, we're Cypress Hill, come on and ride with us
Just get inside, we bouncin dippin, chop it up real tough
Lean to the side, pimp yo' hat, tilt yo' seat on back
Don't front on me, baby boy, and break bread with the sack (low-ri-der)

I be the vato with the fine hoodrat in the ranfla
Always roll deep on the streets like the mafia
Pleito, just might come back and haunt ya
Flossin too much, no vato's gonna want ya
Not right here homes, we're past all of that
Makin that feria, spittin that raps
Ya me conoces, I'm down for my calle
Cypress Ave, y a pudo les madre (low-ri-der)
Ya tu sabes, we don't play that shit
Any pendejo's gettin hit up quick
Whassup ese? What hood you claim?
Now throw it up and down like it ain't no thang (low-ri-der)
Hands in the air with the pinky rings
Soul Assassins, runnin everything
To all you vatos, make sure you check this
In every barrio, I'm well respected (low-ri-der)

Aww, comin through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby
Got that junk, for yo' trunk, goin gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playin games in the street (low-ri-der)

As I sit in my silver stack thinking about way back
Even before I started blazing the chronic sack
I was a go wild unfocused troublesome kid
Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
I was at unimpressionable age through a faze
An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
Hanging over my head being wicked and loud
And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
They come at me from all angles and dangles
Memories in front of me, but I wont run away
I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
But I don't want to get locked away cause I whack bitches
I left those ways back in the old days
So go away I don't got no time to throw away

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I got my education on the streets
And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
To say whatever I went through or going through
Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you
Learn how some of these record companies be holdin you
Attaching an image in the end controllin you
But we set out to set ourselves apart
And let these people know just what they had from the start
It's like Ghostface said we studied our art form
We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
People slept on me and doubted my skill level
But I'm tenacious and I got a strong will level
You been introduced to some of the real rebels
Injected with venom from god to kill devils

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I remember my days as youth
Teenage gangsters with somethin to prove
See man amuse and we creep and we strew
Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
Just -- having fun but you crazy kids
Never thought about no prison beds
Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
Never see the kids all fucking wild
But that's the game and shit don't change
Get respect for smoking brains
You get a name and you build your rep
You courting fools coming in your set
Before you know we're having fun
Slamming doping and packing gun
Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases

Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so we can survive)

It's a rep thing, haters feel they chest pain
They feel it in they heart, I was there to test things
Didn't arrest (?), the bullet-proof vest team
These niggas shoot first they they askin (?) names

But really, niggas get money out here
And hey, everyday is sunny out here

Scraped on the six-five with the HAND ON THE PUMP SONG

It's been a while now
Been around the block many miles
Many faces, many places
that I found friends
Places where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I can call home
Places I can get stoned
I just wanna be alone
When I'm feelin' in my zone
People want to knock me down
'cos they never have their own
They won't get the best of me
But they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me?
I'm not, what you s'posed to be?
You could not give a DAMN
Coulda just Killed A Man
Sawn off in my hand
But I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my piece of mind
Feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, Trouble always found me,
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide,
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come INSIDE!

No trouble's at my door!
You want trouble, c'mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

Trouble on the line, all the fuckin' time
Got me contemplatin' the solution, the fusion my wicked mind
Got suckers that hate me but it don't really matter
I'm like a gat when I bust, niggas run and scatter
Movin' in circles, throwin' elbows and fists
You got to be a real nigga in a Cypress Hill pit
Lotta critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn
I try to put it to you BLUNTLY so you bitches can learn
That no-body get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there a lot of you have been fooled
In to actually believin' that some shit is cool
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit from somebody else
I'm down for myself, I back up myself
Put in all on the line make sure that I'M FELT!

No trouble's at my door!
You want trouble, c'mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

Nooooo!

Look, the wall's closin' in
and my shoe's wearin' thin
Had to be the biggest clown that you couldn't comprehend
Some hated on my game, said I wouldn't be the same
Called me "Rock Superstar", "Insane In The Brain"
But I know I haven't changed
So I brush you to the side
Trouble's knockin' on the door, Anxious jus' to come inside
'times I gotta block it out, no-one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin' and I can't seem to lock it out
Got my hands on the phone, I don't wanna have to talk
If you're feelin funky son, then I guess you gotta jump
I can see it in your eyes, you don't seem to recognise
I wouldn't fall into your trap, for many lives to compromise
I'm not fallin' for your shit, you ain't gonna take me there
You can talk all you want, but I don't got your weight to bear

No, trouble's at my door!
(You want trouble right now? C'mon
You want trouble right now? C'mon)

You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?

Go!

Seems like only yesterday the dream became so clear.
All was possible and God, it felt so near!
So I suffered and I bled, I truly did believe.
Years have come and gone, but just where has it brought me?

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Strobing snapshots of my past become a blurring flash
Just one thing can make it all come flooding back

If I'd stopped just once to look back maybe I would see
Just how far I've come, but it took it's toll on me

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Blink of an eye!
Blink of an eye!
Blink of an eye!

That's just how fast your life can change.
In the blink of an eye, everything's erased.

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Yea!

I never saw whatever it was
That came and hit me from behind.
Then I awoke enraged and confused,
How could I have been so blind?

Life's escaping, don't pretend,
Judgement comes, but who knows when.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!
Blunt force trauma to the head!

Blazing through life at the speed of sound.
Don't stop to look at the signs.
Suddenly everything crashes around you.
When we forget, life reminds.

Clock is running, falling sand,
Time is slipping through your hands.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!

It's too late!
It's too late!
It's too late!
Too late!

Blunt force trauma.
Blunt force trauma.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!

It's too late!
It's too late!

Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?

Can you feel it building?
Devastation is on the way.
Feel the hair on the back of your neck
As the rush begins.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel,
Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel,
Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel?

Can you feel it slipping
As you lose your grip on me?
Can you face that I won in the end?
I can't keep from laughing.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.

Don't you see it coming?
When you've caught on, it's too late.
When it hits, don't forget who I am,
Don't forget this face.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.

Breathing new life.

Cold blooded,
Ice in my veins.

Cold blooded,
Ice in my veins.
Ice in my veins.

Spit in your face, another worthless liar.
I know your kind.
Save me the smile, you're just a cut-throat bastard.
I read your mind.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.
What can you do after you've killed it slowly?
Where can you go after you bled it dry?

For now I'll let you believe,
I let you get to me.
Aren't you in for a shock,
You stupid motherfucker?

You'll get what you deserve,
A victim of your own game.
You're already dead to me,
Your turn to get played.

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Having control - the only validation
You constantly need.
Power to you becomes intoxication
On which you feed.

Spewing your lies and your manipulation,
Playing with lives to you is just a game.
Being around you makes me fear that you might
Get on my skin and then contaminate.

For now I'll let you believe,
I let you get to me.

(You don't even see it coming, do you?)

You'll get what you deserve,
A victim of your own game.
You're already dead to me,
Your turn to get played.

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Your face just serves to remind
Everything that I don't want to be.
Guess my mind was made up long ago,
You won't get one thing more from me!

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.

Forced my strength out of determination,
I've survived this long on will.
Dropped so many times that I've lost count.
Never stopped me once, never known anything else.

Anything else.

Try and break me down, I'll
Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't

Suffer, sacrifice, or walk away.
Make your play and risk it all.
New found power pumping through my veins,
Based on brotherhood,
Once it starts it can't be stopped.
(can't be stopped)

Try and break me down, I'll
Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't

Pick my teeth back up and crawl.

Sometimes it seemed like it just wasn't meant to be
Anger and sorrow were all that I would ever feel
Sometimes I'd dream the man that had it all was me,
Then I'd awake each time to cold reality.

But I can't wait for things to change.
Complacency is not my way.
Self-absorbed, I had lost my faith, I was
Breaking down from your apathy, now it
Feeds my hatred for all you stand for and
I can't live like this one minute more, so
Just how much blood do you have to swallow?
Before you can lead, you must refuse to follow
Now I bite the hand that starves me
Don't look so surprised it's you that created me

Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't.

Pick my teeth back up and

Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can't.

Crawl

Explode!

I feel you stare, watch me not care.
Glare at the freak, you've no control,
Feel your eyes probing me, judging me
Only makes me want to

Explode, just explode!

You don't know me but you fear me.
Tainted with ink, riddled with holes,
Staring and pointing, stupidity
Only makes me want to

Explode, just explode!
Explode, just explode!

All that's you see, scars that's made me.
See in your eyes, all you despise,
Judge me by what you see, leave me be,
Get away I'm going to

Explode, just explode!
Explode, just explode!

Fear what you don't understand.
It will always be.
Fear what you don't understand.
As it always was.

Fear what you don't understand.
It will always be.
Fear what you don't understand
I just want to

Fuck you, I'm through.
I want nothing more from you.
My sanity is wearing thin.

Irate, I hate.
You determined your own fate
Now everything is caving in

Fuck your power trip and
Fuck your attitude and
Fuck your bloated ego, too.
Fuck your history, your tragedy, your misery
But most of all, fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Fuck this, all of this
Bitch and moan and bleed and piss
Seconds away from goin' down

Go ahead and push me
Your fakery, your butchery
Is nothing compared to my hate for you

Fuck your apathy and
Fuck your empathy and
Fuck your nihilism, too
Fuck your bitter pills, take em all, you
Never will
But most of all, fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,

You consulate, just a touch
Let myself be considered for themselves
Let's sit up
Hear that sound
It's not time to hang out

The summer eclipse doesn't exist
Don't watch it and hate the world

You're the one that slipped

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

Fuck your power trip and
Fuck your attitude and
Fuck your bloated ego, too.
Fuck your history, your tragedy, your misery
But most of all, motherfucker fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Fuck you!

There were times when I questioned my reasons.
Thought I wouldn't last.
Seemed the hand of God held my head underwater.
Somehow I fought back.

It's still not over yet.
No, it won't let me quit.

Found myself more than just once
Praying down on my knees.
My search for answers only led to more questions.
Sometimes for faith you've got to bleed.

By now I've bled my share,
Now it's my turn to redeem.

When it comes my way I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

Give all you have because you believe,
Sell your mortal soul.
And if you're not a predator, then, oh - you better pray.
Bet it all now or fold.

But there's still a danger there.
Don't become one of them.

When it comes my way I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

For all I've done - some good some bad,
Don't hang me just yet!
Judge me not on one thing I've done,
See my whole life instead!

When it comes my way, I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

Why have we waited so long,
Suppressing the power inside?
Tear away all that was wrong,
Something too massive to hide.

It's time to rip the chain from your neck,
Let go the past as you purge.
Free now from everything weighing you down,
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Cleansing yourself of the past,
Learn from mistakes and move on.
Conquering new ground at last,
Unite and become twice as strong.

It's time to rip the chain from your neck,
Let go the past as you purge.
Free now from everything weighing you down,
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Hope was all that kept me sane.
Rise above and prove myself.
I'll survive without your help.
Shut you out, my strength comes from within.

New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Power!
Power!

I'm sickened.
I know I've been betrayed,
But I keep ignoring
The warning signs.

You tell me
That I'm not beneath you,
But you act above me.
Knives in my spine.

Now with all the money in the world
You can't buy my respect.
Yeah, it's just a matter of pride
But that's all I've got left.

I reach up
For your hand as you stand
Looking down on me, but
You turn your back.

I believed you.
Now everything
That we had that I thought was sacred
Has turned to black.

Now with all the money in the world
You can't buy my respect.
Yeah, it's just a matter of pride
But that's all I've got left.

Right!

Identity murdered, malicious intent.
I'm recreating myself at last.
Rise up from destruction, start over again,
Reborn, I'm now erasing the past.

Did you think for a second I
Wouldn't bother to question why
You always put me last?
Can you look straight into my eyes
As you're excreting all your lies?
Your time is coming fast!

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!
I'm reborn.

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!
I'm reborn.

Everything now that would stand in my way
Is doomed to take the impact to come.
You think you can stop me, you'd best think again.
You want a piece of me? Come get some!

Did you think for a second I
Wouldn't bother to question why
You always put me last?

I'm reborn.

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!
I'm reborn.

So everything that you've throwing at me
Has only helped me make up my mind.
And all you do will amount to nothing.
You can't effect me, don't even try.

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!
I'm reborn.

I'm reborn.
I've seen the light!

"Save me from myself", I call out,
But no one hears my plea.
Burn my candle fast from both ends.
Nightmares grow from dreams.

You don't know, you can't see thrugh my eyes,
So you don't know me!
You don't know what's going through my mind,
But can you help me?

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Intensity that grows within me,
Reflections of my pain.
I'll create or I'll destroy,
But either way it's always in my veins.

You don't know, you can't see through my eyes,
So you don't know me!
You don't know what's going through my mind,
But can you help me?

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.

Now that I'm all alone
Painfully aware
I'm starting to feel the cold
Knowing you're not there

Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company

Come and look inside, hope you like what you see
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed

Throwing a shadow on
Every thought I have
Knowing that something's gone
Echoes in my head (echoes in my head)

Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company

Come and look inside, hope you like what you see (denying what you see)
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me (scared of what is me)
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me (they claw, yeah)
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed (the soul is left to bleed)

Wake up!

Our lives are entwined, can't escape
But you and I have never stood face-to-face
Still I can't get away
Think that you can just step right in/
Push me out and then fuck things all up again?
It never seems to end.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Wake up!
Wake up!

Cling to skeletons, fearing change,
Paralyzed thinking what the future will bring.
You're killing everything.

Pure adrenaline, I tear in
Hatred is my fuel
Truth dissects you again
And you've run out of friends

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

And now it's time, the countdown begins.
Extracting the truth, what was from what is.
And once and for all we lay it to rest
And never look back again.

Never again!
Never again!
Never again!
Never again!

I can't believe all the things done to me.
Sight unseen.
You don't know one fucking thing but you
Judge me.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you're better than me?
You better wake up 'cause you know it's a lie.
Do you think that you're better than me?

This is the breakedown.
ha!
try to follow.


inside I'm crying, dying to ask why
We're working for nothng from 9 to 5
I can feel the exhaustion wearing on me
can't face the fact that -
I am not free

freedom is a lie we learned to believe
like a book with no pages we pretend to read
you envy me - let me tell you where I came from
I ran like hell through my imaganation
just to get away from what i did not understand
like how a boy becomes a coward and calls himself a men
and everyone around him pats him on the back
happily obvious ignoring all the facts
knick knack paddi whack give a dog a bone
sit, stay, roll over, run away from home
this is what we teach to the demons we create
avoid your inner conscience,
and hide from your mistakes
then lie awake hunted by your messed up thoughts
contemplating actions afraid of getting caught

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

I wonder why we're still falling for the same old tricks
it seems like we're  all broken and need to be fixed
were like robots aboarding the economy that failing anyway
and won't let us be who we wanna be
its sickening a world on the go
I need a triple tall hot latte and a blueberry scone
and for lunch, I'll take number 5
with a large diet coke
and an extra side of fries
and you can feed me lies
I'll eat them up to
at night I pray to god and ask him what to do

this is how wer'e wating on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on te edge

and millions of children, dying of hunger
we cant see the lightning, cant hear the thunder
we are going under
if things don't change soon
the world will be dead by tomorrow at noon
raped of her glory
raped of her life
raped like the husbands rape their wives
and the wives have also lost their minds
drowning their kids
and feeding them lies..

all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I
all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I, aye

I don't wanna sit and wait for shit to hit the fan
but you can, if you want
with the family you brought
to the land of all promises
where all you ever wanted was a chance to take a stand
against the world that took your confidence
because you have been on it since
the day you turned ten
and your dad said you have to earn your money to spend
thats what you did - you became part of the system
working to earn a respect of old rich men.
shining their shoes, and pressing their pants
playing their games and dancing their dance
basically home to get a chance -
a chance to get notice, to maybe advance
but, let me let you in on a little secret -
you can package your pride, and tell theme to keep it
because you dont need them. they need you caus' you feed them
you do the work while they sit tall cause you are lucky you have a job at all
right?

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

so one more time everybody, alright.

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

here we go


all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I
all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I, aye

No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie

It twists and turns
Into something that is not to be
What truth is left
What's abandoned as the life flew by
Our words are broken

We commit to our sacrifice
The betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie
Our words are broken

Our subconscious bias
Confirms what we already believe
There is no message, there is no value
Just the sheltering of false ideas

Tear our thoughts
Into splinters
Set the sense
That's forced to remember
Words get thrown
Out of focus as we
Test our will
Dissolve to nothing
Break all bounds
Of unfair holding
Track this line
To journey's end
We're breaking down

It all comes out
In desire we forgot to face
Take down ambition
Or in our minds we will always fail

The faceless remember
The Hours and the fallen words
Connect the fallacies
Detect autonomy
There is a limit
To the never ending sky

We must come to terms
Admit we are defeated
We must come to terms
With bias and deception
Stand up and be counted
In uniformity

It sets a high mark
For what our minds can endure

Is there life in the distance
A faint beacon of light
Let us fall to the inner ceiling
Of everything we see

The endless resistance
Decides upon the fallen words
Direct the agony to a non-response
And forgiveness to an idealized mirage

It informs all decisions
And challanges us to dare

All has now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high
If there was something out there
I've learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care

Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

As always in these matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons
Never to share again

This is how it all begins

Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

This is how it all begins

Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

This is a ghost town, alive with the echoes of failures fled
Lit up by shining faces that parade these streets
What used to be of humility is gone
You walk the mounds of skull and bones
Where living is denied, I see more movement in decomposition than in those hollow eyes

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

Set flame to the ensnarers and pierce that ornate shield
Branded by what claims you, you wear the mark of death
Tear from loss and agony, a character defined
Stripped of all but tragedy, what life is left to find?
Go now, until there's nothing left
Go now, the dying has begun

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

So I flee from all that is me to hide behind this pale dead face
Whatever happened to desire, want and need?
Whatever happened to integrity?
Imagination is a curse in all of this
Whatever happened to the ones left behind?

This is a ghost town, our bodies dragged through endless streets
Go now, to never return
I've seen more pitiful humiliation than you could never hide

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

Why do I see her through never-ending nights?
Why do I see her wearing nothing but the dark?

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I know where you live, I can see it through your darkness
And when you sleep, I hear the heart that beats you

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I fought into the distance, a life that does not connect
Time played out its part on the strings that bind us

Encounters in silence, words elude the fading night
Wish I could fathom what is too hard to tell

Her head hangs low in the silence of the room
Her head hangs low, she takes a bite out of her heart

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I left my head at home,
Buried in the backyard with the dog.
I've thought of leaving more times than once.
I'm leaving you all alone.
I tried so hard to be the rock,
But all I felt like was a wet sponge.

I want to run, I just can't.
The things it takes to be a man
I'm on a road
I'm not proud of the things I have done
Don't let my living bring you down
You'll never know how much it hurts
To nod when I'm the son
I'll never stand and watch you drown

I'm under a spell.
This isn't what I want for us.
We've held it all together this long.
My spines deep as well.
My heart is bigger than you know.
This family is just a sad song
I want to run, I just can't.
The things it takes to be a man.

I'm on a road.

Aus Liebe zum Rap, ich ziele mit der Gat auf deine Stirn
Und jage die Kugel in dein verficktes Gehirn
Plündere deine Tasche und verpiss mich von dir
Kann mirs im Geschäft nicht mal leisten zu klauen
Dann heißt es auch schon gleich in den Bau
Weil ich auch noch Gangster bin wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft
Nee Quatsch, war ein Witz, mach in wieder an, ich hab Schiss
Sido findet meine Witze nicht zum Lachen
Kann man von einem Mario Barth-Fan auch wirklich nicht erwarten
Nach diesen beiden Zeilen ist der Beef auch schon beendet
Denn ich bin undissbar, Sido Legende

Weil wir G's sind

Vor gut einem Jahr begann ich, mich in die Szene zu schleichen
Hab in diversen Interviews erzählt, dass ich extrem weich bin
Ich wurde von niemandem ernst genommen und stellte keine Bedrohung dar
So wurde mir die Tür geöffnet, konnte reinspazieren, dem großen Plan
Sie umzubringen, näher gekommen, weil ich nun drin in dem Game bin
Versteckt in einem Schäfchen mit einer AK-47
Ihr Leben in meiner Gewalt, ich halt es in teuflischen Händen
Um gegen die Toys anzukämpfen, die in Deutschland so rappen
Ich habe den ersten Schritt bereits getan mit einer weiteren Scheibe
Du musst sie dir nur noch kaufen und wir bestreiten den Zweiten
Dieses Album wird ein bestes sein, bis mein nächstes erscheint
Nicht ein einziger Drecks-Vergleich oder peinliche Hashtag-Lines
Einfach keine Musik für die Unterschicht, denn die ist viel zu dumm für mich
Bisher war deutscher Rap entweder kindisch oder schwuchtelig
Die ersten sagen schon, ich wäre der Beste zur Zeit
Nicht mehr lange und dann hat es auch der Letzte gepeilt


Wenn ein süßes Wesen vor dir steht, den Colt in der Hand hält
Ein gezielter leiser Schuss aus einer goldenen Glock fällt
Dann ist es der Wolf in 'nem Schafspelz

There are no words you could choose
That could change the way I feel and make me wanna stay
And I know how you look in my eyes
That there's something on your mind that you're not gonna say

Ooh, you feel me slippin' out
Nothin' to talk about
So why are you still holding on?

Ooh, it's nothing that you said
The voices in my head
Are clearer than your foolish reasons

You wouldn't have it any other way
You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no (I'm tired, so tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)

You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no

You are the one I would choose
But a haunted heart wants what a haunted heart wants
And you know how you look in my eyes
But there's nothing more now that I could even say to you

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya
I should have left it now it's over
But here we are again

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya (I'm tired, so tired)
No need to question my composure (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)
Don't wanna do it again

You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no (I'm tired, so tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no

You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no (I'm tired, so tired)
You wouldn't have it any other way (I don't want to do it again)
You wouldn't have it any other way, oh no

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya (I'm tired, so tired)
No need to question my composure (I'm tired, I'm feeling tired)
Don't wanna do it again

The moon is blue and dim
The tide is surely rushing in

She knows it's ready when
Her eyes are almost open
The thunder moves her skin
Let's hope that she knows how to swim

She knows it's ready when

You only saw the dark side of me
Bring me back to my reality
I have lost my belief

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way
Imagine a place for us, where you and I stay

I have lost the will to fly
With broken wings I can't even try
I have lost my belief

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way
Imagine a place for us, where you and I stay

Picture a world for us
A promise to set me free
Imagine a place for us
A promise will set me free
(Picture a world for us)
(A promise to set me free)

(A promise)

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way

Oh

My life was brought into a nightmare
Dark shadows surrounded me
Five times the pain of torture
It buried deep within me
It makes me shiver down my spine
To even think of it
Talk to me
What is the reason?
I'm finished
Answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

I'm going insane it feels like I am lost
The panic, the fear, the mind tricks is haunting me
Is this my destiny?
Talk to me
What is the reason?
I'm finished
Answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

Leaving our tears behind
Angels of clarity
Show me the way
Leaving my past behind
Angels of clarity
Show me the way
Angels of clarity

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

Save me
Falling down (falling down)
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside (falling down)

I am dead by anxiety

This come to an end?

Here is no one left to trust
Raise a light, one that I can see
Now reverse this enormous pain for this life to remain
I am walking through, watching what's left

Hold me close

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being erased

I crawl my way through every day
Raise your light, one that glows for me
Give me a sign, light my path, take me higher
I am walking through fire
Standing alone, abandoned to fate

Walk me through

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being, being erased

Being erased

Is this all that is left for me?

Hold me close

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black

I'm fading to gray, losing all track of time
I died in your own storm
I'm shattered in pieces
Lift up my eyes, I am falling too far

I open my heart for you

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

I'm fading away, I lose in the end (I lose in the end)
A reason to be, find me a miracle
Free my life from destruction
What am I worth now?
My happy ending long gone

I open my heart for you

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

(I never felt so alone) There's no turning back
(Forgiveness is long gone) I'm falling behind
(I never felt so closed) The legions are winning
(I'm falling behind) I'm losing my worth now
(I'm falling behind) My life becomes lifeless
(I'm falling behind)

Standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

Some days I could barely get through
Still I knew I stood never too far from you

Look at me now, I made it
Feel my heart now, I made it
Reaching things now, I never thought possible
Here I am now, I made it
Here is my life, my true dream

I'm not afraid
Even through the darkest moment
I never gave up
In my mind what I'm reaching for
Is coming closer
My dream never faded out
I never gave it up

Look at me now, I made it

What I have in me, in my mind is you
I would die if we were through
What I'm feeling now, what I'm heading into
I am lost in pain without you

So cold, so alone

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through

All the nights I've prayed, must this all be untrue?
I am not prepared to be strong
I just can't believe I am losing you
Unprepared to carry on
I can't see you walk away

So cold, so alone

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through
I am losing you forever, I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground forever (Forever)

Distant, so far, destiny is selecting me
I can't be strong, life is disconnecting me
Now, loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days you were there protecting me

So cold, so alone

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through
I am losing you forever, I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground forever (Forever)

I know I won't see your face again, ...hey
Are you sitting there alone, ...hey-ey
Are you thinking like me, of the laughing times,
of all the sad and loving times?
everything that's left of us
is fading away

Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful
Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful
Promise me to look back at us, as a time in your life, you enjoyed

Surrounded by flames everywhere,
what I used to be, I'm not even there
The absence of you is killing me, ...hey-ey,

Sometimes you've said I didn't listen to your words
That I even made you cry
Maybe I didn't show in every possible way (Possible way)
How much I cared

I'm sorry for not being myself
For everything ending this way
Maybe I, maybe you could need this change
I'm sorry for, for everything

I wish that I could stop your tears from falling down
Probably, I'd make it worse
Maybe I wasn't always there, it doesn't mean I don't care
Whatever it was

I'm sorry for not being myself
For everything ending this way
Maybe I, maybe you could need this change
I'm sorry for, for everything

We're minutes away from saying goodbye for all of time

But something was always here holding me back from it
Kept me from making it happen
It's so unreal
The clock is ticking, the time is passing me by
Passing me by

Everywhere (Everywhere)
All that is near
Now it's time, to show them all
What I am, who I am, what I think

Anwser me it's all that I'm asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer
My despair

So it seems tat I've found my escape out from your prison
I am once again myself, stronger than ever
Feeling so free, feeling secure
Nothing can get me now, nothing at all
Feeling alive, it took me longer than I ever expected

Everywhere (Everywhere)
All that is near
Now it's time, to show them all
What I am, who I am, what I think

'Cause of you, I'm lyin' awake at night
All I'm seeing are pictures of you
As I close my eyes
I fade my way into the laws of my dream world

It's a place of trust, will you meet me there?
There's no time to spare; come on, show me you care
Here we can make anything become real

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see?
Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

'Cause of you, my tries do not think of you
They just end up in one million thoughts
It's way too much to mention
See what I mean when you see my creation

It's a place of trust, I can meet you there
There's no time to spare; come on, show me you care
What you believe, it will here become real

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me, can't you see

Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

Trapped inside my own dreams, I'm not complaining
Leave behind a lie of any kind, here it can disappear

Try not to wake me, let me be

I will do whatever it takes to make this stop

Hurting me (Hurting me)

Hurting me (Hurting me)
Burning me (I won't let it go)

'Cause what you see is real and true
You can't take that away from me
No matter what you do
You can't take that away from me
Won't let it slip away, it means too much to me
'Cause what you see is real and true

You see things from a different point of view
Why should I listen, why should I let you in?
(Why should I even trust you?)
We are like two different worlds apart
Won't let you in on what is rightfully mine
(Why should I even trust you?)

Hurting me (Hurting me)
Breaking me (Breaking me)
Hurting me (Hurting me)
Burning me (I won't let it go)

I've been running all night long
And the pulse is pounding in my chest
Now I am here, there are feelings that I just must express

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late
Open for me, cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late

Gotta get this outta my system
I've gathered my strength, ripped my blindfold off
I'm ready now, I have stayed in the dark with my mind switched off

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late
Open for me, cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late

I don't wanna be out here on my own
I don't wanna be outside in the cold
I don't wanna be completely alone
I just wanna be right where I belong

Ergh!

Open for me
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don't say it's too late

Don't try to help, we're alone in this war
All efforts will be futile, progressing bit by bit as I'm fighting to kill it
Replace all my frustration with new inspiration, watch me climb
Fighting this addiction, I'm bleeding

Evil's on my left, good is on my right
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

For once, listen to me, now I am crying it out
Tired of hiding it inside, now I am screaming it out
Replace all my frustration with new inspiration, watch me climb
Fighting this addiction, I'm bleeding

Evil's on my left, good is on my right
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

I am trying to figure me out, why I'm bleeding
No one will ever understand me; it's like I'm two faced
Understand me; it's like I'm two faced
Understand me

Evil's on my left, good is on my right
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It's like I'm two faced, it's like I'm two faced

You remember me, you remember us
It was magical when I felt your touch
It's a strong memory still today
It feels so good with your body close
Those days are gone, time flies away
But it's what I'm dreaming of still today

I'm sad to see that this was all we had
But within my heart, you'll have a place deep within my heart
A special place for you no matter what was said and done
Within my heart, you'll always be inside my heart as long as I live

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go
Within my heart, within my heart
(Within my heart, within my heart)
Within my heart, within my heart

Within my heart

What once was strong and filled with passion
Has withered away and turned to nothing
But you're all I'm dreaming of still today

It's sad that what we had is dead and gone
But within my heart, you'll have a place within my heart
A special place forever, no matter what happened
You have a place in my heart, within my heart for eternity

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go
Within my heart, within my heart
(Within my heart, within my heart)
Within my heart, within my heart

Every night I have this dream
Will I find the right way back again into your open arms?
Every night you're in my dreams
And I know that we will meet again
It's written in the stars and within my heart

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go

You should know
You should know

Don't tell me to let go the past
'Cause it's all I've got
Though it all went too fast, memories will last

For what's wrong I apologize
Trying to go on with a broken heart
I thought it through like a thousand times
What went wrong, what went wrong?

I am trying so hard

You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here

I want you to know
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you here
I cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Not without you here

Don't tell me to, to let go of you
It hurts in me, say that it's not too late
That it's just a dream

From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry
Trying to go on with a broken heart
Can't get closure inside of this story
What went wrong, what went wrong?

I am trying so hard

You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here

I want you to know
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you here
I cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Not without you here

All the memories still remain
I think of them again and again
My abilities are restrained
Can't get rid of you and the pain

(I want you to know, I thought you should know)

You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here

Dispite our past I still breathe for you
The sign is chosen for destiny
And this is all I see.

Leaves falling down falling side by side
All I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down anywhere I hide
All I was had now in tears I drown.

You made my beliefs grow a little stronger
I'm a dead end can't feel it no longer
When I dream I am still awake
And this is what I see.

Leaves falling down falling side by side
All I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down anywhere I hide
All I once had now in tears I drown.

Leaves fall down

But life is short i'm running faster all the time
Strength and beauty destined to decay
So cut the rose in full bloom

'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

We must dream of promised lands and fields
That never change in season
As we move towards no end we learn to die
Red tears are shed on grey

'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

Crazy weather
Too near the eye of the storm
The ice that cracks our walls
Our tiny shelter from the cold

We raise the curtain for endless rain
A tricky thought stuck in back of your brain
Slippery the cradle, water that burns
Silent the hour, waiting our turn

Our bodies our changing beneath the touch of the rain
We'll build a new constellation
We'll save ourselves for better days

Play for me
Play that on my grave now
You'll play for me
Play from the eye of the storm

We ran for shelter when everything changed
We made a promise to keep things the same
Play for me
Play for some kind of control
It keeps us whole

How hollow heart
Cracks the walls around me
Out of the eye of the storm
Endless the rain
Endless the rain

These are the rules
Learn to play
And what you take from here
No price can pay

You'll play for me now
Play for some kind of control
It makes us whole
Study the lines
Learn your part
You'll play for me
Play for some kind of control

Left outside
The frost leaves its mark
Saved, safe
In the dark

Play for me
Play that on my grave now
You'll play for me
Play from the eye of the storm

We ran for shelter when everything changed
We made a promise to keep things the same
Play for me
Play for some kind of control
It keeps us whole

White sheets run red
Red sheets burn white
This is not your bed
So very far from home again

Dirty river water runs all the way to your room
The water carries memories
Let them guide you

Take a breath and make your way back down
Against the stream

Upstream against the knives of cold
Will time destroy the weight of what we know?

Draw the map a circling spiral down
Destination your middle name
Momentum saved
Now just wait

Soak this in river water

You might be asleep or you might be awake
It doesn't matter now
Dirty river water holds the waste that you make
It doesn't matter now

Upstream against the knives of cold
Will time destroy the weight of what we know?

Now just wait

Your white sheets run red

You haven't heard a word of what I've said
You can't drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

You haven't heard a word of what I've said
You can't drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

And this is not your bed
Your white sheets run red

You haven't heard a word of what I've said

It's not me in the reflection
Just a phantom in the glass

You still believe what you see
Your obsession
Reflection
Concession
Aggression
Your reflection
And you believe what you see in the prism
Who would you be?
A phantom in the glass
Holding on to me

And you only believe what you can see

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Seeing what you want to see
See what you fear to be

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Show me what you want to be
Seeing what you want to see

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Seeing what you want to see
Show me what you want to be

Your obsession
With the reflection
Is a concession
To our regression

You're easier said than done
It's easy to make that choice alone
We'll never know whose won

I want to carve my name in her noise
Find comfort in these childhood toys
I want to be dirty and clean at the same time

I never thought it'd be so easy to cut through me
No matter what you do it's too easy to cut through you

So we've been talking about 'cool' and its uh ramifications, and how it applies to the hip scene. But maybe you could give us some examples now, of the opposite of cool - 'uncool', just exactly what is 'uncool'?
Yeah, why-n't-we have some thoughts on that...

It-it-it's uncool to nod on the street corner waiting for the light to change.
And uh it uh... It-it's uncool to let anybody know your uncle is a registered pharmacist, uncool for the whole family.
You know, it's uncool to buddy with a known fink.
And it's uncool to ask "Where'd you get it?"
It's disastrously uncool to let friends use your penthouse as a forwarding address for packages from Mexico.
You know and it's uncool to ask "Where'd you get it?"
And it is uncool to wear shades after sunset.

Don't wake me up, I'm winning wars inside my head.
And maybe I'm weak, but not beneath the covers of this bed.
Asleep, I'm undefeated in this world of mine.
So let me stay inside this dream, and keep me from the light.
I built this place behind my eyes you'll never see.
And you can move my body, but please keep my mind asleep.
Beyond the galaxies where there's no space or time.
I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies.
I
I feel it in my bones, escape the world I know.
It's all in my control.
I
Just wanna see this way, blood pumping in my veins.
I feel it. I feel it!

Behind the darkness, there's a sea of neon lights.
And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside.
Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free.
Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality.
It's not enough for me to paint with black and white.
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life.
You think you travel far and never see the stars.
Cause the only way is if I say you can follow me that far.
I
I feel it in my bones, escape the world I know.
It's all in my control.
I
Just wanna see this way, blood pumping in my veins.
I feel it. I feel it!

I was born on a highway in a trainwreck
With a heart that was beatin' outta my chest
So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up
If I don't get it soon I know I'll bleed until I drop

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

There's a darkness and a hollow on the highway
Every cross on the road side tells a story
So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up
The story never ends as long as we have blood and guts

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
Can't get enough
I can't get enough

It ran off the track, 11/79
While the immigrants slept, there wasn't much time
The mayor came callin' and got 'em outta bed
They packed up their families and headed up wind

A poison cloud, a flaming sky
200,000 people and no one died
And all before the pocket dial
Yeah

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

Now I'm stranded, tied on the tracks
There's no hero, there's no villain
There's nobody I can blame, the story's still the same
I'm never satisfied, it's a problem with my brain

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

(Can't get enough) I can't get enough
(Can't get enough) I can't get enough
(Can't get enough) I can't get enough
(Can't get enough) I can't get enough

Again and again and again I get tested
Feels like the walls are closing in I can't escape it
It's everywhere I turn so I can't run from it
So many things I see make me sick to my stomach
Feel compassion and pain look at the world with disdain
But know that I'm part of the problem and it drives me insane
I see no light at the end of the tunnel
So I take no solace in a bullshit empty promise

So what the fuck am I supposed to do

But live like I got nothing left to lose

Again and again and again there's no end
To the bullshit and the drama and the fake fucking friends
It's me against the world I've made my peace with that
But fighting through this life alone I find no peace in that
Day after day I get more disillusioned
With every fuckin' person on earth myself included
Everybody's got there demons to battle
I just don't know how much more of this shit I can handle

I feel the weight of the world and the pressures so great
I can feel my heart break every step that I take
But I keep on yeah I gotta be strong
Gotta make my momma proud, I gotta be my father's son

You've got to find her. (You've got to find her.)
Your mother ain't fit to be alone.
Her rosary beads are gone, there's only one place she'd be.
The sun is nearly up, put your jacket back on and walk down the street.

Feel the wind start to shift, cold and biting.
Just like everything that's changed.
When you do find her, (when you do find her)
Take the only family that you've got back to home.

Head down, walk through the crowds and the families downtown.
You jealous bitter old man, it's just yourself you can't stand.
The man that took away your wife, coward that left you behind,
You would kill them both if you could. (Kill them both if you could)
Head down, cigarette in hand.
Concrete, cold brick and sando the place where she prays,
Where she suffers her days.
Sleepless nights with the dirt when the addiction hurts.
Up to that old white oak door church.

And that's where you find her in that last pew.

You touch her cold hand, your mother is gone.
In front of her God, needle in her arm.
The family plot will be filled.
The perfect ending to a tragedy.
Put her in the cold wet ground.
Finally at peace with her husband now.

Lost all will, empty house.
Hours strain, but months pass alone with your gun.
Blue-collar shipyard, your days have gone.

Lost it all for the promise of a normal life.
All taken from you when you lost your wife.
So you sit in that chair, waiting for death, barrel to your head.

You need to get out of this house.
I'll walk you down to town.
We'll go act our age, kick rocks, waste summer days.
Penny candy at the general store,
I'd buy us a pop if I had more.
Keep walking inland all day,
Spitting and cursing each others name.

"Ain't this what, ain't this what brothers are supposed to do?"
The blood between us, makes it all but true.

So we roll on through
Out past the quarries and sandpits too.
Swim out among the rocks and cliffs,
Ignorant youth keeps us from death.
Find our way out to the tracks.
The sun, it beats down on our backs.
Heaven help us if there's a train,
Dodge it like the beaches of Normandy.

"Ain't this what, ain't this what brothers are supposed to do?"
The blood between us, makes it all but true.

We saw that smoke rising over trees
And I swore, I swore, I swore,
That train was out for me.
So I held him tight and felt those tracks rumble underneath.
He swore, he swore if I didn't let go he would knock me off my feet,
And that's what he did.

Unwanted, but breathing.
In the next room, sleeping.
My mother, she's crying and my father's been drinking.
In our run down apartment, where the roof is still leaking.
He's cursing and cussing, it's just the whiskey talking.

I've got lots of memories like this one.
Of empty days and nights spent tired and lonesome.
When I think back to all of it,
Well it's all too much,
Well it's all too much when you're just a little kid.

My little brother, just a newborn baby.
In the image of my mother, she says he's a blessing.
But not to my father, oh how he hates him.
"An undeserving mistake." He calls him a burden.

I've got lots of memories like this one.
Of picking sides and picking fights between them.
When I think back to all of it,
Well it's all too much,
Well it's all too much when you're just a little kid.

When I wake up in the morning it all feels like a bad dream,
One that follows you and haunts you endlessly.
Yeah haunts me endlessly.

Broken and beaten from the abuse and the cheating,
The addiction, the lying and the promise of leaving.
While my old man was a bastard, I admired and loved him.
Us two kids, we were born in to a family, not a fortune.

Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can't stand the sight of yourself.

"Now that you're gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you."
You drink until you're sick.
"I trace the grooves in your stone."
Plot where you'll bury him,
The man that left you alone.

Climb those cemetery walls again;
Leave these flowers at your headstone.
Climb those cemetery walls again,
Every night; you can't stand the sight of yourself.

You drink until you're sick,
And feel the dew in the grass.
As the sun's coming up,
Watch a funeral pass.

"Now that you're gone, what am I to do?
But get lost in this bottle thinking of you."
You think to yourself,
"That should have been me."
Two in the family plot, but you wish it were three.

Bury him in the cold wet ground.
Familiar faces would have made him proud.
The military and the working man,
The history of the life he lived.

"Can you feel that soil covering your coffin?"
Can you feel?

So what are you going to do?
Be the hero that your father was?
So what are you going to do?

And you are your father's son.
Dear father, dear father.
Be the hero that your father was.
Be the man he made you to be.

The war-torn stories that he told you
You've got a hell of a lot to live up to.
An airborne man with a scar and wound,
"Never make a promise that you can't prove."

Dear father, dear father.

The way she looked at you, tears streaming down her face.
You felt the brush of her dress as she walked away.

And that's all it took, sat down to buy her a drink.
An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same.
And that's the way that it's been, years later she took your name.
Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her.

Another night at the Copper Coin.
Another night, another night.

And that's all it took, sat down to buy her a drink.
An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same.
And that's the way that it's been, years later she took your name.
Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her.

Tell me about the old days.
Another night at the Copper Coin.
Tell me about the old days.
Put the sun into the sea.

Because there ain't nothing like your smile,
Your legs and those eyes.

Tell me about the old days.

Because there ain't nothing like your smile,

And I will beg
And steal and borrow
To keep you safe for your whole life.

Hello, my dear
It's so nice to see you here
How long has it been?
Oh, it feels like years
But I'm sure it's just been days

Been walking around alone
Drunk and missing you at home
You know I'll never feel the same
Or ask another girl to take my name

Think I've been stopping by too much
Don't want you to get sick of me
On my way home from the Copper Coin
It's this or I jump into the sea

And I'll never forgive myself
For not being there to protect you
I should have been at home
Instead of out trying to forget you

Just one fight
And I'm out the door
What kind of man am I?
I swore I'd never leave your side

Hello, my dear
It's so hard to see you here
How long has it been
Since we put you in the ground?
Oh, it feels like days, but it's been years

Oh, and please don't call me baby

You cleaned the mess from my head

And I don't mind

No, I don't mind

Lets go walkin' on the boardwalk
Dip our feet into the sea
Lets find ourselves lost for hours
Until we find ourselves a drink

Lets talk that sun into setting
Just need the sound of your voice
Need that calming and the comfort
Something to drown out the noise

And I don't mind
If we take our time
'Cause I'm all yours
If you're all mine

Something I've been meanin' to tell you
About three years and a day
I'd very much like to get married
Maybe have kids and move away

'Cause there ain't nothing like your smile
Your legs and those eyes
I will beg and steal and borrow
To keep you safe your whole life

And I don't mind
If we take our time
'Cause I'm all yours
If you're all mine

"Where were you every night that I woke up alone?"
Cold sweat keeps you up.
"This ain't no kind of home."

"Come pick me up."

"Damn those boys at the bar,
Damn the way that you drink."
Cold sweat, sleepless nights,
When your hands start to shake.
"Damn that pier where you sit,
Damn your vengeance for him
There's no bringing him back,
Your father is buried and dead."

But you can't let go of that hero's death.
And you've been left with,
Left with his debt.

You couldn't fight for your country
And your mother is an addict.

"How dare you?"
"This ain't no kind of home."

"Come pick me up."

"Damn that man that you humor,
He only wants one thing from you.
Damn those looks that you give him.
Parlor tricks and I'm played for a fool."

"How dare you?"
"This ain't no kind of home."

You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The same chair as your old man
Your mother's worse than you think
Sunken eyes and a withering frame
The needle quiets the longing
That poison, it fills...; it fills her veins
(One by one, one by one)

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain't no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The longer you sit at the ocean
You lose more time than you think
Your blood runs cold
Wind biting under your coat
Pull it tight to your chest
Your mother is praying for death
Much more than you know

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain't no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

"You coward (you coward)
This is your fault
Our family
Has lost everything"


Look down at your hands and your lit cigarette
Put it to your lips and breathe it in
Everything starts to fade and your body is numb
And when you wake in the morning you're in the house all alone

"Dear God, what have you done?"
Those words ring loud in the back of your head.
That bottle lies in a thick, blood red.

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

"Dear God, where have you gone?"
Your brother is gone in the blink of an eye.
That January night, our father lays cold.
"Where are you going to go?
You're only seventeen years old."

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

Those cold steel tracks beneath your feet,
Those same rail ties where you dodged those trains.
When we were just two kids, it still feels the same;
That warm blood rush when the train comes.
(When the train comes)

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
"I will find you, and put that vice to your head.
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again."

As the waves crash, the clouds roll.

Sit on the dock waiting for the sun.
Wait for the coward but he never comes.
Pray for revenge on him.
Steam rises as the boats come in,
One by one (one by one).

You know she is gone,
You know there's no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.

When you come home to find her lying on the floor,
You're reminded of those sleepless nights
That will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Blue collar shipyard, any way to keep her alive.
Sun up to sun down,
Blistered hands and a parched mouth.

You know she is gone,
You know there's no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.

You're going to find him, and make him pay.
Stumble out to the bar.
"Take one more look at her,
And it will be the end of your days.
You low-life bookie, you don't scare me.

I ain't settling no debt,
I ain't saving no face.
One more drink then I'm gone
And then I'll drag you out of this place."

Put it down for the courage,
Your fists clench with the blood rush.
White knuckles when the hit lands,
Cold concrete and blurred vision.

Stumble home from the bar.
Stuttered steps home to your front door.
On the tip of your tongue, your remorse.
Shamed by the loss and defeat.
Shamed by your let down to her.
The same walk as that first night.
Now alone you know that this ain't right.
Better days and the promise you made,
Ain't no man supposed to walk out that way.

Her ring lies in the thick red,
Your tears swell, and the room spins.
"Dear God, what have I done?"


You left her, and he took her, he laid with her.
You bastard's son.

With the blackout
And the bloodstains,
Your teeth clench,
Then the pain comes.

Lost in your own head, but then a knock at the door.
Put down that drink, your steps creaking the floor.
Go and get the gun, distract yourself from death.
Back against the door, your hands are starting to sweat.
Slowly cock the gun, slowly move to the side,
Slowly turn the handle, slowly open it wide.
You catch a glimpse of his face. Your heart sinks in your chest;
Your hands start to shake because you know that it's him.
Just the coward and you standing silent, dead air.
So you pull him inside into your father's chair.
"Your mother is dead, all thanks to you.
Her addiction got worse after you left you damn fool.
What you did to our father, I promised you'd pay up.
I'm going to take your life, but it don't feel like enough."
Cold steel to his head, walk him to his death.

Walk him down past the white oak doors.
Walk him out past the boardwalk and your old shipyard.
Your pistol in his side, make him pay.
On the outskirts of town, pass the old quarry now.
Walk him down to those cold steel tracks.
You stumble drunk with the gun in his back.

"Now get down on your knees on the tracks where you shamed me.
But this time, the dodge ain't going to end so pretty.
Either a bullet or that train steaming just ahead
Is going to end your days. You coward little kid."

You sit and you stir, while he waits for his death.
You'll never forgive him, and you never did forget.
He'll never see the sun again.
Make him pay off his debt.
Stand on those tracks, cold steel under your feet,
Barrel to his temple. "Your rotting mother, you will soon re-meet,"
You whisper in his ear, feel his whole body shake.
In an instant he's got your arm, he's got your gun, you're held down by his weight.
You feel the cold steel above and below.
You feel your stomach tie in knots when the train whistle blows.
You feel the warm of the blood where the barrel digs in.
From your cheek to your mouth, you taste the sweat and the tin.
You don't cry, you don't beg. You've been waiting for this.
For the coward, or for death, just to see your wife again.
That train is so close, so loud and so clear.
Your hands stop shaking and it's all that you hear.
Just like father. "You took him.
If this is how it's going to be
I would rather die at the hands of my own family."

I hope this finds you well
A father lost and mother dear
The family that's kept me here
A hard lesson learned, and I've learned it well
How to lose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say
I'll never raise a hand to the ones I love ever again
You begged and you prayed
For your god and his grace
To keep you safe
To save you from me

My broken spirit and back
My calloused shaking hands
The ache I carry in them
Are my grief and skeletons
The weight you carried inside
A weight that ain't my bloodline
Blackout the sunrise
I count these burdens as mine
And still all you see is that bastard in me

Believing in hell
A father lost and mother dear
The family that I squandered here
A hard lesson learned, and I forgot it all
How to lose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say
I'll never raise a hand to the ones I love ever again
You begged and you prayed

He took my brother to the ocean floor

Bled out and failed him, he never would have done that to me

Can you hear those birds sing?

Means we're closer to shore
Means we're closer to home
Further from love and war
Further from what made sense
What we were born to do
What kept the blood in our veins
Keep my veins thin with booze

Kept my hand on my gun
And my gun by my side
Kept the moon in my thoughts
With the sun in my eyes

Kept my head hanging low
Kept my gun by my side
My brother's name in my head
And the tears from my eyes

Kept the blood in my veins
Kept the blood in my veins
Brother's name in my head
Kept the blood in my veins

Had me praying for death
For me and my friends
So we would never wake up
To our lovers again

Because every lover had lied
When they said we'd be fine
When they said in good faith
They would sleep alone every night

Hope to come home in one piece
With our boys by our side

Now we're ragged and the torn
Like the flags that we fly
Like the ones we lay down
On a coffin so clean

See those eyes staring back
The boys we used to be

Kept the blood in my veins
(I re-read the postcards you sent, wish the truth was a lie)
Kept the blood in my veins
(The waves on the hull, throw your words off the side)
Brother's name in my head
(The ship takes the deed and dying back home)
And the blood in my veins
(I want to sing to the depths, with the letters you wrote)

Kept the blood in my veins
Kept the blood in my veins
Brother's name in my head
And the blood in my veins

Kept the blood in my veins

Dear old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again
I'm giving in to my vices bottle in hand

Dear old friend
I think I'm slipping again
At the end of my rope
This pain, this pain in my head

I could use your sage old advice
Some words to calm me down
I ain't been sleeping much nights
With my girl sleeping all over town

Short list of my enemies
Since days I spent in the trench
But he ain't no man, he's a cheat
A coward staring down death

Dear old friend
In this letter I'll never send
I confess I'd kill them both where they stand

Dear old friend
You only get what you give
At the end of my rope
This pain, this pain in my head

I could use your sage old advice

Since days I spent in the trench
But he ain't no man, he's a cheat
A coward staring down death

My old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again

On the front lines
I watched as good men died
I left a piece of me in foreign country side
And in my own home, I'm a stranger now
I was a father once
Lies built on losing ground

On the front lines
Boys buried where they lie
I left a piece of me in foreign country side
And in my own home, I'm a stranger now

Lies built on losing ground

The words could hardly leave my mouth
"How did I make it out alive?"
I lose the same sleep every night

"How did I make it out alive?"

I got your letter today
And when I heard my name
My stomach sank to the floor
I can't take any more
I'm digging my own grave

And it read "Dear John"
I knew this day would come
I'm drinking every drop
Until the aching will stop
Until you pull that rig out of your arm

A wise man once told me
There wil be no relief
We will never be free
Of the horrible things
And the pain that we've seen

And that same man was told

"No matter where we may roam
You forget what you know of
That life you once lived
Because your home ain't never home"

I got your letter today

I quit believing in heaven
I found no savior in nothing

When I gave my brother a coffin

He was the air in my lungs
He was the blood in my veins
The reason I joined up
The man that I'll never be

A cigarette and a drink
To burn away my night
And keep the ache in my chest
And his candle burning bright

These words they fall on deaf ears
There is only guilt, death and grief
Your god forgot about us
He's just a thief and a cheat

A cigarette and a drink
To burn away my night
And keep the ache in my chest
And his candle burning bright

He was the air in my lungs
(He was the air in my lungs)
The man I will never be

Another day when the sun ain't shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on


To my demons
To every dying wish I've had of us leaving
This old ghost town
Still dragging us down
To pull you out of this hell you've been living in
With the needle
And every dying wish I've had that you would clean up
Your ups and let downs pulling me underground
With every tired lie you tell just to fill your arm

You thin your veins with the dirt
With the hurt
With the memories and the pain

Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

And I lost my faith in your god
In your word
In every promise that you break

Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

So I walk the same way home each night
To find that back-alley pusher and take his life
And I ain't ashamed for what I've done
I'll take an eye for an eye until every junkie is blind
The river bed holds the blood and the knife

And I ain't ashamed for what I've done
I took his eye as a prize
The man who laid with my wife
Lays at the bottom of that river where the sun never shines

Another day when the sun ain't shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on


Still holding on

Another day when the sun ain't shining

March. 1945 unwanted from his first breath.
A mother's blessing born, a father's burden worn.
The bright shine of the sunrise along the tile floor to the open door.
With blood on the streets she lay on the mattress.
Staring aimlessly.
Numb, dark and decayed
On the bathroom floor of their rundown apartment.
Scraping fingers on tile just to feel something.
Unwanted by a bastard father.
Unwanted, but through the hazel eyes of his mother.
She's praying for god to save her.
"Please save me." but when she needs him most, he doesn't answer.
Another rosary, another unanswered plea.
"Please take us away, please let us be safe.
Let everyone that sees me forget my face."
But all she gets is the drunk with his fists and that old devil look in his eye.
Him and Jack, that gambling debt, that old devil look in his eye.
And without warning he raises his hand to her and says,
"Your god can't hear you, not down here.
No one will save you because no one cares."
And with her newborn boy, they would cry until the early morning light.
It was the first of many, many sleepless nights.

That soap box song stuck in his head.
Burdens lie in graves past by.
He carries his weight. that anthem for the disenchanted rings loud in waves of grain.
Heavy hearted hymns heard in slums fade out on those country roads.
Hope burning in his lungs.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Sleeping under sky.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Days turn into nights.
Sleep sound, the sun's out.
Sleep long, sleep well.
Days pass, weeks pass.
Memories come flooding back,
He prays his mother's God has saved her soul.
That soap box song still in his head.
Miles lost to heat and rain.
He carries his weight.
That message for the misdirected rings true to this day.
Heavy hearted hymns sung in fields.
He stops along that country road to listen as they sing.
"Swing low, swing low chariot for me. Swing low, swing low. Pray my soul to keep."
Rest now, the sun's down. Rest long, rest well.
Swing low, swing low."
Redemption lies in an old farm house.

"There's no place for me."
A man of nowhere, a man of black heart from the dead end streets.
"Regret runs through me. I am no one, I am nothing, I am a man of defeat. What's left for me?"
Thought of those open roads, his mother praying all alone, that vagrant anthem and the field sung hymns, the cowardice forever following him.
"What's left for me? The world has turned it's back on me. There's no place for me."
A sullen walk to the chapel stairs.
"Regret runs through me."
A hard pull on that white oak door to face up those fears.
"What brings you here my son?"
"I've been a horrible man. I killed my father, I killed my brother, I left my mother in your God's hands."
"Clasp your hands and count your sins. Kneel at the pew until the sermon begins. No judgment cast down this day, will set you free. You are forgiven my son, you are blessed and redeemed. You've found absolution here son, but only from me."
"What's left for me?"
A sullen walk to the steeple top to look over the city.
He carves his name in that old brass bell, so when it rings he can hear it in hell.
One last look to that western sky, one last wish he could have changed his life.
"I ain't no wicked man."
He let his fleet slip from under him, unwanted.

It still looks the same here after all these years.
The junkies and the steamboat men, the sun never set on them here.
He walks to his rundown home, hell-bent to find his mother, but all that fear comes back when he is greeted by his brother.
"It's not the same here."
"Oh, i never thought you would come right to me. I've spent years on these docks just waiting after you left, we were left with nothing. Every day what you did ran through me. You selfish fuck. it's your fault, can't you see? Your addict mother is dead. now, are you happy? You're left with nothing. now. You'll pay your debt to me. You coward, cheating thief. Down at those long steel tracks, your life is my payback."
"I bet you wish you were dead."
They walk the rails with a gun to his head.
And so he lay on the ties, just waiting. those racing thoughts through his head came rushing.
He slips out from the weight of the elder.
The younger's fear once again toppled over.
And now it's his upper hand, he sees the steam overhead.
This will be the last the elder breathes again.
Roll on through, that train bearing down.
As it ended his days, he somehow knew it would always be this way.
So ends that cold heart's legacy.

Roll on through to the other side of town.
Passed the quarry, the river beds, over bridges and bunker sheds.
Roll on through to the pits and the rail car yard.
"This is where you prove your worth."
A brother's dare, that devil's smirk.
"Oh, this is the way it will always be."
A kid brother in the shadows of a cold heart's legacy.
"Oh, this is where we see who runs first. It's you and me and the train. The steel tracks and the dirt. Oh, you can never live up to me."
And so he stood trembling, waiting for smoke above the trees.
Roll on through. He could feel it rumbling, he could feel it beneath his feet. Roll on through.
"Closer now, hold your ground. steadfast, ignore the sound."
Everything went quiet just before the rush took over his head.
The pull and the push of the engine, think back with the coal and the steam.
The racing thoughts, the questions, the adolescent rivalry.
And with a nod from the elder, the younger's fear topples over.
Over rails and over timber. "That's no dodge, you fucking coward."
And the train rolls on. "Yellow-belly go home." and the train rolls on.

He awoke in a cold sweat to those old sounds of heartbreak.
His brother at his side screaming "This isn't your fight."
But that rush took over his head and he came to his mother's side.
And he found himself alone with that devil rambling.
"Oh, well the money's all gone and she can't pay the rent with that needle in her arm."
He clenched his fists.
"What did she ever do to you, but raise us by herself when you were too drunk to come through?"
He took a swing.
"That's some nerve you got kid."
"Yeah, well they'll put that on your tombstone as the last thing that you said. I never wanted to kill a man, like i want to kill you, man."
The years of pain boiled over, trading blows across the counter.
And when that devil was down he grabbed for his empty old friend Jack.
He caught his eye as he took his last breath and that vice went to his head again and again.
"Dear God, what have you done?" cried out his mother.
"That devil drunk was no father. Another name on a list for unpaid bookies and gambling debts."
That spiteful stare of his brother.
"I ain't no forgiver or forgetter. I'll make you pay for this when you least expect it."
He washed the blood from his hands, kissed his mother and stepped into cold night air.

"if you're always running, you ain't no kind of man. face up your fears kid, fight for what you take stock in. out here on rolling hills, there ain't no alibis. only sweat and dirt, only that open sky. if you take nothing more than these simple words, with your head held high kid, you will have your day. you can leave hardened, i won't think twice of it. if you got a battle back home, you got no reason to stay." out there on rolling hills, he thought of days back home. all the pain and hurt, his mother praying alone. sleep never came for him, no rest for wicked men. in those starless skies, the moon shined shame on him. he found redemption in pale saints that took him in. his grey eyes, hopefulness, that only youth can feel before life sours them. "where you from, where you been?" the boy would ask. he could never answer, it was the truth he lacked. "i'm from nowhere kid, i've been to hell and back. i'm a loner kid, i got no grace and no tact." he had nothing more than those simple words. he was a runner and a coward always losing his way. still no sleep for him. "i ain't no wicked man." there would be no night like this for him ever again. he would change his fate, he would mend the breaks. he left that night with parting words to lead his way. "don't you be like me." and so that moonlit sky shined praise down on him.

As a kid the summers seemed so long.
The dusk; a never ending song.
Too much, too young.
He'd never hear it again.
A walk through the dismal streets, the alleys where the junkies sleep.
Too much, too young.
"That will never be me."
Slow, hand in hand to the boardwalk's end.
His mother's words like the biting wind.
"Please don't leave me."
He'll never hear them again.
"Keep quiet, stay out of sight."
Her sunken eyes that used to burn so bright.
"Please don't leave me."
So he hid pressed against the wall, under stairs in the darkened hall.
The sound of heartbreak reminded him of home.
Shadows move slow across the floor, a minute seemed like a day or more.
The end of heartache when she opened the door.
The sights, sounds, smell of burnt out shame, pride, spite and love.
They all come here to die.
He sobs, "Please take me a away. Please mother bring us home safe on nameless streets the way we came."
Suddenly, she prayed for better days and for redemption.
Sullenly she prayed to keep from harm's way and for conviction.
But there's no forgiveness here.
No hope beyond that pier.
No way to get out now, not for her in this dead end town.
And that drunk is waiting up, him and jack and the empty cup.
"Where you been? What you on? Who'd you fuck?"
One more drink to toast good luck.
She gets a stiff hand from the old like the bourbon he's been drinking.
Black out.

He walks the streets collar up to the snowfall.
Holes in pockets and knees.
Sleeps in bar rooms and horse stalls.
But you can't stay too long in one place.
"Move along kid, we don't like your face."
Mother's hold children close out of fear.
Father's curse under breath as they sneer.
He walks the streets, years pass by with the snowfall.
Time is wasted in drink, days begging and lost souls.
Holds no merit in vagrants in boxcars.
Down in hell you best know who your friends are.
"Not so proud scrounging for your next meal. No alibis sold when with devils you deal. How does it feel to be all alone with no direction? Home is never home, it's just the place where you came from."
"Home is never home," writ on walls of the church and the hostels.
"Home is never home," said by martyrs and lost souls.
"Home is never home," said the prophet in plain clothes as he strummed his guitar.
And he screamed, and he sang:
"Well I've been tired because I don't sleep that well on trains.
Well i got ups and downs but days are all the same.
I've been low but it never gets me down.
Well I've been thrown out, I've been let down, I've been shamed.
Well I've had hardships, I've been stripped of pride and name.
I've been low but it never gets me down
And i spent drinkin' all the worry from my head
In days spent wonderin', wishin' I was dead.
If only i could muster the words out from my mouth.
I would sing.
Oh i would sing.
I'd take the next train out.
Cause I've been hopin' I've been prayin' there's some God.
So when i die I'm saved and found and I'm not lost.
Cause all he's done, all for me is take away the ones I love.
And i spent drinkin' all the worry from my head.
In days spent wonderin', wishin' Q was dead..
If only I could muster the words out from my mouth.
I would sing.
Oh, i would sing.
I'd take the next train out.
I'm gonna take it..."

He found himself waiting again.
Out at the crossroads, out on the lam.
This time not running, this time by right.
A road-side hitcher waits for headlights.
"The blues won't bring me down."
That pick-up truck stopped. "Where you headed, kid?"
"Back to the boardwalk coast to fix the wrong I did."
That old man would bring him just as far as he could.
His hellhound sniffing out for a trace of any good.
The hope he's chasing.
The blues he carried are dead and buried.

Hard rain fell. Chalk it up to a failure.
Push through the cold weather.
Racing heart, slow the beat, push through the defeat.
No one knows, just push through the deadbeats, junkies, liars and cutthroats.
The same walk, the same pier.
No one's going to remember him here.
"Just walk until you reach those long steel tracks."
That old familiar sting, the memories of rivalry.
Years passed and it's still here.
The same dirt, the same rails, the same fear.
And all the years of giving in rushed through his head again.
With no loss to match his gain, he rolled on to hop that train.
That rain fell hard.
Chalk the miles from his failure.
Trees sway with the weather.
Racing heart, slow the beat.
Every crossed town line is relief.
With no money and no name, state lines, borders rivers are all the same.
The city by dawn, a stranger with no history comes.
"Just rest your head where the sun sets. Fade out at sun down."

I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I watched you change

It's like you never had wings

To see like your eyes do

Where no one can see
New life break away

You make the water warm
You taste foreign
And I know you can see
The cord break away
'Cause tonight

(Still and breathless)
Just like always
(Still I want some more)
Mirrors sideways
(Who cares what's behind)
Just like always
(Still your passenger)

(The chrome buttons, buckles on
Leather surfaces
These and other
Lucky witnesses)
Now to calm me
(This time won't you please)
Drive faster

(Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger)

Drop these down
Then put them on me
Nice cool seats there
To cushion your knees
Now to calm me
(Take me around again)
Don't pull over
(This time won't you please)
Drive faster

(Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows
Down to catch my breath again
Go and go and don't just
Drive me home then back again)

Just like always

(Don't let me go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Take me to the end)

I'll stick you a little
Enough to take your oxygen away
Set you on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
And I'm with you alone
I'm so into this whore
Afraid I might lose her
So forget about me
'Cause I'll stick you

Pushed back to square
Now that you've kneed her
In the throat, well, there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders
Of all
Transpose
Or stop your life
It's what you do

Pushed back to square
Now that you need her
But you don't, so there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders
Of all
So transpose
Or stop your life
It's what you do
Transpose
Or stop your life
It's what you do

Pushed back to square

In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
Die City stresst mich!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!

Ich hab' die Augen weit geöffnet, immer auf der Hut wie 'n Dschungeltier.
Wenn Du den Mut verlierst, ist das herzlich dumm von Dir.
Denn in der City musst Du durch, Leute verstumpfen hier.
Jeder geht an Dir vorbei, undurchschaubar wie Dunkelbier.
Ich weiss nicht den Grund dafür, vielleicht sind zu viele hier.
Die meisten sind überfordert für 'n einfaches: Ick liebe Dir!
Hauptsache, die Welt ist connected über T-Online.
Emotionen werden kalt, werden härter als Betonstein!

Denn in der City, in der ich wohn', da stehen Betonblocks.
Smog burnt meine Nase, wenn ich vom Balkon glotz'.
Die Leute gehen, wissen nicht, wo die Bremse ist, scheissegal, ob Hamburg oder Los Angeles.
Ich bin verwirrt wie Al Bundy, wenn Frauen die Brüste wedeln.
Der Smog der City ist undurchschaubar wie Küstennebel.
An manchen Tagen brauch' ich 'n Krankenwagen.
In der City gibt es wenige, die auch mal Danke sagen.

In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
Die City stresst mich!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!

Ich setz' meinen Fuss vor die Tür, schwimm' im Strom, spür', ich bin gefangen im City-Syndrom.
Die meisten sind so rücksichtslos wie Klingonen.
Ich hab die neusten Tapes an Bord, wechsel' stetig meinen Standort, sag' ständig Hallo, doch krieg' wirklich keine Antwort.
Das City-Symtom: Es sagt keiner Hi. Leider bleibt in der Stadt für Guten Tag keine Zeit.
Menschen bist Du einerlei, sie laufen an Dir vorbei.
Überall und immerwieder der selbe Einheitsbrei.
Eigentlich komm' ich damit gar nicht klar. Ich war nicht da, als die das gebaut haben, als das noch alles Botanik war.
Hier wird zuviel gebaut, zuviel Lärm und fertige Typen.
Da werd' ich gleich wütend, wenn die mich nicht ehrlich begrüssen.
Bei so 'nem Style möchte man doch glatt 'ne Reise buchen, bei heftigem Dreck und Strichern, die nach Freiern suchen.
Und keiner wird den Leuten helfen, die im Siff liegen, denn leider wird das Ganze hier keiner in 'n Griff kriegen.

In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
Die City stresst mich!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!

Als ich hierher kam, hat es mir anfangs gefallen. Wenn ich heut' schlaf', träum' ich von Sandstrand mit Palmen.
Denn da draussen sind die Jobs, die Leute und Termine, muss immer daran denken, wie und wann ich was verdiene.
In Smogcity ist alles zugebaut, der falsche Platz, wenn ich 'ne ruhige Minute brauch'.
Da hilft kein Wimmern und für 'ne bessere Zeit beten, Du musst die City lieben lernen wie Bäcker Teig kneten.
Wenn ich mich in der Stadt in den hektischen Wahn stürze, dreh' ich durch wie 'ne elektrische Zahnbürste.
Ich muss mein Leben, die Zukunft und das Geld regeln. Was würde ich hergeben, könnt' ich einfach um die Welt segeln.
Deichkind Statt dessen muss ich mich vertragen mit den Psychopathen, die an meinen Nerven nagen wie abends die Küchenschaben.
An üblen Tagen kannst Du keinen Schritt machen wie im Bus Insassen, fühlst Dich wie Innercity-Kids im Schwitzkasten.

In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
Die City stresst mich!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
In der City stehen Betonblocks! Wir atmen Smog ein!
Die City stresst mich!

Album  Bitte ziehen sie durch
Heute ist der Tag, jetzt geht es endlich los
Sie erreichen Ihre Ziele. Denken Sie groß!
Ein bisschen Größenwahnsinn kann nicht schaden
Und auf einmal können Sie fliegen. Denken Sie groß!
Geben Sie nicht auf und leben Sie den Traum
Dafür muss man kein Genie sein. Denken Sie groß!
In jedem Menschen steckt ein Visionär
Setzen Sie die Energie frei

Ich geb' ihn' einen Tipp, denken Sie groß!
Was zweifeln Sie so, übernehmen Sie die Show
Mit dem richtigen Riecher sind Sie der Leader
Und spielen schon bald in der obersten Liga
Trinken Sie den Baikalsee auf Ex
Zum Frühstück Blattgold auf die Smacks
Starten Sie durch wie die Antonov
Denken Sie an Dollars und entfliehn' Sie dem Molloch
Denken Sie Trumptower, da steht er
Ich bau' ihn höher, zwei Kilometer
Flugzeugträger, Leasingrate
Bezahl ich mit der schwarzen Kreditkarte
Fahren Sie durch den Schlamm mit 'nem Monstertruck
Jagen Sie die Beute wie ein Raubtier
Scheffeln Sie Milliarden, darin können Sie baden
Gewinnen Sie jetzt genau hier!

Ich sitz' in meinem Privatjet und öffne mein Schiebedach
Flieg ne Riesenacht, hab' grad an Sie gedacht
Denken Sie groß wie Calmunds Appetit
So wie Baumgartner, wenn er in das All fliegt
In harten Zeiten muss man Leistung zeigen
Wie ein Schwertransport voll mit Platinscheiben
Hier geht es um höher, schneller, weiter
Kaufen Sie kein Weed, Mann, kaufen Sie Jamaica
Bauen Sie kein Reihenhaus, bauen Sie ein' Vorort
Und herrschen dort als glücklicher Warlord
Denken Sie groß wie der Benzinverbrauch
Von 'nem Containerschiff. Dann geht es bergauf
Wo bleibt Ihr Einsatz? Wo bleibt der Wille?
Lasern Sie die Welt, und dann weg mit der Brille
Sie müssen sich nur noch entscheiden
Wenn Sie bitte hier unterschreiben

Ich sehe tiefer in den Abgrund hinein
Den du in mein Leben geschnitten hast
Sehe nichts nur Zeiten
Die längst vergangen

An Tagen wie diesem
Möchte ich sterben
Scheiden und mitnehmen
Alles was wir zusammen erschaffen haben
Hinaus in eine andere Welt
In der Mensch einen neuen Wert besitzt

Wir leben in einer Welt ohne Grenzen
Und so steh ich hier und halte dein Herz in meiner Hand

Deine Augen starren aber können nichts sehen
Die Erde verschlingt den Leib
Nimmt ihn auf in ihren ewigen Lauf
Und verbrennt die letzten Reste

Das Morgenrot am Horizont
Zieht meinen Blick
Auf den Geist in dem deine Seele wohnt
Fliegend durch die brennende Luft

Jeder Mensch sollte dem anderen helfen, nur so verbessern wir die Welt. Wir sollten am Glück des anderen teilhaben und nicht einander verabscheuen.
Hass und Verachtung bringen uns niemals näher. Auf dieser Welt ist Platz genug für jeden und Mutter Erde ist reich genug, um jeden von uns Satt zu machen.
Das Leben kann ja so erfreulich und wunderbar sein, wir müssen es nur wieder zu leben lernen.
Die Habgier hat das Gute im Menschen verschüttet, und Missgunst hat die Seelen vergiftet und uns im Paradeschritt zu Verderb und Blutschuld geführt.
Wir haben die Geschwindigkeit entwickelt aber innerlich sind wir stehengeblieben. Wir lassen Maschinen für uns arbeiten, und sie denken auch für uns.
Die Klugheit hat uns hochmütig werden lassen und unser Wissen kalt und hart.
Wir sprechen zu viel und fühlen zu wenig, aber zuerst kommt die Menschlichkeit und dann erst die Maschine.
Vor Klugheit und Wissen, kommen Toleranz und Güte. Ohne Menschlichkeit und Nächstenliebe ist unser Dasein nicht lebenswert.

Tausend Flammen erhellen die Nacht
Geblendet vom Licht saug' ich auf diese Macht
Ich sprenge die Fesseln die mich noch halten
Und steige auf zu dir

Ein letztes Mal folge ich dir
Bald ist es vorbei

Erblicke diese Schönheit bevor du erblindest

Rieche diesen Duft bevor er verfliegt
Atme diese Luft bevor du erstickst
Lebe dieses Leben bevor du stirbst
Lebe dieses Leben bevor du stirbst

Meteorites will fall from the skies
And in their wake everything dies
The world around us will go its way
One day, one day

I'll wait, either way

Bodies turn into dust
Buildings into rust
The land gives in to the sea

Life floats into space
Scattered without a trace
And all you can think about is me

I'll wait for you
(I'll wait, I'll wait for you)
Buildings come crashing down
Fire is all around
I'll wait, I'll wait for you

Keep your head held up high
I'll be somewhere in the shapes that twist the sky
I know soon we will reunite
Your embrace will surely keep us alive

Flimmern, Flimmern
Irgendwann nach Sendeschluss Flimmern
Zwischen und nach Überdosen, Unanständigkeiten und Flimmern
Plötzlich der Morgenappell: Empörung aktivieren
Aufstehen, Aufstand, Anstand
Dass ein paar der hauptberuflichen Hülsenpacker
Zu einer klareren Sprache fanden
Zeigte einmal mehr ihre Ignoranz
Gegenüber dem richtigen Bildausschnitt

Der deutsche Planet bekennt, bedauert, appeliert
Lamentiert und applaudiert am liebsten unter sich
Podium? Leider schon vergeben
Doch wir hätten da noch "Tanzneger" oder "Imbissverkäufer"

Und dann fragt man sich dann doch:
Wer soll eigentlich wo raus? Raus aus wo oder rein wohin?
Rein und raus und raus wohin, wer soll eigentlich wo raus und rein wohin?

Flimmern, keine Gnade
Kurzgeschlossen Flimmern
Die besessene Maschine füttert Flimmern
Und Flimmern und Füttern
Alle schrien immer hektischer: "Es wird zu viel"
Und legten reichlich Kohlen nach und Panik setzte ein
Berauscht von dem Gefühl etwas gefühlt zu haben
Posaunten sie Pathos und entdeckten den Stolz
Und wechselten das Thema, wenn immer jemand schrie.

Dann zeigte die Flasche auf den prügelnden Minister
Die Hexenjagd der Milchgesichter
Wer in Dover dem Container lebendig entstieg
Unterschrieb noch vor Ort einen Plattenvertrag

Und dann fragt man sich dann doch:
Wer soll eigentlich wo rein? Rein nach wo und raus wohin?
Rein und raus und raus wohin, wer soll eigentlich wo raus und rein wohin?
Man fragt sich doch:
Wer soll eigentlich wo raus? Raus aus wo und rein wohin?
Raus und rein und rein und raus, da kennt sich heutzutage keiner mehr aus

Und dann war wieder alles normal real
Verrückte Kühe, Hunde, Lastwagenfahrer
Im toten Winkel marschierend vor dem Fernsehsessel
Der eingeborenen Bevölkerung

Und dann fragt man sich dann noch:
Wer soll eingentlich wo raus? Raus aus wo oder rein wohin?
Rein und raus, raus wohin? Wer soll eigentlich wo raus und rein wohin?

Was solln die Nazis raus aus Dütschland?
Was hätte das für ein Sinn?
Die Nazis können doch net naus, denn hier jehörn se hin

Die ganze Zeit, seit wir uns kennen
Hab ich nie daran gedacht
Was wird sein, wenns einmal kracht?
Was wird sein, wenn wir uns trennen?
Wird unsere Liebe dann zu Hass
Oder wars dann einfach das?
Denn Liebe geht auch mal vorbei
All die schöne Schwelgerei
Wenns so weit ist, hat einer ein Problem

Liebe wird zu Schmerz über Nacht
Weder du noch ich haben je darüber nachgedacht
Wir ließen es geschehn, da war kein Grund, uns vorzusehen
Doch Liebe wird zu Schmerz

Schmerz und Liebe liegen dicht beieinander
Wer hoch fliegt, der fällt auch tief, vielleicht warn wir zu naiv
Es tut mir Leid, ich wollte dir das nie antun
Doch nun ist es passiert, nun hab ich dein Herz halbiert
Der Preis scheint viel zu hoch zu sein
Den Schmerz hat man für sich allein
Doch glaube mir, das war es trotzdem wert

Liebe wird zu Schmerz über Nacht
Weder du noch ich haben je darüber nachgedacht
Wir ließen es geschehn, da war kein Grund, uns vorzusehen
Doch Liebe wird zu Schmerz

Ich möchte eine Welt, eine Welt
in der Würmer und Insekten endlich wieder schmecken.
Ich möchte eine Welt in der ich
aus einer Toilette trinken kann ohne Ausschlag zu kriegen.

Die Tagesschau ist nicht mein Fall,
nichts als Mord und Massensterben überall.
Die Hunde des Krieges wieder losgelassen,
wenn Schwestern und Brüder sich wieder hassen.

Wenn Bomben fallen, Terror regiert.
Und der Mensch im Allgemeinen,
zum Hass tendiert.

Das, was mir dazu einfällt,
für die Rettung dieser Welt -
Friedenspanzer.

Er schießt Liebe in dein Herz,
bringt den Frieden ohne Schmerz -
Friedenspanzer.
Friedenspanzer.

Er schießt mit Blumen statt Granaten.
Er trifft jeden auch die Harten.
Anstelle Giftgas gibt es Rosenduft.
Schwängert mit Weihrauch die beschmutzte Luft.

Er lässt uns niemals mehr allein.
Und auch du und ich und Alle...
werden seine Munition sein.

Das, was mir dazu einfällt,
für die Rettung dieser Welt -

Er schießt Liebe in dein Herz,
bringt den Frieden ohne Schmerz -

Wer näht das Ozonloch zu?
Pflanzt 'n neuen Regenwald im Nu?
Stoppt Hungersnöte mit der Tofukanone?
Erklärt die ganze Welt zur Antiwalfangzone?

Hier ist als Lösung wirklich nur noch eins gefragt...

Das, was mir dazu einfällt,

Er schießt Liebe in dein Herz,
bringt den Frieden ohne Schmerz -

Macht Schluss mit jeder Diktatur,

trägt Omas Einkaufstüten heim.

Mach die Augen zu und küss mich
Und dann sag, dass du mich liebst
Ich weiß genau, es ist nicht wahr
Doch ich spüre keinen Unterschied
Wenn du dich mir hingibst

Mach die Augen zu und küss mich
Mach mir ruhig etwas vor
Ich vergesse was passiert ist
Und ich hoffe und ich träume
Ich hätt' dich noch nicht verloren

Es ist mir total egal,
Ob du wirklich etwas fühlst
Tu was du willst

Mach die Augen zu und küss mich
Ist es auch das letzte Mal
Lass uns den Moment des Abschieds noch verzögern
Lass mich jetzt noch nicht allein mit meiner Qual

Mach die Augen zu und küss mich
Mach mir ruhig etwas vor
Wenn du willst kannst du dann gehen
Aber denk dran ohne dich,
Ohne dich bin ich verloren

Es ist mir absolut egal
Ob du nur noch mit mir spielst
Tu was du willst

Den ganzen Tag rennst du der Kohle hinterher
Den ganzen Tag arbeitest du von früh bis spät
Nur damit du mal 'nen eigenen Mercedes hast
Und ein eignes großes Haus mit großem Garten
Nur du gehst dabei vor die Hunde
Nur du gehst dabei zugrunde

Steh ich vor dem Spiegel, schau ich in Alltagssorgen rein
Und dann denk ich, ich wär so gern noch mal ein Kind
Ich wär so gern noch mal ein Kind

Früher warst du der, der du wirklich warst
Mit deinen Fragen, deinen Popeln, deiner Liebe, deiner Angst
Heute heißt es, so was macht man nicht, dazu bist du viel zu alt
Du bist jetzt erwachsen

Nur du gehst dabei vor die Hunde
Nur du gehst dabei zugrunde

Steh ich vor dem Spiegel, schau ich in Alltagssorgen rein
Und dann denk ich, ich wär so gern noch mal ein Kind
Ich wär so gern noch mal ein Kind

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south, London town

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
"We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"

These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms

Still enough
Although I know you're not begging
Still as the thoughts running through your mind
Still enough
Although I know you're not begging
Give me a reason to make you mine

I will devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you've brought
Meaning to my life

Had enough
Although I see you're not running
Still are the thoughts running through your mind
Dead to love
The path that you are now taking
Show me the reason to make you mine

I will devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you've brought
Meaning to my life

Run to where the smallest ray of light will never find you
Run to where you will not need to shield your eyes
Run away from all the soulless, heartless fiends who hound you
Run away and let your memories go blind

When I devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you've brought
Meaning to my life

Sensation washes over me, I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago, I don't remember
Tear a hole so I can see my devastation
Feelings from so long ago I don't remember

Holding on, to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

Blind your eyes to what you see, you can't embrace it
Leave it well enough alone and don't remember
Cut your pride and watch it bleed, you can't deny it
Pain you know you can't ignore I don't remember

Holding on, to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me

Sensation washes over me
I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago
I don't remember

I'm just holding on, to let them know

To hide behind I mask this time

And try to escape into me

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools," said I, "You do not know.
Silence, like a cancer, grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you.
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells, of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sounds of silence

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Into the abyss will I run

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go

Yes I am stricken and can't let you go

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Onetta there in the corner stands
And she wonders where she is.
And the rain still hurts,
Some people seem to have everything.
Nine a.m. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell.
And she's looking real pretty.
She's waiting for her clientele.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Twenty–eight years have come and gone.
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in.
They really seem to need her there.
It's a sacrifice working day–to–day
For little money, just tips for pay.
But it's worth it all
To hear them say that they care.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Already knows she's seen her bad times.
Already knows these are the good times.
She'll never sell out, she never will, not for a dollar bill.
She works hard...

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money,
So you better treat her right.

Die Dummheit feiert sein Comeback
Endlich darf man sich beschwer'n
Der Kopf aus Holz wär' gerne eisern
Und macht doch jeden Schwachsinn mit

Und kleine Geister haben zu viele Freunde

Die Lügen, das Schweigen
Der Stolz, der andere verletzt
Wenn das hier wirklich alles ist
Dann ohne mich

Der Dumme hängt die Flagge stets am Höchsten

I. Someone Like Him
I never wanted to become someone like him so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd
Never be someone like him

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed
My independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision
So secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know
That I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm
Missing out this time

As far as I could tell
There's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself
Could this be everything
Then all I swore
That I would never be was now
So suddenly
The only thing
I wanted
To become
To be someone just like him

II. Medicate (Awakening)

A Doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years
Where have I been
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

A higher dosage she prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot
A brief awakening

I feel the relapse
Can't break free
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

III. Full Circle



Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the Ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with Diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for Nightmare Cinema show me the way to get back home again

(Running forward, falling back)
Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up)
Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle with careful with
That axe Eugene Gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again

(Running forward, falling back)
Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up)
Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I've come full circle

IV. Intervals

 Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path

 Asking questions
Search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you

 Try to break through
Long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath

 Loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire

 Tortured insanity
A smothering hell
Try to escape but to no avail

 The calls of admirers
Who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more

 Innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madman's impulsive designs

 Step after step
We try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium

V. Razor's Edge

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge

A perfect sphere
Colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began

Die Musik ist lange aus
Die Band ist schon zu Haus
Nur ich sitze noch hier
Mit ein paar Freunden ein paar Bier

Es wird getrunken und gelacht
Und erzählt die ganze Nacht
Und ich lehn' mich kurz zurück
Und genieße still mein Glück

Das sind die Momente
Wo ich, wenn ich es könnte
Mir wünsche würde, dass sie nie vergehen

Liebe gute alte Zeit
Bleib ein bisschen stehen
Ruh' dich aus für eine Weile
Denn es ist grad' so schön
Lass uns hier und heute bleiben
Halt die Uhren alle an
Diesen Augenblick wollen wir die nächsten
100 Jahre lang

Wir haben uns lang nicht mehr gesehen
Schon fast ein halbes Jahr
Wir brauchten Zeit und die Entfernung
Und jetzt ist sie wieder da
Mit einem Koffer in der Hand
Und 'nem Lächeln im Gesicht
Und ich nehm' sie in die Arme
Und ich drück sie fest an mich

Das sind die Momente
Wo ich, wenn ich es könnte
Mir wünsche würde, dass sie nie vergehen

Liebe gute alte Zeit
Bleib ein bisschen stehen
Ruh' dich aus für eine Weile
Denn es ist grad' so schön
Lass uns hier und heute bleiben
Halt die Uhren alle an
Diesen Augenblick wollen wir die nächsten
100 Jahre lang

Ein unverhofftes Wiedersehen
Ein Lächeln im Vorübergehen
Ein Streit, der wieder beigelegt
'Ne Krankheit, die man übersteht
'Ne wunderbare Neuigkeit
Der Ausgleich in der Nachspielzeit
So viele Augenblicke gehen viel zu schnell vorbei

Liebe gute alte Zeit
Bleib ein bisschen stehen
Ruh' dich aus für eine Weile
Denn es ist grad' so schön
Lass uns hier und heute bleiben
Halt die Uhren alle an

Als ich morgens erwachte
Lange vor meiner Zeit
Sah ich zur Decke und dachte
Ich bin noch nicht bereit
Alle sagen ich müsste
Doch langsam wissen wies geht
Steh doch auf such dein Glück
Komm auf den Boden zurück
Sonst ist es einmal zu spät

Aber ich möchte fliegen
Ganz weit oben über'm Meer
Und dann sehe ich all die Scheiße
All die Scheiße hier unten gar nicht mehr

Was für ein grausamer Morgen
Mit so viel Bosheit im Blick
Schon wieder Zweifel und Sorgen
Und die Angst im Genick
Was soll denn nur aus mir werden
Ich hab nicht die geringste Idee
Und ich hör schon den Chor
Vor meinem inneren Ohr
Krieg deinen Arsch hoch und geh

Aber ich möchte fliegen
Ganz weit oben über'm Meer
Und dann sehe ich all die Scheiße
All die Scheiße hier unten gar nicht mehr

Was soll denn hier noch passieren
Wo die Tage ihre Namen verlieren
Wo die Gesichter verschwimmen
Und die Sprechblasen platzen wie Träume
Wie konnte das nur geschehen
Ich hab doch immer nach vorne gesehen
Ich dachte alles ist möglich
Und ich finde ganz sicher den Weg

Aber ich möchte fliegen
Ganz weit oben über'm Meer
Und dann sehe ich all die Scheiße
All die Scheiße hier unten gar nicht mehr

Und ich fange an zu rennen
Und ich bleibe nicht mehr stehen
Denn ich kann die ganze Scheiße
Die ganze Scheiße hier unten nicht mehr sehen

Aber ich möchte fliegen
Ganz weit oben über'm Meer

Jedesmal kurz vor der Wahl da werden Stimmen laut
Was zu tun ist für das Bürgerwohl im Land
Wenn wir könnten wie wir wollten würden wir und überhaupt
Der Aufschwung geht jetzt los und zwar rasant

Doch es gibt viele die euch heute nicht mehr glauben
Eure Versprechen haltet ihr ja doch nicht ein
Und wir werden euch das bald nicht mehr erlauben
Auf eure Phrasen fällt jetzt keiner länger rein

Auge um Auge - Zahn um Zahn
Nur immer alles hinzunehmen, nein wir denken nicht daran
Baut nur weiter euer Häuschen Stein auf Stein
Wir werden kommen und wir reißen es wieder ein

Es heißt wir sollen uns gedulden denn der Staat hat zu viel Schulden
Wir müssen auf ein neues Morgen bauen
Doch alles was wir auch erreichen nehmen immer nur die gleichen
Ihre Zukunft die erleben wir wohl kaum

Doch da sind viele die euch heute nicht mehr trauen
Die nicht glauben an ein Glück in fünfzig Jahren
Die nicht mehr mit an eurerm Häuschen bauen
Die jetzt eigene und bessere Wege fahren

Auge um Auge - Zahn um Zahn
Nur immer alles hinzunehmen, nein wir denken nicht daran
Baut nur weiter euer Häuschen Stein auf Stein
Wir werden kommen und wir reißen es wieder ein

Es ist noch lange nicht so weit
Doch es wird allerhöchste Zeit
Dass wir uns unserer Macht besinnen
Ein neues Zeitalter beginnen
Dann heißt es Bühne frei
Licht an und eine Chance für Jedermann
Wir sind die Stars in diesem Stück
Und gehen keinen Schritt zurück

Auge um Auge - Zahn um Zahn
Nur immer alles hinzunehmen, nein wir denken nicht daran
Baut nur weiter euer Häuschen Stein auf Stein
Wir werden kommen und wir reißen es wieder ein

Auge um Auge - Zahn um Zahn
Nur immer alles hinzunehmen, nein wir denken nicht daran
Baut nur weiter euer Häuschen Stein auf Stein
Wir werden kommen und wir reißen es wieder ein

Eine Armee die wünsche ich mir
Von der guten Fee
Eine Armee die auf mich hört
Auf jeden kleinen Befehl
Eine Armee die losmarschiert
Wenn die Stunde naht
Für alles was uns wichtig war
An einem neuen Tag

Ihr wart bereit und darum seid ihr mit dabei
Am nächsten Morgen sind wir frei, endlich frei!!

Eine Justiz, die wünsche ich mir
Von der guten Fee
Eine Justiz die auf mich hört
Auf jeden kleinen Befehl
Im Namen der Gerechtigkeit
Wird Recht neu definiert
Jetzt ist es die andere Seite
Die dabei verliert

Ihr wart bereit und darum seid ihr mit dabei
Am nächsten Morgen sind wir frei, endlich frei!!

Wir können ja alle friedlich sein
Doch vor dem Frieden kommt der Krieg
Wir werden alle friedlich sein
Später, viel später nach dem Sieg

Und ganz am Ende wünsch ich mir
Von der guten Fee
Die Weisheit unser Pläne wirklich zu verstehen

Besser zu sein als der Rest der Welt
Unser Regime wird wunderbar
Für jeden ist das gleiche da
Unsere Herrschaft ist das Paradies

Der Kutter, er fuhr durch den Sturm
Die Sicht sie war gleich null
Die Männer wollten nur nach Haus
Die Netze waren voll
Ein warmes Süppchen auf dem Herd
War alles was noch zählt
Doch die Heimat sahen sie nie...

Denn der Tod kam aus der See...

Ghostsharks in the Sea!!

Der junge Jim, grad 15 Jahr
Es war die erste Fahrt
Würde er nochmal die Mutter sehen
Sie hatte ihn gewarnt...
Den Vater holte auch die See
Tot war er grad ein Jahr
Ein Kreuz am Strand war alles
Was von ihm geblieben war

Planken splittern, Knochen brechen, es geht blutig her
Todesschrei in der Nacht und rot färbt sich das Meer
Sie lassen alle Hoffnung fahren, die See würde ihr Grab
Der Kutter bäumt sich noch mal auf...
Und abwärts geht die Fahrt...

Keine Angst vor Morgen, die Zukunft hat ihren Preis
Die Steine die wir warfen, verschwanden in der Zeit
Chaos gegen Ordnung, Böse gegen Gut
Alles was wir brauchen ist ein wenig Mut!

Immer wieder kotzt es mich an
Immer wieder glaube ich nicht daran
Dass sich irgend etwas ändern wird
Solange das System regiert
Immer wieder glaube ich nicht daran

Die Parolen sind gedroschen
Alle Lieder längst gespielt
Eigentlich war uns immer klar
Dass die Welt uns stets betrügt

Feuer gegen Wasser, Wahrheit gegen Heuchelei
Die Zeit hat uns verändert, doch der Kampf ist nie vorbei!

Widerstand braucht Phantasie,
UNd darum schafft ihr uns nie
Weil wir einfach besser sind
Helden in der Nacht

Und wir kämpfen, weil wir sind:
Weil wir bessere Menschen sind!!
Längst vergessen und vorbei

Doch: Am Ende lacht der Hai

Ein Flüstern wird zum Aufschrei,
Ein Satz zum Todesmarsch,
Die Abbildung der Realität
Verblaßt an jenem Tag
Der Jäger und das Opfer
Vereint im Totentanz,
Anarchie bedeutet,
Dass du dennoch lachen kannst!!

die seuche heißt verdummung.
sie liegt schwer auf dem land.
keine platz für schillers glocke
kein platz für den verstand

die gespräche werden schlauer
und herbstlaub wird verbrannt.

REF.:jetzt holen wir uns die welt zurück
wir weichen nicht, nicht ein kleines stück
jetzt holen wir uns die zeit zurück
wir gehen nicht, kein schritt zurück!!

erkenntnis führt zur wahrheit
und wahrheit zu der pflicht
den widerstand zu leben
im guten geht es nich.

die einen tragen masken
und atmen kichergas
die anderen grillen würstchen

Hey Käpt'n Hey Ho !!

Die Jahre zogen vorüber,
sein Leben war nicht schön.
Er versuchte einfach alles,
um der Moloch zu entgehen

Er log, betrog und schleimte,
es war ein langer Kampf,
Doch hinter seinem Rücken,
die Maschinen unter Dampf !

Ja, komm !!

Fazit: Am Ende seiner Tage,
da wird ihm plötzlich klar.
daß er sein ganzes Leben,

Auf der letzten großen Reise
Fliegt die Kugel wirklich leise
Bis sie dann vor'm Auge steht
Und alles in Blutrausch vergeht...

Willst du, ja sag mir, willst du
Daß ich weiter flieg?

Linkes Auge, rechtes Auge
Wie soll es jetzt weiter gehen?
Alle Wege in deinen Körper
Sind für mich so wunderschön!

Willst du, ja sag mir, willst du
Daß ich weiter flieg?

7, 8, 9 Millimeter
Trifft den alten Miesenpeter
Ins Gesicht und in das Kreuz
Keiner hat es je bereut

Wie ein Vogel, wie ein Flugzeug
Fliegt die Kugel durch die Luft
Immer schneller, immer heller
Morgendlicher Frühlingsduft...

Wie ein Geier, wie ein Reiher
Immer weiter mit Überschall
Und wir warten auf die Stille
Nach dem letzten Knall!

Auf der Suche nach der Lösung
für die braune Flut
habe ich von Lichterketten
und von Demos längst genug.
Von subventionierten Jugendclubs,
ihrem Urlaub an der See.
Da liegt die Dummheit in der Sonne...
auf daß der Hass vergeht

Ich glaube nicht, das das die Lösung ist.
Ich glaube nicht das dadurch die Mauer in den Köpfen bricht.

Meica macht das Würstchen,
und Dummheit den Faschist.
Wir brauchen eine Lösung,
die für euch endgültig ist.

Alte Kampfstrukturen,
in neuem Licht gesehen.
Terror für den Frieden,
Lektionen zum Verstehen

Kann es denn sein,daß das die Lösung ist,
kann es denn sein das dadurch der Osten wieder sicher wird ?

REF: Wo ist die RAF wenn man sie braucht ??

Ich will schwarze Wagen,
die langsam durch die Städte fahren
Gezielte Todesschüsse
eine Seuche kein Erbarmen

Ich glaube jetzt, daß das die Lösung ist .
Ich glaube jetzt daß ein Stahlgeschoß jede Dummheit bricht.

So ein Tag, der kommt nie wieder
Die Revolution seit gestern erfolgreich vorüber
Abgeurteilt wurde die deutsche Bank
Hinter Gittern sitzt die CDU
Und mit ihr das halbe Land!!

Für die Freiheit, die Gerechtigkeit
Und mein ganz persönliches Wohlbefinden
Für die Freiheit, die Gerechtigkeit
Und ein billiges Rachegefühl...

...bekommt ihr einen "fairen Prozess"
Wir machen mit euch kurzen Prozess
Kein Geld und kein Anwalt holt euch da jetzt raus
Und ganz am Ende macht der Letzte
Die Lichter aus!!

Die Luxussteuer geht auf 100 Prozent
Die Grenzen sind geschlossen
Und das Kapital verschenkt
Der Dicke wird jetzt reden die Spender werden genannt
Wir haben unser Mittel, das hat er schnell erkannt!!

Für die Freiheit, die Gerechtigkeit
Und mein ganz persönliches Wohlbefinden

Und ganz am Ende macht der Letzte

Die Gesetze werden geändert
In der Stunde nach dem Sieg
Während die Opposition
Noch glücklich lächelnd schlief
Und die FDP noch rasch das Land verließ...

Ich wollte nie Tierhändler sein, ich wollte immer ein Holzfäller werden...
Jaaa ein Holzfäller, hüpfen von Baum zu Baum während sie die Flüsse in British Kolumbien hinunterschwimmen. Der riesige Rotholzbaum, die erstaunliche Lärche, die veredelte Weißtanne und die mächtige Kiefer.
Der Duft von frischen gefällten Brettern, das zerbersten der Bäume. Und neben mir ein liebes Mädchen und wir singen, singen, singen.

Ich bin Holzfäller und mir geht's gut,
am Tag packt mich die Arbeitswut.

Er ist Holzfäller und ihm geht's gut,
am Tag packt ihn die Arbeitswut.

Ich fäll den Baum
und ess mein Brot,
geh auch mal aufs WC.
Am Mittwoch geh ich bummeln
und nehm Gebäck zum Tee.

Er fällt den Baum
und ißt sein Brot,
geht auch mal aufs WC.
Am Mittwoch geht er bummeln

Ich fäll den Baum
und spring herum,
an Blümchen hab ich Spaß.
Ich trag gern Frauenfummel
und häng herum in Bars.

Ich fäll den Baum,
trag Stöckelschuh,
Strapse und BH.
Ich wär so gern ein Mädel,
genau wie mein Papa.

Ihre Tarnung ist perfekt,

sie werden immer zu dir stehn',
du merkst nicht es sind Feinde,

Nein, noch ist es nicht zu spät,
fallt nicht auf sie 'rein,
nein, noch ist es nicht zu spät,
Ihr müsst halt schlauer sein!

Ref.: Es sind Feinde unter uns,
Es sind Spione unter uns,
Es sind Feinde unter uns,
Es sind Nazis unter uns.

Es sind linke Faschisten,
hinter Ihren Masken steht nur
die Gier nach Macht,

die sie selbst zu Göttern macht

Nein, noch ist es nicht zu spät ...;

lacht nicht mehr in Disneyland
sie frisst jetzt kleine Kinder
und trägt ein Leichenhemd

Draußen ist es dunkel und es wird nie mehr hell,
die Zeit ist abgelaufen, für dich, für mich, für jeden hier ...

Was gut war ist jetzt böse,
was schwarz war ist jetzt weiß,

verlöscht in der Dunkelheit
Das ist nicht das Land, in dem man Freude kennt,
Das ist nicht die Zeit, in der ich Blumen schenk ...

1. Zu viele haben sich entschuldigt,
für dass, was Wahrheit ist,
Zu viele sind zu Kreuze gekrochen,
bis nichts mehr übrig ist.

2. Zu viele haben Angst bekommen,
vor der Allmacht des Systems,
Sie sitzen jetzt verschreckt zu Hause,
doch wir werden weiterziehen.

Ja, wir sind radikal,
Doch wir folgen keinen Helden,
wir kennen unseren Weg.
Ja, wir sind Radikal,

Neue Ideen müssen her,
Schlagt sie da, wo ihr sie wirklich trefft,
tief in ihrem korrupten Herz.

I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You'd never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

I met this girl late last year
She said "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love

Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oh (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside

Ooh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not he end
I can't work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you're my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

A mess of this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping it stops
And though I've only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you're my road walking me home
Home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I've loved my lover
For how long I've loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I've loved my lover
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I've loved my lover
Now now
For how long, long I've loved my lover

Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you,
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing "We Found Love" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling

And should this be the last thing I see

Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

Ich wache auf schau zum Fenster und die Sonne scheint.
Ich mag es gern wenn das Wetter mit mir gut es meint.
Mach mir nen Kaffe, rauch ne Kippe, fühl mich Einwandfrei.
So muss das sein.

Seh vom Balkon aus wie die Leute schnell vorüber ziehn.
In meinem Kopf tummeln sich massig schöne Melodien.
Die Leute wolln zur Arbeit doch das ist mir einerlei.
Ich fühl mich frei.

(Das ist die richtige Einstellung)
Genieß die Sonne lehne mich zurück, noch nen Stück.
Ich lebe nur für den Moment für diesen Augenblick.
Es tut so gut hier zu sitzen ich muss gar nichts tun.
Ausser vom müßig gehen auszuruhn.

Die Sonne geht ich fühl mich frisch und gehe aus dem Haus.
Das Leben rockt drum gehe ich fast jeden Abend aus.
Treff öfter Leute in der Kneipe und wir trinken Bier.
Wie steht's mit dir?

Hast du ne feste Arbeit oder was ist dein Problem?
Dann empfehle ich dir einmal zum Arzt zu geh'n.
Nen gelben Schein bekommt man schnell dann kannst du leben fett.
Sympthome findest du im Internet!

Lass mich in ruh ich will dich nich mehr sehn
Die Zeit war lang und es muss ohne mich weitergehn
Es ist vorbei und ich weiß das so genau wie du
Auch wenn es schwer ist, stop hier sonst find ich keine Ruh
Lösch meine Nummer denn ich will dich nich mehr hörn
Und die Frage wann du anrufst soll mich nich mehr störn
Es ist jetzt Schluss mit dem ganzen hin und her
Und wenn du noch mal wieder kommst will ich nich mehr

Ich will nich mehr die ganze Zeit
Will nich mehr wisssen obs dir schlecht geht tut mir leid
Will nich mehr wissen was du machst und was du tust
Dir nichts von Glück erzähln und auch nicht von frust
Will dich am besten nur vergessen und dich lassen
Und bis das klappt werd ich versuchen dich zu hassen

Das Onkelz-Shirt ist kein Problem,
Ich hab selbst Punks so eins tragen sehn,
Unpolitisch sein, nach rechts schieln,
du kannst ja immer noch im Conne spielen.
Oh Yeah
"Schwul" als Schimpfwort, schon OK,
Es stört mich halt, wenn ich die Emos seh.
In Clubs feiern, grölen, Beifall klatschen
Und im Getümmel einen Arsch betatschen.
Yeah
Du musst dich doch nicht gleich beschwern,
Betrunken kann ich schon mal aggro werden.
Bleib doch mal locker, stell dich nicht so an!
Bist du ne Maus oder ein Mann?
Ein freies Land, in dem wir leben,
es muss auch Solche und Solche geben!
Muss tolerant sein dann und wann.
Doch eure Toleranz kotzt mich an!

Eure Toleranz kotzt mich an!

Ich kann das schon verstehn,
Er ist halt arbeitslos und ohne Perspektive
Geht er gerne mal auf Schwarze los.
Man muss sich kümmern, man muss das akzeptiern,
Mit so viel Krise kann man schon einmal den Kopf verliern
Gib ihm etwas, das bleibt, ein bisschen Sicherheit.
Nen Jugendclub, in dem er dann auch mal "Heil Hitler" schreit.
Muss tolerant sein dann und wann.
Eure Toleranz kotzt mich an!

Verständnis zeigen
Sich reinversetzen
Tolerant sein
Schwere Kindheit
Akzeptierende Jugendarbeit
Mangelnde Perspektive
Akzeptier sie doch einfach!

Plötzlich war alles anders als zuvor -
Auch Gefühle verändern sich.
Hatten einfach unsere Leichtigkeit verloren
Ich weiß, das verstehst du nicht.
Die Zeit ging weiter, alles muss sich verändern,
Auch die Gefühle zu dir, ich kann daran nichts mehr ändern.
Und jetzt steh ich vor dir und ich frage dich:
WAS WAS WAS

Was willst du wissen, was soll ich sagen
Weiß keine Antwort auf deine Fragen
Viele Probleme und ständig Plagen
Und keine Lösung in diesen Tagen...
Du willst es wissen, ich kann's nicht sagen
Du bleibst alleine mit deinen Fragen
Können wir uns trotzdem wieder vertragen?
Denn was soll bleiben? ich soll nicht klagen...

Schaust mich verständnislos an und erzählst mir dann
Dass du mich nie wieder sehen willst.
Ich denke insgeheim "NEIN!", gehe doch darauf ein,
Auch wenn ich eigentlich was Anderes will!
Wenn es so ist, muss ich mich damit abfinden
Auch wenn's total scheiße klingt, du hast dafür deine Gründe
Ich hatte mir halt gewünscht, dass bei uns dann am Ende
'ne Freundschaft bleibt.

Was willst du wissen, was soll ich sagen
Weiß keine Antwort auf deine Fragen
Viele Probleme und ständig Plagen
Und keine Lösung in diesen Tagen
Du willst es wissen, ich kann's nicht sagen
Du bleibst alleine mit deinen Fragen
Können wir uns trotzdem wieder vertragen?
Denn was soll bleiben? ich soll nicht klagen...

Deutschland ist ein Schurkenstaat
Kommt alle auf die Straße
Sofern ihr nicht schon draußen seid
wo seid ihr denn gerade?

Wir haben die Transparente mit
Doch leider fehlen die Leute
Wo die bloß wieder alle sind?
Ach, Deutschland spielt ja heute

Womöglich ist es ein Freundschaftspiel
Am Ende noch mit China
Am Anfang gibs das deutsche Lied und Nationales Fieber
Man ist jetzt wieder stolz auf sich
Denn Flagge zeigt man lieber
Solang man nicht dagegen ist
Hauptsache ihr seid Sieger

Drehen wir erstmal die Bässe auf
Gehen dann mit Egotronic aus und

Sieh wie meine Huefte kreist

Es gibt nichts was mich noch haelt,
Gruesse an den Rest der Welt
Fehlt der Party dann die Power
Gehts ab zur Afterhour

Ich wache auf und schau ins Netz. Cops haben ein Mann gehetzt, festgenommen und verprügelt und dann einfach ausgesetzt. Wenn Bullen gegen Immigranten toben, folgen die Herren in schwarzen Roben und trotz Zeugen freizusprechen, wird das Opfer abgeschoben.

Ich frag mich manchmal, bin ich denn der Einzige, den das schockiert. Ich frage mich wo bleibt der Aufschrei und das mal etwas passiert. Wo sind die ganzen guten Menschen, die sich sonst scheren um jeden Scheiß, stets Bio kaufen und Müll trennen, anstatt nen Stein zu schmeißen.

I turn the light on, and see your pretty face
I turn the light off, wishing that I could free space
I turn away, and know you're never far away from me
So I stay for another day

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

I learn to run off so I can keep the pace
And never a moment goes by I wouldn't trade for your embrace
Skies of gray, I know you're never far away from me
And I stay for another day

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

Who will measure the dimensions of antumnos?
Who can tell the gauge of its veil?
Who can manifest the size of its maw?
And infer the value of its stones?

Yet the glowing wick will not be quenched
The sown fire will never die

What is
What ever was
What ever is to come
What would
What ever should
It will remain as it never was

Eternity's past was repeated in time
The eternal knot will be unbroken
Whence comes the motion in this picture?
Where does the moment go when it steals away?
Who will pen the pages of time?
Who will be the audience when the curtain rises?

Where do we go. Question mark.
What have we become. Question mark.
Whither went what was. Question mark.
Shall there ever be dawn. Question mark.
Did we ever change?

While the noose is tightening
You still sit here on your fleeting throne
So busy with your own little feuds
And your own blinker crowns

But we all are Gauls
And we are free at least by now
So take the fucking plunge
Rise and unite

Arise
United we'll stand

This is V for vengeance
This is V for vehemence
This is V for victory
This is V for Vercingetorix

Let them feel the Gaulish violence
Impetuous furor
The bite of our blades
Let them see our freedom's ensign
Let us raise our clenched fists in pride

What benefit will it be
To save your crowns but forfeit your freedom at last?
We are one folk and we can make a stand
So lay down your crowns now
Rise and unite

Bestir
Wake up
As one, we'll prevail

This is V for verdict
This is V for valour
This is V for venture
This is revolt
This is kingdom come undone

We set forth, a retinue with steed and cart
So we roved the land stealthily
We sallied out to find new shores
As the passage led

Set sail, ye hearts into the sea of hope
The druid blessed this mount foreseen
We grudged no pains, we faced distress
Yet a glowing wick kindles fire...

Alike, a liminal place, a dormant beacon we faced
The haven foretold a fortress of ages to come
At the rise of a new dawn, woke the daughter of the sun
Wafted on black wings, vastly soaring boding skies

We followed the rites of old
As we took out the ordained new land
We held our breath as the skies got black
And a storm arose, a swarm of crows

Lo and behold! The black birds branched out
A circle wide in the riven skies
They lined the nemeton of the fulgent hill
And again, and again, and again the presage witnessed

Adiantunne ni exverti
Adiantunne ni nappisetu

Curtain's up for this lurid age
Clear the ring for oppression and greed
Welcome to this wasteland
Of blight and havoc
Once known as my home

Deleting fulfilled
Erasing procedure done
Cleansing complete
It's done, my friend
It's over and done

There was nothing left
But the smell of salassian blood
Nil and nothing left
But the braying void in our homes

I never forgot the eyes of the kids
Wrested from their moms
To be sold into slavery
I still can hear
The cries of the raped
And the bellow of the flames
The hymn of absurd death

Heed the chronicles
Of lucrative genocide
The annals of effaced tribes
Pages written in blood

Ave Caesar Augustus
It's done, my friend
It's over and done

Where ere thou hast been,
Here or in yon world manifest,
Canst thou tell
What is, or what was or what is to come?
No thing shall last
And there are things
That shall never change.
History is written in blood,
Yet are battles really lost
On the battlefields?
Canst thou tell me whence thou comest
And where thou goest
And what is, or what was, or what is to come?
For everything remains as it never was.

I am the mystery
And I am the bringer of moonless night
I bear the wisdom arcane
I, harbringer from the burrowed isle

Once you break forth
Harken the flap of my wings

I haunt your fears
Though you don't know of my duty
To lead your path
Because I'll take you home to rest
In my black wings, enfolding you

I am the icon sublime
The guide of the voyage clandestine
I sing the verses bewailed
I, torch of the radiant way

Once you step out
Hearken the strokes of my wings
Once you will leave your cocoon
I will be there

I haunt your fears
Though you don't know of my duty
To lead your path
Because I'll take you home to rest
In my black wings, enfolding you

And death will smile his barefaced smile
Initiating your final anguish
It is not before my arrival
That you will be led to feel
The natural serenity of leaving this world...
Hear my wings caressing the wind!
Hear my cry...

I haunt your fears
Though you don't know of my duty
To lead your path
Because I'll take you home to rest
In my black wings enfolding you

Glowing and blazing in the wind of times
Ever lit, searching and fathoming
The fire's arcane consuming flames
Sparks to imbue our very souls

Pervading the very breath of life
Flickering from the depths of eternity

Never asleep, never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear the sempiternal embers
Never profaned, never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit, never faint
The sempiternal embers

The essence of being, the form of existance
Forever inflamed with passion, heart of hearts
Burning so bright, yet clandestine

Gleaming in the lair of the powers to be
The four mighty ones the high kings concealed

Giving birth to the glimmer within
Incessantly fostering the flames...

Glowing and blazing in the wind of times
Ever lit, searching and fathoming
Sparks to imbue our very souls

And it came to pass in those leaden days
That a plain, poor man got sick of his yoke of condemned soil
And a foreign empire's hungry purse
Time to replace pitchfork with sword
And sound the anthem of sheer rebellion

Enough
Once too often
Enough is enough

We strive not for war
We just crave to have our home
We just seek to have our rights
That our fathers used to have

But we tasted the grime and blood
We tasted the essence of ashes

A glowing spark
Rising up from blazing flames
To lead the forlorn and wroth
The epitome of hope and freedom
A daring venture
A frenetic attempt
When Amandus was slain
The Bagaudae still sang

Sprinkled by the trappings
Of words that make the outlines
Blur on the showplace of made history
The Folk is willed
To parrot the dished up tale
The lure of a higher meaning

Cheat you had to create
An enemy stereotype
To receive your absolution
A frothy poor excuse for your foray
To disengage from the deeps
Of your encumbrance

Behold
All our gold
Thousandfold
Bereave me!
Declined
Truths ensign
Forever mine!
Bereave me!

March in with ten legions
Whilst the crucial weapon's not the pillum
But the feather held in your hand
Penned in blood
Your tall-tales rule the forum
Altering it into the battlefield

I, the spectral guise
Evoking these baring fears
Pestering your conscript fathers
I smile at my demise and while I die
I cherish the roots of my perseverance

"Fear"

I am a fair, pretty girl
Full of virtue and youthfulness
The forest's flowers and songs I love

Hey, pretty young girl
What are you doing in the forest alone
So far from all beings?
Hey, pretty young girl
What are you doing in the forest alone?

Hey, handsome boy, come here!
Let us pick some flowers
in this forest together!

Now only the deep pond awaits me
Now only the deep pond awaits me

I am not a boy, I am the bad wolf
In the woods I hunt
Hunt for the flower of your youth

Well, wolf, let us play a game
Let us dance a joyful dance
Let us sing decent songs!

I am not a boy, I am the bad wolf
In the woods I hunt

I don't like children's games
I like playing sinister wolf games
In the depths of the forest, with you

Now only the deep pond awaits me
Now only the deep pond awaits me
Now only the deep pond awaits me
Now only the deep pond awaits me

Wild wolf, do whatever your heart longs for
But I beg you: Stay with me!

No, girl, I will not abide with you, I'm not staying with you and don't love you!
Never loved you!

I was a fair and pretty girl
Now I'm poor and overcome with shame

Now only the deep pond awaits me
Now only the deep pond awaits me

In a contented manner she sits by the bonfire
Sanctimoniously thanking you for the hospitality
Her treacherous intentions as cold as the occasional gusts of wind kissing your back
You mistake the twinkle in her eyes for pure warm-heartedness, and have no premonition of their effect on you.
A bleak smile flickering on her lips, she beholds you with algid satisfaction, as in her sinister mind, you become her prey, her treasure, a sacrifice on the altar of her own lust.
Cursed and sacred, this arcane exercise, disembodied fiend waving through her gaze. Being a virtuoso of deceit and facetiousness, she leaves you with no chance of escape
From what is happening in your mind.
She hasn't come to crush your bones, nor tear your flesh.
She has come to steal your sanity with just one glance.

Do you feel the thorns?
Do you see the tears?
Do you see the blood shed in this fell war?
Have you forsaken us?
Have you forgotten our faithful men calling your name?

While I stand before you
While we perish
While I lay down a crimson rose
While holding hands
Are forced apart
While hopes bog like condemned men

Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

In your nemeton
These grey stone walls
Are cold and silent
As the fallen
Mother gone deaf
Mistress of shattered hopes
And forever broken dreams

Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

Epo, epo why hast thou forsaken me?
Together we go unsung
Into thy hand I commend my spirit
Together we go down with our people

Were you there? were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere
Falling on me...

The grass was as green as it always was
That sinister day
The blackbird sang their songs as they always did
That black-letter day
The day we passed the great gate for the very last time
I did not look back, I knew we'd stay

I knew they I would not let us go
Leave the death strip
I saw the gleam in their eyes of fear and enslavement
Suffering from the crushing weight

Beloveth ground take me home

Alesia, alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Iânotoutâ, eternity
Proclaim
Our barren sacrifice

On that ground we cherished life
Wr embraced death
As the children's cries trailed off
Sob yielded deathly hush

The grass as green as it always was
That sinister day
As we walked the alleys like thousand times before
I knew we'd stay

Outside Alesia
We offered a living sacrifice

Outside the doors of Alesia
Where our tears run dry

And our blood seeped away on the battlefields.

But our songs survived.
Together with those of us that returned.

And as they too will die one day,
Our songs will live on
And will be sung by our children
And by our children's children.

This is how we will be remembered.
This is who we were: Helvetios.

I wonder
What it's like
To attack at night
And mow down the defenseless
Invasions and raids just called
Fucking, punitive expeditions

Like a wildfire
Devastation spreads
Across all Gallia

From Helvetia to Eburonia
The raveners insatiate

Havoc
Think of yesterday
Ruin
A mass illusion! How could it come this far?
Our dormant minds were not prepared for this

Narbonensis was not enough
The Empire needed more
From Aremorica to Carnutia
Plagued and war-ridden land
Wars inflicted on free Gallia
An organised downfall
A black cloud of Imperial
Rapacity unleashed

Imperial needs are met
At the bloody cost of free tribes
Invasion, raid and war atrocity
In the name of S.P.Q.R.

'Cause we are indomitable and bold
'Cause we are fire (brave)
'Cause we are wave (strong)

The ears tethered to the divine tongue
Following the ancient wise
As laughter fills antumnos

Drinking from the cup of life
The well that's never running dry

In these vigilant times I daydream - an innocuous crime
My motionless stance - in my mind, I wander the land
A bleak and dismal trance

Constrained, unsafe, left in shame
and now I can see my town is painted red
here forever I'll be where once my tears were shed

On that day, in our place I recall the smell of the rain
and I'd protect you from them if you want me to take,
take you there again

Good night my love, let me watch, you sleep from here or above
Words like these won't leave this place
Be haunted by our trace, the trace of our...
HOME
The home they want call their own
But for the air that I breathe, the dreams are divine
the memories I'll bring to

A place far from home
The home they want to call province of Rome
I'm trapped without guards, within a state I can't grasp
But we're still free

I am waiting for the clouds to part, all in vain
Nature forsaken
Once admired by us all, does it know we're scared
Scared to move, scared to wake, scared just to be who we were
What matters is just you and me and the path that leads us...

Encircled by friends, the pressure deepens
Dazed by illusions, my reason weakens
But I won't let you fall into deep forlornness
I won't let you ponder the why in distress
A mechanical smile as I lift my face towards the sun
And return to denial

I weep as I kiss the ground, the trees that I'll soon miss
The songs we sang will ring out, the memories will resound

There at these ominous shores of river Saone
There at these shores the die has been cast
Valour and honour were stripped off their meaning
We will not know innocence again

At sombre nightfall the defenceless were bestially run down
Saone stained with helvetic blood
You will not shake hands with arrant beliers
You'd rather die than turn into minions

Freedom was our highest good
We ventured our lives
Meet the liar
This dead black night
Our destiny revealed
Meet the enemy
It will... never be the same

There at these portentous shores of river Saone
There at these shores the die has been cast
We saw the true face of the Roman ravener
The gorgoneion on the cuirass appeared

It was like playing ludus latrunculorum
The pieces were made of flesh and of blood
Valour and honour bereft of their meaning
The blood on your hands will forever stay

Freedom was our highest good
We ventured our lives
Meet the liar
This dead black night
Our destiny revealed
Meet the enemy
It will... never be the same

It's not us to go under the yoke
Of that fact the Roman people are witness
We will not bow (meet the liar)

A Glimpse of our safe Home
Perished in Bibracte

When I reminisce about all those years, I see many things.
Life and death strung together like the mountains and valleys in which we lived.
There was wealth and opulence, but also tribulation and loss.
There was laughter and ong, and there was also tears.

But even more than tears, blood was shed.
And so many were left to their unadorned graves, unburied.
But to us, death was but another journey.
And close by the darkness through which we strode, there was also light.
The Light of life and immortality.

And after all, when I reminisce about those years, I mostly remember our songs.
We sang as if to drown out the sound of clashing swords,
as if the battle cries fell silent.
Because war had lost its meaning.

It has been decided. We'll set forth on this journey.

We packed the wagons
Everything arranged, there is no turning back
The time has come
All too soon
A stab all through my heart

The afterglow
Glimmered on the roof of our homestead
We bode the nightfall at hand
Belive set out into the dark

In this night the fires roared
As fields were set ablaze
It rained ash from the sky
In a flaring hiss at night

Forward the land we knew
Off to far and distant shores
A safe haven
Off to these Santonian Shores

At the set of the sun
As mist billowed over the land
We got under way
Wandering, towards our hopes
I bode awhile and looked back
Gaued into the sea of flames
laying waste what we called home
I won't see this place again

A cortege as far as the eye can see
A vast migrant parade
The glow of a distant dream
the awakening came nigh
under a starlit sky
Dreams within our hearts
Step by step we marched
Away into the night

Scorched earth we left
A barren land of ash
Our fatherland laid waste
Be the void our fucking monument

At a leaden dawn
At this ominous morn

Pila loomed on the horizon
Talons of the wolverine
Exanimate legions formed
At the very gates of Avaricum
Believed invulnerable
This calling wall
But straight out of nowhere
Before our eyes this godsdawn bane arose

Thus Avaricum burns
Under a dead sky
Avaricum drowns
In blood and demise

Siege towers emerged
Protruding from the ground
Standing out against the threatening sky
As if to mock all valiantness
Face to face with an eye-leveled enemy
Serried roman ranks
Embattled upon our hold

Cut off and trapped inside
As the carnage was at hand
As the creak of the winches extolled our doom
The slaughter befell Avaricum
Dead suffused the oppidum
Left to pillage, sack and rape
Avaricum the brave became Avaricum the grave

Our villagers fall prey to pillage
How can we stay on the sideline
How long will we take this lying down?
Refuse to quell the anger
Time has come to take up arms again
The last call to rise up

Bestir
This is the flash of our last hope
Will you ally with us?
Wake up - open your eyes
Reach out
And seize this golden venture
We've lost ourselves in strife
While the raptor unopposedly
claws at Gallia's free lands
We have to call a halt this
Unite the tribes and rise
Take a look around yourself
And see this time is ours
The last call to rise up

Our lands are under fire
Our villagers fall prey to pillage
How can we stay on the sideline
How long will we take this lying down?
It is time to join forces
Let the eagles beak burst on our shields
Unite! This is Gallia uprising!

We will never perish

Our cut off hands
Proclaimed grandeur
Land can be taken but
Dignity's impregnable

Uxellodunon
Fortress of free men
Shining beacon of indomitably

Bearing witness of freedom
Bearing witness of our names,
Cause we will never...

Out from the ashes
Out from the graves
The offspring of antumnos
Will arise to life again

Oh the last stand the freedom manifesto

Is it not ironic how your favorite dread is the matrix in which you were formed?
The unfathomable dark of a realm arcane and burrowed far below

The grain sprouts from deep beneath the soil
Where sunlight will never, ever, ever reach

Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

The darkness of night goes out when dawn befalls in the time between the times
And the grain in the soil, buried deep, shall not bear fruit unless it dies
In the dark of Antumnos, the Awen waves and life is conceived

Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

The day is born from the night
In the three night of Samon, the year is born
So the song has been sung, let him hear it, who will

Is it not ironic how you cling so hard to all evidence of all there is
As you maintain your unbroken urge to explain what you can't?

The child grows in its mother's womb
Enshrouded and concealed

Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

And there was nothing

Grannus' healing touch, Cernunnos' beckon
Deo Sucellos' strike, Taranis' piercing roar
Dandelions floating like snow, witness the eternal laws of nimiety

Every single, every single one is numbered
Not one is forgotten
Every single one is just one more in Sucellus' hand
Infinitesimal and evanescent, infinitesimal and evanescent

Distant echoes ring out, exalting the unseen
Ancient mountains serenely bode the vast
All deriding the pompous futile that will be burnt to ashes and be washed away

Is it sempiternal, yet sanctifying
Waters and fires are to come

Every single, every single one is numbered
Not one is forgotten
Every single one is just one more in Sucellus' hand

They teach that the soul does not descend to the silent land of Erebus and the sunless realm of Dis below
But that the same breath still governs the limbs in a different world
If their tale be true, death is but a point in the midst of perpetual life

The ephemeral will fade, the futile will be washed away
Wounds will be healed and questions will be answered
Creation cleansed for a brand new day

Evanescent, minor and small
Insignificant, will become a little star to shine for those to come, for those to come

Holder of divine, regality bestowed in the Omphalos grove

My chosen set forth to conquer, kindling beacons
My kingdom prospered and grew
Thou shalt know me by my fruits, from the Hercynan forests

Puissance never running dry

Thou maketh me to lie down in pastures green
Thou leadest me beside still waters

Sparks of life emit when you strike

Against the waves with our swords in our hands
Against the sea with our backs to the walls
Against distress in the presence of our enemies
Against the storms roaring at our faces

A cry rang out throughout the skies
A beckon, the flight of the cranes

The call of the mountains, ooh, ooh
The call of the alps
The call home, ooh, ooh
The tune in our hearts, the song of the mountains

What's that stir, so blatant in our sallying hearts?
What's that urge that lifted up our longing eyes?
What's that ring echoing from the leaden skies?
What's that augur resounding from the lyre's strings?

A cry rang on in the sibilant winds
A behest, the outcry of the cranes

 The mountains trembled
 When the Antumnos' doors opened wide
 The ancient one stepped forth
 To bring to justice the grim tyrants
 A withered-skinned old man
 Divine Logos upon him
 His words alike the arrows in his quiver

 We followed him
 Our ears tethered to the divine tongue
 The ancient wise of Antumnos

 Our burning strength - our beacon light - our freedom's drown

 On the day of strife
 Two daughters born in pain
 To the reign of life
 Their dawning glory will shine

 "Seseroneos! Ferocious giant o Tauriscus! You wroth bull
 Long enough have you trampled over these lands!"
 A raddled aged man
 Vanquished the oppressor
 And reclaimed the lands of the West

 Our salvation - our victory

 As our lands bloomed again
 And Celtos' children grew
 Ogmios returned to Antumnos
 To attend Gobanno's feast

Under the welkin dark, solemn chants will soar
The immemorial, songs of the wise
To declare the rise of the night-born
Of glinting dew and susurrant winds
Of a vibrant dawn, long foreshown
And your pristine face pours down crystal rays

Caressed by your velvet touch, as we dance through the night
One last silver kiss, as the ancient song falls silent

The wolves from Antumnos come bearing heritage divine
In stannic pearls, the light pours over the rock-grey coats of the proud
Your radiance crystalline, heralds the ancient words
Resounding high and clear from the Otherworld
To declare the rise of the night-born

North of the yew grove, one mountain was crowned in glory and steel
Shining beacon of wealth, home of the prosperous High Princess of Noreia

One man to fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man to vanquish the rapacious beast

One fateful day it appeared, that colossal and furious boar
To feed on our sacred lands, a swath of destruction was all that remained
Iron swords were raised in vain
Asunder burst our lightning spears
Oppressed and stricken we languished in fear, until he rose

One man to fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man to vanquish the rapacious beast
One man to end the age of distress
One man to fulfill the prophecy enthean

What did close in here?
I can't remember ever shedding tears o'spite
On this ground, cropping up the fatal frontline

Like a soot-blackened palisade yet
Impelled, void and abulic
Legions delineate an ominous skyline

As lifeless demons without soul
These insentient hosts abide
Engulfing war monger get away from here!

Trod ye the path of vast deceit?
Every piece of evidence was a lie
The war, the threat's a hyping fake
To move figures on the board!

Stain Bibracte's ground!

What do you see in me?
Do you breathe-in dreams?
What spurred you to come here?
An oneiric picture of being...

Like disaffected legions taken, lure
I wonder what lies, what threat or promise
Persuaded them to leave their home that far away
...did they really know?

As the carnyx roared aloud
I quaked not, yet just asked myself
How their hearts took the bait,
These sweetened words of bitter essence

Face to face with nameless foes
Scorching words, unspoken lorn
Unheard quests remain the ashes of the dead

Forsooth we'll bear the brunt
Upright in life or in death
Yet still the countless cries echo
In silenced caves of nothing

Whirling cognition
Ulterior, the failing of words

A pageant to leave me bewildered
Lurch at the sight of the clandestine ascendancy
Pervading anima
An awe-struck principle, an adytum to find our home

Long for the rapture again
Crave for the pristine light

Vastness engulfing the soul
Unfurling this truth, an orbit in sovereignty
Sown into deep darkness
The grain has to die, perish to bestow new life

A vis major painting a rapturous view
Heralding a vivid thema

Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like bearing in pain
Like embracing life and decaying in death
Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like the caress of a mother
Like life to go withered, a perennial pneuma
I will not forget what I arose from

Decidual, the forests proclaim
The glory primal, the rapturous supremacy
Vanquishing the vile
Burgeoning beyond, bearing the essence of life

Crave for the rapture again
Long for the pristine light

Welcome to the isle of lore
Where the veil came crumbling down

There it all began,

Unclosing an enthralled door

Escalate the sense
Enhancing to join the dawn

I close my eyes, Inis Mona
And reminisce of those palmy days
I moon o'er you, Inis Mona
As long as I breathe
I'll call you my home

20 years I have walked your barrows
Years of emulous youth

There it was revealed
Enigma and freedom

In a virgin world primeval
A newborn bullcalf emerged
Wonderous and celestial
Three cranes to be its witness and droves
Its honour mantled the face of the earth

A blessing unleashed to the earth
Unseathed the embodiment of life

Tarvos - The embodiment of life
Tarvos - The genesis of time

The earthly heathlands roamed by Esus
Questing condigh sacrifice
A divine yearning hushed by the prodigy
Three cranes to wake the slumbering taur
To warn him 'gainst the imminence of a huntergod ravenous

"A drawn struggle through innominate days
As utimately the sword of Esus
Pierced the bull's heart
Three cranes to lament as its blood laves
Creation wept under an eclipsing sun
As gloom descended upon world
Three cranes to catch a drop of blood
And leave far away..."

A blessing depraved from the world
As snow fell for the first time on earth

Three cranes returned
Pouring out the blood
To the ground of Tarvos' death
And out of nothing
The soil scarified, the divine bull was reborn
Under a newborn sun nature rejoiced
Thus spring came back to earth
Overcame the brumal reigh
Though Esus came back
To fell the bull, the eternal cycle has begun

Tarvos - Will always be slain
Tarvos - Ever to be reborn again

To silence the skylark's chant
The somber kiss is at end
To impart the crimson robe

Heed the darksome maid
Dancing across this equinox
To relegate persistence
As the bleak darkness grows

A cryptal impellent, devoted to the sublime round

Beholden for the boons of light
Retreating into quietness
We harken the somber lay
We sing the somber lay

Close your eyes and heed and vide,
Then you shall see
The sphere revolves as it's promised

Flames flickering deftly
To banish the nipping air
The dark time is at hand
Lighted by bardic chant

Heed the darksome maid
To enwrap all in bleakness
A dark veil o'silence
As quiet insight buds

Darkness roaming the land
Long dead the skylark's chant
The dark vis usurped command
To impart the sallow robe

Sure a new light will come
The lifewheel is rotating onward
Given is the promise
Thus assertive we wear on

Life-given impellent, devoted to the sublime round

I've been rosin of a tree
And a leaf, by the breeze carried away

I've been a child of seven spirits
I've been an eagle in the skies
And the swashing fish in the lough fulgent
I've been star in the loosing sky
I've been a tear in the wind
And a word within paean

I've been a flower on the green pasture
I've been the song of a bird
And the vast roar of a bear
I am a lump of this vivid soil
I'm the brother of the trees
a chthonian lot of this earth

Breathe this dream, and let your soul inhale it!
Bare and naked, let us dance on the meadows

Fraught with so much greed, imperial needs.
Satisfy your hunger for might and blood!
With greedy claws the eagle flew
Leaving chaos and widows on his hunt.

We do not accept to bear the half-moon on our feet
Nor to bow, to the laurel wreath!

"Haec terra mea est" - the urge of your own want
spurring the horse towards the devastating aint.
It's the pauper that accrouches - bared indigence
Your need should cost unnumbered lives!

might and riches you have sought,
willing to pay the price in human lives!

False and fallacious, killing and omnivorous
depleting the value of human life!
But we always knew: You came with fortune
and one day you'd come with steel!

We did not accept to bear the half-moon on our feet!
A tort that pays it wage death?

Well, how does it feel, the blood on your hands?
I hope you had a ball in effacing lives!
Well, how does it feel, the blood on your hands?
I hope the gold you've won bestows your delight!

...standing at the top of all the ruin you have left...
watch our wives remigrate with crooked backs...

It pays to be insane
Indiana rain
I let go
And I made the same mistakes
Sleeping in the flame
I lost hope
Just to be alone

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

I need to hear you say please don't look away
I still want to let you let me in even when it ends
If you need to love me
Love me patiently just until you see I'm giving up
And just to make sure I've wasted all doubt
Just to make sure please wake me up now
And what won't let me down is my fear

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

I'm broken and it's hurting
And all you say is love me too
Don't take it if you know it's not enough
Maybe I'll be more tomorrow

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

Something in the way you want to be deceived
I see you sell yourself
You can trust your faith if it helps you to believe
For me it never helped
You can never suffer dissent
Never dreamt of leaving you again
And I can't pretend though I want you to
You've been a saint you can be again

I can't move on
Believe in anybody else
Until you are dead and gone or living again

Say you're something more than what shows
Because it's been so long
I need your hands intertwined again just to feel at home
You can never suffer dissent
Never dreamt of leaving you again
And I can't pretend though I want you to
You've been a saint you can be again

I can't move on
Believe in anybody else
Until you are dead and gone or living again

We end and begin
I can't stop dreaming
But I've been awake all along
To see you and break through is all I need to do
But I cannot stay when you're wrong
I cannot stay when you're gone

Somebody ought to draw the line
Having you next to me
We were both afraid to say what we think
It's part of the poetry
If I let you go and I walk away it's done
But isn't it enough to say I won't
Isn't it enough to say I can't?
And I just keep away for you
Keep away for me
You were a song to sing
A way to say I need you more
You need to stay

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

When it's hard to break it's hard to take
And the reasons why I never made it through
And I never gave you all the things that I wanted to
If I let you go and I walk away for reasons I will never know
I break
You pray

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

But you won't love a ghost
I don't and I feel you in my throat
Another taste of love
You'll never know
Never wait for it 'and now the hand you hold
Is now the hand that holds you down

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again

This isn't war
This isn't courage
This isn't how you're supposed to be
And all the things keeping you awake
Are leaving me afraid
This isn't war
This isn't courage
And I don't believe that you're okay
The reason why I forget to close my eyes
When you're next to me
I feel you're going to leave

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

The weight of loves forever trying
And it's enough to bury me
All the things keeping you awake
Are leaving finally

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

Always said the same way I'm okay
Always walk away in chains
You know we wish you'd come around
Because nothing's changed
But it doesn't feel the same

I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

I am singing songs so sing along

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no

I ain't a bad man
You could say that I am still my mother's son.
And I ain't seeing red
I am seeing everything I never was

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no
So where do we go from here?

I played the wrong hand on the other hand I played it right
And I'm taking up a throne that was already ready already mine

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no

You could be the mountains

Talking in your sleep when you're all alone
Waiting on me to come back home
I can see you walking far away
I don't know how
So I'll just wait
I'll just wait

I was half a man
You needed one that's whole
But I was giving everything because I miss you, you know

Talking in your sleep when you're all alone
Waiting on me to come back home
I can see you walking far away
I don't know why
So I'll just wait
I'll just wait

Are you happy?
Are you happier?
Yea you know me all the years I've been around
And the fears that you found out
But I'm still waiting
You believe in faith and
I believe in truth

Waiting on me to come back home

So won't you save the part of me that's broke again
And don't be hateful if I'm unfaithful
So wait
Something tells me I'm a fake
Now lie to me or run away and hide from me
How you feel

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name

There's a part of me hoping you can find a better part of me
And I've been in shambles before
But I can't feel anymore
So wait
Something tells me I might break
Now lie to me or run away and hide from me
How you feel

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name

Been awake for so long
And you say I'll be my father's son
Now I can never tell a lie to you
Because I've seen what they can do
Being in love is so lost
And I will never look again
I hope
But I know

There's a part of me hoping you can find a better part of me

Even if he tastes the same

I can feel you leaving
I can see you running out
It's faith
(Help me)
I can feel you leaving
It's a tale of what I don't have
The will to say
The filth that I became
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine

I can feel you leaving
We're burning bridges down to the fire below
Time to let it go
No you won't
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine

Show me something
Shake me from my haze
When I need your help
You never saw me coming no
Here in my personal hell
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine

Nothing left running alone
Everything was moving fast
Keeping pace with planes above
Nothing ever seems to last
I'm sorry you can't see where I'm running from
I hope to get away
Forget the way I sing the same old songs
But I always sing along

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see oh my love is it ever enough?
Because everybody seem to feel the same
And I don't know if I have a line
A line to make you want to wait
So now I'm guilt stricken silent with my head on the floor
And I'll never be the same
So to get away forget the way I play
The same old songs and make the same mistakes

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see me when it's done

And I'm learning not to love
Part of me going through emotions I can't show
Going through the motions of regret
I let go
And I'm learning I'm alone suddenly living in the moment
You both know you're falling from the same tight rope

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see me when it's done

And you'll know
You had it all
But say hello
Wait for me

Well I never had faith
I never had love
Do you believe in me?
You can have me but I'm broken in two
So say hello
Wait for me

And you wait for something on your own
And you wait for something all alone

This is a waking up
This is your final go
And I would never want to see you
Get torn apart
And I can't believe
I can't believe your apart of this world
You were a sick sad man from the start
And your not even worth my time
I can't be stopped
I'll just keep going all the way
You will try
But you will fail
Just say
It's over and it's done with
I drove around Chicago
Heading to Champaign
I passed right through a country
With a gorge as high as any
God has ever made
I saw a man beside the road
He said "Excuse me sir I think I've lost my way"
Then I told him as I pulled back
On the road and headed south
I've got no time to waste
I said I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
It doesn't matter anyway
It's the way
It's the way you want it
Everything
Everything in this place
It's the way
It's the way you want it
Everything
Everything in this place
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
This is a waking up
This is your final go
So don't you expect me to be there
When you fall
When you fall

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter

I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em

Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit

And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' it

Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth

While he's all over TV down talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like "Fuck it, I understand"
This is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?

It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk

Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous

Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us

We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further

But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws with the knockin' 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

Yeah, I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you want to cry

'Cause you're scared; I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears; daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move; mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us, I don't see us ever being together
Ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head, and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be all right
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be all right

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed or shot up on the block

And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryma start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat—one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a Rollin' Stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and, daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too: Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah; it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be all right
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be all right

And if you ask me, too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat; don't fuck with dad (haha)

Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I

The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew

That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No"
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven

But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together, too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans:
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass!
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night?

About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk

But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!
Damn...

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though"

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose

"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe"

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' "I don't give a fuck"
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

Album  Curtain Call
Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doctor ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a Mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief, my friend
I look inside my heart
I look inside my soul
I promise you
I will return

And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal,
Silence covered the sky

Take me back to the rivers of belief
Take me back to the rivers of belief, my friend
I look inside my heart
I look inside my soul
I'm reaching out for you
Lets hope one day
We'll rest in peace
On my rivers of belief

I see love, I can see passion
I feel danger, I feel obsession
Don't play games with the ones who love you
Cause I hear a voice who says:
I love you, I'll kill you

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Look into the mirror of you soul
Love and hate are one in all
Sacrifice turns to revenge and believe me
You will see the face who'll say:
I love you, I'll kill you
But I'll love you forever

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)

Inside this sick foundation
We've had the revelation

Fuck all borders

Fuck all flags

Inside this sick foundation
We've had the revelation

We begin to let them smile again
Start to walk that extra mile again
'Cause I haven't got much!
We are one

(It's not too late, it's not too late)

Stand up!
(It's not too late, it's not too late)

Things begin to vanish when we realize that
Countries are just lines
Drawn in the sand with a stick!

Today for the very first time
We started planning out the ultimate crime
Locking together to destroy this cold stasis
Rory C, what's your thesis?
I don't fucking believe it!
Institutions are established and invested
Pause to ask "are they tried and tested?"
No; just force-fed and digested.
It's about time we damn contested.

You can't stain us
You can't contain us
You cant destabilise, divide or label us
You can't stain us
You can't contain us
You cant destabilise
Destabilise

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
'cause we know
'cause we don't belong here
And we're rising through the stubborn assault course
But we're stuck in the middle
'cause we don't belong here
We don't belong here
We don't belong here
Our minds our dormant and static
Don't ever respect conventional thought without reason
We need to fucking erupt!

Corrupted fucking tyrants, instigating violence,
This sporadic discordance will find maximum assurance

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
'cause we know
'cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through the stubborn assault course
But we're stuck in the middle

'cause we don't belong here
Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
'cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through the stubborn assault course

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the norm
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you

No one owns the oceans!
No one owns the mountains!
No one owns us!
No one owns us!
We've all inherited this world!
We need to fucking erupt!
'cause this earth is ours!
We need to fucking erupt!
Yeah!

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
'cause we know
'cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through the stubborn assault course
'cause we don't belong here
Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
'cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through the stubborn assault course
'cause we don't belong here

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the norm
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you.

There was a house in a field on the side of the cliff
And the waves crashing below were just said to be a myth
So they ignored the warnings from the ships and the docks
Now the house on the cliff is the wreckage on the rocks

There was a house in a field on the side of the cliff
And the waves crashing below were just said to be a myth
So they ignored the warnings from the ships and the docks
Now the house on the cliff is the wreckage on the rocks

Nothing can fix the buildings flawed foundations
But scaffolding and stilts were the laws and legislation
This house was doomed but they didn't care
They invested in a system that was beyond repair

When I was little
I dressed up as an astronaut and explored outter space
I dressed up as a super hero and ran about the place
I dressed up as a fireman and rescued those in need
I dressed up as a doctor and cured every disease

It was crystal clear to me back then
That the only problems that I could face
Would be the same problems that effect us all

But of course this sense of common existence
Was sucked out of me in an instance
As though from birth I could walk but I was forced to crawl

So this is such exciting times
To be alive
Our generations got to fight
To survive
It's in your hands now
The future
Our future!
Our future!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'Cause I do not think we're invincible

Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path

Now don't get me wrong I love what you've done with the place
I just wish we had a chance to help build it
Instead of just moving into this home of disrepair
And expect it to work, prosper and then share

Constantly relying on consuming to feel content
But only because we've lost touch with this home that we've spent
Trillions of dollars tainting for our wants and not our needs
And now we're growing tired of planting bleary-eyed seeds

And I'm not saying that we could do better
But given a chance we'd try (we'd try)
We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil
And fill the trench with greedy eyes

And I'm not saying that we could do better
But given a chance we'd try
We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil
And fill the trench with greedy eyes

I'd imagine, I'd imagine, I'd imagine...

"I'd imagine a day as empires made haste
To colonize, to claim, to control and to contain
We sat patiently in the future, helpless"

Switch!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another Juggernaut!

Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path

What the hell will happen now?
I really don't know, man!
We'll do what we've always done!
Shut our eyes and hope for the best!
NO! We're gonna face this!
And step out onto the tracks!
Stare it, right, in the face
THOU SHALL NOT PASS!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'Cause I do not think we're invincible

Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another Juggernaut!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
And I do not think we're invincible

And I hope that we've still got time
'Cause I do not think we're invincible
The idea of community
Will be something displayed at a museum

And I'm thinking what's the deal
With the facts that they conceal
And I'm thinking what's the harm
In a bit of rhetoric and charm

And I can't quite comprehend
A beginning or an end
No I can't quite stomach this, no

You and me, we're gonna take
To the skies for common sake
We'll fly amongst the cirrus clouds
20,000 feet, we'll clock the crowds
And from that height we'll leak the lies
And unveil the damaged skies
Cause we can't quite stomach this

All I'm trying to say is
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
You're not, getting any sleep tonight

Sun and sea could power us
No longer cower in oil lust
Chernobyl is still a stain
Of the dangers of this game

Or we'll be 90 million miles from anything or anyone.

What are we waiting for?

Just like the ocean we won't be pacific anymore
No longer in coexistence with other species, now this is flawed

To loose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory
Or waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds
Don't look back now

I sweat,I ache

And a life so pretentious?

His eyes are locked on her
Her eyes are fixed elsewhere
He's confident
But he's not aware
She doesn't care

Their only connection
Is the silence they both grasp
He's lost control
But she's not aware
Of his stare

Everything seems to intimidate him
With the strobe lights flashing
Her body's jolting
But cracking
As his eyes
Spilt in two
If only she knew...

If only she knew...
If only...
If only she knew...

The curtain goes down
On him again
The curtain goes down
On him again

Everything seems to be closing in on her
It feels just like she is being hunted
But its all right
It's all good
She's not aware
Of his stare

We've had this date from the beginning
We've had this date from the beginning

The curtain goes down
On him again
The curtain goes down
On him again

Who remains when the curtain falls?
Who remains when the curtain goes down?
(on him, him, him, him)
Who remains when the curtain falls?
Who remains when the curtain goes down?

Go tell all your friends that this is the end
Go tell all your friends that this is the end
Go tell all your friends that this is the end
This is the end

I don't understand a word you're saying
what are the clouds running from?
There's something in the air tonight
Something is wrong, spit it out!

I just fell from that Mothership
They said that
Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed

There's something in the air
There's something in the air
In the air, in the air
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
In the air, in the air
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake

And I'll scream with a thousand voices...
I am sane
I am sane
My soul felt so safe up there
No self-centred natives destroying our earth

I just fell from that Mothership
They said that
Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers (your answers, your answers) they're always lying on the ocean bed

Walk the plank, walk the plank, walk the plank
Walk the plank, walk the plank, walk the plank
Walk the plank
Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed

Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed

Welcome to the skirmish
I can't feel my legs
Give me morphine

There's still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins

So when I go under the knife I believe in this
Fetch the anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the anaesthetist
So when I go under the knife I believe

You fuckin' spanner
Just a cog in the industrial complex
You shed your blood for the conflicted
You parasite
You're playin' God and you don't care who it affects
You suck the blood of the afflicted
You suck the blood of the afflicted

Illness is not an indulgence which you should pay for
Nor is it a crime for which you should be punished
For this conviction I would endanger my health, (Shut it) Oi
(Just consume, crave riches and lust for fame)
No, you won't see us participatin' in that game
Keep your twisted take on success
'Cause all I really want is what's beating in your chest

Doctor, fetch the anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the anaesthetist
So when I go under the knife I believe in this
Fetch the anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the anaesthetist
So when I go under the knife I believe

We drink to your health
But just to inform, this round's on you
And every day you roll the dice
We drink to your health
We capitalize on your condition
Bad luck, you pay the price
Bad luck, you pay the price

Fetch the anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the anaesthetist
So when I go under the knife I believe in this
You sold us short
You will not profit off our health

Drip, drip, drop, bit by bit
It's the dulcet sound of the glacial melt
Accompanied by the Beluga
Singing about the hand they've been dealt
The Emperor and the Arctic Fox listen intently

"I'm beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune
"I'm beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life
Yes, they're lost in myopia. Yes, they're lost in myopia"

Surrounded by ostriches with mouths full of sand
Their teeth grind the grains, but their faces don't contort
Perplexed, I am unable to breathe in their skin
We are all vertebrates but where is that backbone now?

"I'm beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune
"I'm beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune

As the Emperor watches his numbers plummet they hear him scream:
"They're living in denial of science
They're happy to defile silence
Yeah, they're living in denial of science
They're happy to defile silence"

"I'm beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune

Deprived is the polar bear, grasping at straws;
To safeguard dividends they depend on disbelief
Perplexed, I am unable to breathe in their skin
We are all vertebrates but where is that backbone now?

Like Socrates I only graze on the slopes
Of the summit of my own ignorance
Like Hippocrates I can affirm that the method of science
Is an appliance that emancipates us from dogma
And slant
And bias (the seasons are changing)
Ah the seasons are changing

The velocities at which we now evolve
Mean we got to dissolve unchecked tradition
But atrocities go untouched under the guise of culture
Committed on another mind another heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat (the seasons are changing)
Ah the seasons are changing
I've got a sinking feeling
I've got a sinking feeling
I've got a sinking feeling
I've got a sinking feeling

Like Sophocles we now wield the paintbrush
So keep a tight grip on a magnifying glass
Our priorities now that we hold the torch
Mean we got to hold it high to illuminate the dark
And archaic
And vile (the seasons are changing)
Ah the seasons are changing

I've got a sinking feeling
I've got a sinking feeling
I've got a sinking feeling
I've got a sinking feeling

We swear allegiance to no one

No matter how callous the shells

We'll harness the heat of the sun
And we'll burn you out of fucking existence

Album  The Mindsweep
This is an appeal to the struggling and striving
stakeholders of this planet, this floating rock we call Earth.
Alas, that means you.
That means everyone of your acquaintance,
every figure your eyes skim past in the street,
every charlatan still to defeat,
every tender face you find solace in -
now mimic the mindset William Wallace was in.
Dismount, disembark, descend from your existence,
slacken your angst and decant your hate
'cause in the long run they're about as useful
as pouring acid onto your dinner plate.
To muzzled masses that lead lives of deafening desperation:
With Excalibur aloft King Arthur earned the throne
but it's our minds we gotta wrench out of stone.
Don't be fooled by its simplicity, there was never a broadcast made of such urgency
'cause at no time before us did we grasp the scope of this emergency.
Ladle out love and logic by the boatload,
equipped with that cargo you can take any road.
Now grab life, seize time. this fight is for human kind.

I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I will read your mind.

I dart through rapids, through the streams of thought,
then suddenly I started losing my mind.
Catapulting through the uncharted
I could no longer tell if these were your thoughts or mine.

And it was as if I held a mirror up to my soul, held a mirror up to my soul.
It was as if I held a mirror up to my soul.
Who was the author and who was the observer?
Who was the author and who was the observer?
For at the last analysis our thoughts coalesced.

You are not alone. You are not alone.

You have entered volatile territory,
you have started a journey, you're part of this story.
And this, this was just a glimpse, just a glimpse.
You've no idea what you've got yourself into.
You've no idea what you've got yourself into.

I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I am a mindsweeper, focus on me, on me.

It goes on through volatile territory
Through the plains of adversity and the ravines of neurosis
Through the veins of gods and the valley of death

But remember, but remember, you are not alone
And we dance like knights

Here come the cavalry
Here come the cavalry
Oh am I glad to see your face

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
Take it away, boys!

I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood

The same blood gushes through my veins
Feel it surge
Feel it surge
Sweep through the jet streams
Down axons
And across synapses

Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur

I refuse to notice the wind or the rain
To teach me of nature would be done in vain
I ignore all:
I just contain

Predicated on a great disconnect
I don't react and I do not reflect
I ignore all:
I just retain

The invisible hand no longer guides, it chokes;
The invisible hand no longer guides

They blew up the bank of England
The paper burnt for days
They blew up the bank of England
Oh

In the end we all employ sabotage
No room for ethics now, greed is in charge
I ignore all:
I just constrain

How many barrels are left in the field?
I only care for the coins that you yield
I ignore all:
I just obtain

As one child is taught red on his mother's knee (the one true colour)
A neighbour is taught blue on his mother's knee (the one true colour)
With a fervour inherited, it will be subsequently delivered
Ignore the spectrum

Dear whom it may concern,
I feel as though I'm about to crash and burn
I think I'm falling and there's no return
But I've no idea to whom this may concern
I'm looking out at all the stars and I learn
There's no one up above to hear me yearn
I'm on my own

In the arena of the endless unknown
Do not stage theatre and call it truth
And when one child is taught red on his mother's knee
It must be subsequently delivered

Someone upturned the furniture in my mind

Rote Erde ziert das Land
Dichte Wälder ausgebrannt
Schwarze Wolken überall
Verkünden zornig den Zerfall

Dunkle Posaunen der Nacht
Rufen die Krieger zur Schlacht

Wollt ihr euer Heim vernichten?
Eure Türme fallen schon!
Wollt ihr über alles richten?
Euer Volk ist auch gefloh'n!
Wollt ihr euer Herz verlieren?
Eure Ehr' ist so nichts wert!
Und wollt ihr euch selbst ausradieren?
Auf dass ihr niemals wiederkehrt!

Kranke Wesen schreien laut
Fäule sich zusammenbraut
Leere Augen seh'n die Not
An jeder Front riecht es nach Tod

Ein Schwert, im Wahn
Habt ihr euch angetan
Im Wahn, ein Schwert
Die Richtung ist verkehrt

Wollt ihr euer Heim vernichten?
Eure Türme fallen schon!
Wollt ihr über alles richten?
Euer Volk ist auch gefloh'n!
Wollt ihr euer Herz verlieren?
Eure Ehr' ist so nichts wert!
Und wollt ihr euch selbst ausradieren?
Auf dass ihr niemals wiederkehrt!

Und zeigt ihr keine Einsicht
Wollt ihr euch nicht umdreh'n
So wird Gevatter Tod euch hol'n

Soll euch entleiben
Das Lebenslicht austreiben
Soll neu entstehen was ihr habt gestohl'n

Ich hab' an jenem Morgen
Ein Samenkorn gesät
An einem Ort den ihr nicht kennt

Ich kann ihn euch erst zeigen
Wenn ihr zu schätzen wisst
Was dieses Reich
Euch hat geschenkt

Wollt ihr euer Heim vernichten?
Eure Türme fallen schon!
Wollt ihr über alles richten?
Euer Volk ist auch gefloh'n!
Wollt ihr euer Herz verlieren?
Eure Ehr' ist so nichts wert!
Und wollt ihr euch selbst ausradieren?
Auf dass ihr niemals wiederkehrt!

Hier dort wo
Kein Schatten mehr irrt
Wird meine Furcht nun zu Staub

Und jetzt breit' ich meine Arme aus
Heb mein Haupt und blicke hoch hinaus
Vor mir die Weite und kein einz'ger Pfad
Drum stürm ich los und springe ab!

Am Ziel liegt der Schatz
Glühend an Gipfeln vorbei

Eng bepackt
Kein Zweifel hat Platz
Ich brech ihn aufrecht entzwei!

Kein Sturm und Hagel blieb uns erspart
Seit Wochen tun wir unsere Pflicht
Doch jetzt ist endlich Land in Sicht!

Land in Sicht!

Am Ziel nun angekomm'n
Die letzten Meter bin ich geschwomm'n
Die Möwen singen schon und
Rufen mich heran
Gleich geht er los der Tanz drum
Schwing ich mich in den Blumenkranz
Die Insel zieht mich in ihren Bann

Dies ist der Augenblick der mir offenbart
Dass gute Tat sich macht bezahlt
Drum werd ich mich beschenken so wie ich mag
Denn heut ist Feiertag!

Ich lass die Schwerter los und
Lass mich fallen in's grüne Moos
Die Augen schweifen bis zum
Sonnenuntergang
Das Feuer knistert leise und
Steigt zum Himmel, geht auf die Reise
Doch ich bleib erstmal hier und
Streck die Beine lang

Drum werd ich mich beschenken so wie ich mag

Schaut nach vorn
Nicht zurück
Wenn wir weitergehn naht auch uns das Glück
Schaut nach vorn
Nicht zurück
Nur gemeinsam stemmen wir dieses Stück
Vereint im Leid
Lachen wir und schmäh'n das Totenkleid
Schaut nach vorn
Denn noch ist nichts verlor'n!

Wer uns vor dem Tod bewahrt?
Kriechen wir auf unser'm Grab?
Bleibt die Sanduhr stehen?
Wird sie keiner dreh'n?

Doch dann erstrahlt die Hoffnung
In herrlich grünem Schein
Nach endlos Fels und Sand
Wird unser Heil jetzt sein

Schaut nach vorn
Nicht zurück
Wenn wir weitergehn naht auch uns das Glück
Schaut nach vorn
Nicht zurück
Nur gemeinsam stemmen wir dieses Stück
Vereint im Leid
Lachen wir und schmäh'n das Totenkleid
Schaut nach vorn
Denn noch ist nichts verlor'n!

Am Berges Fuß ich steh'
Im Schatten jener Macht
Das Gipfelkreuz ich seh'
In seiner ganzen Pracht
Hinauf mein Weg mich führt
So sei nun mein Gedicht
Hab' es mir selbst erkürt
Der Weg zurück, den gibt es nicht!

Um meinen Hals trag ich stets diesen Stein
Ein Blick auf ihn sagt mir ich bin nicht allein
Denn einst war er schon meiner Vorfahr'n Besitz
Bot Kühnheit und Stärke bei Donner und Blitz
Groß wird sein mein Sold
Noch viel mehr, als pures Gold
Wenn ich oben bin
Meiner Ahnen ich mich entsinn'

Entlang der eisig Klamm
Vorbei am Dorngebüsch
Ich kriech' auch durch den Schlamm
Dann stink' ich halt nach Fisch
Die Schluchten wittern schon
Ganz hämisch grinsend ist ihr Blick
Doch ich will rauf zum Thron
Und lach' mit breiter Brust zurück

Um meinen Hals trag ich stets diesen Stein
Ein Blick auf ihn sagt mir ich bin nicht allein
Denn einst war er schon meiner Vorfahr'n Besitz
Bot Kühnheit und Stärke bei Donner und Blitz
Groß wird sein mein Sold
Noch viel mehr, als pures Gold
Wenn ich oben bin
Meiner Ahnen ich mich entsinn'

Um meinen Hals trag ich stets diesen Stein
Ein Blick auf ihn sagt mir ich bin nicht allein
Ich weiß ohne euch würde ich hier nicht steh'n
Ich werde euch danken wenn wir uns wiederseh'n!

Standing where the moon glows through
A silent clearing, me and you
Surrounded by bright fireflies
I see the sparkling in your eyes

We have the light on our side
No fright no fear will now appear
It's our fate to push the gate
The unknown episode awaits

Breath of pine trees in the air
I slightly stroke red shimmering hair
One quick glance of you tells me
That you're prepared to turn the key
Deep inside the heaven's tent
The stars are shining with consense
So I will reach out my hand
To walk with you towards green land

We have the light on our side
No fright no fear will now appear
It's our fate to push the gate
The unknown episode awaits

Wieder mal ist es soweit
Ein Tag zum feiern, es wurd'auch Zeit!
Die Krüge bis zum Rand gefüllt
Warten bis der Erste brüllt!
Einmal stoss ich an mit mir
Zweimal mit 'nem alten Stier
Dreimal Prost dem frommen Lamm
Viermall muss die Drecksau ran!

Doch zu guter Letzt fehlt noch:
Du, mein Freund, leb' ewig hoch!
Hoch!
Hoch!
Ewig Hoch!

Prost ihr Säue!
Hoch die Biere!
Sauft aus!
Ihr Tiere!

Als Not zugegen war so teilten wir das Zelt
Die Rücken zugewandt durchschritten wir das Feld

Dunkel zog am Himmelszelt die finst're Schar entlang
Doch unser Mut beständig bleib durch uns'rer Flöten Klang

Prost ihr Säue!
Hoch die Biere!
Sauft aus!

Stahl gefällt und Stein gekaut
Drei Schlösser hab ich aufgebaut
Für einen König der mir fremd
Für den mein Heiligtum verbrennt
So bin ich um die Welt gereist
Das Meer und auch mein Herz vereist
Die Knochen liegen auf dem Sand
Und obendrauf kocht mein Verstand

Auf weiten Steppen
Will ich entdecken
Den Ort der mir von Freiheit singt
Auf weiten Steppen
Da werde ich entdecken
Den Ort der mir die Freiheit bringt

Tritt ein
Und sprich
Waldschrein
Hört dich
Reich mir
Die Hand
Komm in
Mein Land

Ergreife deine Sinne
Und spür die Energie
Erweck das tote Fleisch in dir

So hoch weh'n die Fahnen
Erzähl'n uns von den Ahnen
Die schon damals her kamen
Wissend der Macht
So tief Wurzeln schreiten
Sich Kräfte in mir ausbreiten
Formen mich empor zum Turm
Trotzend dem Sturm

Jetzt sind wir wieder da
Nach ewig langer Zeit
Gefühlt einhundert Jahr'
Ein Ende hat die Einsamkeit

Der Bart er wurde lang
Und manches Haar auch grau
Ganz voller Überschwang
So hasten wir aus uns'rem Bau

Doch wir sind nicht allein
Haben euch was mitgebracht
Die Geister aus dem Wald
Begleiten uns durch Tag und Nacht

So seid ihr denn bereit
Die Pferde warten dort
Zu jeder Jahreszeit
Bringen sie uns hin zum and'ren Ort

Faust nach oben
Streck sie aus
Greif die Sterne
Reiß sie raus
Nie verliern wir unsern Mut
Was lange währt wird endlich gut

Tief in dunkler Nacht
Schwere Taue los gemacht
Und der Wind, er flüstert uns Kühnheit zu
Sind bereit für den Auftakt in Ruh'

Lauthals tönt das Horn
Uns're Augen ziel'n nach vorn
Wo das Wasser schimmert im Mondeslicht
Klar ist der Geist und klar ist die Sicht

Und so fahr' wir übers Meer
Weit entfernt liegt die Wiederkehr
Keine Boje, kein Turm der scheint
Doch wir stehen vereint
Und so zieh'n wir durch die See
Küstennebel in jedermanns Tee
Uns're Weiber mit an Bord
Geht die Reise gen Nord!

Stets begleitet vom Wellenklang
Fernab vom Land wir lauschen gebannt zum
Geisterhaften Urgesang der
Nymphenschar
Treu flankiert uns das Sternenzelt
Monumental umhüllt vom All
Dirigiert es uns um die Welt herum

Und so fahr' wir übers Meer
Weit entfernt liegt die Wiederkehr
Keine Boje, kein Turm der scheint
Doch wir stehen vereint
Und so zieh'n wir durch die See
Küstennebel in jedermanns Tee
Uns're Weiber mit an Bord
Geht die Reise gen Nord!

Vor uns bäumt sich eine Welle auf
Donnernd nimmt sie eilends ihren Lauf

Tapfer drehen wir bei
Jedes Hadern ist einerlei
Reiten auf ihr geschwind
Wohin sie uns wohl bringt?

Mein gold'ner Bierkrug der ist leer
Wo krieg ich denn jetzt Nachschub her?
Ich schwing mich auf das Pferd geschwind
Mal schau'n was ich zu zechen find

Dort, ein Haus, das schaut nach Schenke aus
Mach hoch die Tür, das Tor macht weit
Der Robse ist bereit

Hallo lieber Wirt mach mir den Bierkrug voll
Ganz randvoll - So ist's toll
Hallo lieber Wirt komm setz dich hin zu mir
Hin zu mir und trink auch du ein Bier

Sind die Krüge leer
Die Kehle nicht mehr nass
Dann stehen wir gemeinsam auf und holen noch ein Fass

Hallo lieber Wirt mach mir den Bierkrug voll
Ganz randvoll - Sonst sing'n wir nicht in Moll

So langsam herrscht hier reges treiben
Denn keiner wollt zu Hause bleiben
Die Frauen tanzen und die Männer auch
Und immer dicker wird der Bauch

Hallo lieber Wirt mach mir den Bierkrug voll

Was ich sah auf meiner Reise,
Scheint zu wahr es zu erzähl'n,
Drum versuch ich auf meine Weise,
Euch mit mir dort hinzunehm'n.

Wie ich einst auf dunklen Pfaden,
Weit von hier in Nordens Land,
Sah was mir den Atem raubte,
Was ich bis da nicht gekannt.

Blut im Auge
Auf wunde Knie
So sank ich nieder
So fand ich sie

So beschloss ich dort zu bleiben.
Was ich sah, ließ mich nicht mehr los,
Zu entdecken ihr Geheimnis,
War die Nacht für mich verlor'n.

Tag um Tag in grauem Regen,
Suchte ich den Blick noch mal,
War verfallen jenem Zauber,
Den ich bisher nicht erahnt.

Blut im Auge
Auf wunde Knie
So sank ich nieder
So fand ich sie

Ließ zurück der Städte Tore,
zog hinauf in eisige Höh'n
Sturmgewitter, Donners Peitschen
Suchten mich zu Grund zu gehn
Blickte in des Wassers Fälle,
Hinter Sträucher, Birkenhain
Unruhig Blicke, grau die Wogen,
Wo mag sie geblieben sein?

Schlaflos, rastlos such ich...
Lautlos, raunend, hört sie mich nicht...

Über Felsen, Berg und Heide,
Dickicht, Dornen, Dunkelheit,
Such ich sie bei Nacht, die Weiße,
Such den gleißend' Himmelsschein...

I touched her ooohh,
She touched my ahhh,
It was the craziest thing.
I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me.

A certain girl, she took my hand and ran it up her thigh.
She licked her lips and pulled my hair
I fall in love for a night.

She can't behave and I'm just a slave,
Don't worry I'll be gone when the morning comes.

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion.
Leave me, go where you belong,
Higher heels and lipstick napkins,
Dying is your latest fashion.

The frustration, it's a regular thing
I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me.
A certain girl she took her hand and put in my lap
It's way too full she said "once you have me you'll always come back."

She can't behave and I'm just a slave,
Don't worry I'll be gone when the morning comes.

And all it takes is a kiss
And you just love to hate me.

So don't act surprised
That I just love to hate you.

I kissed your lips, you pulled my hair
It was the craziest thing.
I love the girls who love to hate.

So now you're running
It's hard to see clearly
When I make you angry
You're stuck in the past

And now you're screaming
So can you forgive me?
I've treated you badly
But I am still here

Sometimes I wonder
Why I'm still waiting
Sometimes I'm shaking
That's how you make me
Sometimes I question
Why I am still here
Sometimes I think I am going crazy

Can you help me understand?
And now you wish that you meant something
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
And now you wish that you met someone
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else

You look at me through clouded eyes
I know you see through my lies
See the sky, see the stars
All of this could be ours
Out of sight, out of mind
We've been through this a thousand times
Turn your back and then you make me feel so crazy

Can you help me understand?
And now you wish that you meant something

I want to be dead with my friends

Wide-eyed, brilliant, dynamic rest
I want to be dead with my friends

Where the iron sharpens the iron

I want to be dead with my friends
A vulgar, loud, unforgettable end
I want to be dead with my friends

Let boredom cease the beating of our purple hearts
Against this, even gods fight violently in vain
What chance could we have stood?
We're the last of the lost,
But now we are the first of the fashionably late

Loved ones decompose
You'll dance around the bones
But most of us are wholly ghosts
All of us were wholly ghosts

We made the scene when we made a scene
And though it was brief, it meant everything

Oh, what a pity, now they're bound to make us saints

Against this, even boys fight violently in vain
What chance could we have stood?
We're the last of the lost,
but now we are the first of the fashionably late

I refuse to be the only man put to rest in a mass grave

You were all there with me

Baby,
you got me all wrong.
And maybe,
I'm not all down and out
I'm high and I'm in.

Don't you know who I am?
I'm the jaded one with pop insensitivity.
When I finish struggling,
we can make our way to the dance floor,
and stand like strangers,
in an elevator stuck between stories.
I always find myself in the middle of your stories.

With the cameras as a witness I will suffer!

If everything I do is wrong then, by God, I'll do it right.

We don't dance no, no, no...
We got class!
No, we don't have any fun at all.
It's the new style and we know it!
We're not stunning, we're just stunned!

We're lying for a living!

Don't you know who I am?
I'm the real thing with low-key sensibilities.
I don't need what I've got,
half as much as everyone covets it!

Well, if loving me is wrong then goddamn you do it right.

It turns us on to turn you down!
We're turned on to turn you down!

Du warst noch nie der Hellste und der Schnellste warst du nie.
Kein Mensch auf dieser Welt hielt dich je für einen Genie.
Freunde hast du keine, Keinen der dich richtig mag.
Warst immer nur alleine, dein ganzes Leben, jeden Tag.
An einem solcher Tage kommt ein Mann auf dich zu.
Er beschreibt dir deine Lage, lässt dir auch keine Ruh.
Darum komm mit mir und hab Vertrauen zu mir.
Marschier' im rechten Schritt, und dann helfe ich auch dir.

Willkommen in Deutschland.
Wo Idioten aufmarschieren, und Lichterketten brennen,
um das Gesicht nicht zu verlieren.
Willkommen in Deutschland.
Der Eintritt, der ist frei, halts Maul und pass dich an,
und schon bist du dabei.
Willkommen in Deutschland.

So oder so ähnlich könnte es gelaufen sein.
Doch der Irregeführte ist ein trügerischer Schein.
Täter werden so zu Opfern, die Gesellschaft ist halt schuld.
Ein bisschen Jugendarbeit und etwas mehr Geduld.
Akzeptiert als anders sein, als neue Subkultur.
Dagegen zu sein, dient der Imagekorrektur.
Mitläufer und Einzeltäter, ein gern gemaltes Bild.
Deutschland ist nicht böse, Harmoniebedarf gestillt.

Liebe Wählerinnen und Wähler
Ich freue mich sehr heute zu Ihnen
Als einer von Ihnen reden zu dürfen
Hier und jetzt verspreche ich mich mit all meiner Kraft
Für dieses Land einzusetzen
Und mit Ihrer Stimme haben sie die Möglichkeit
Bei der nächsten Wahl maßgeblich
An dieser Herausforderung beteiligt zu sein
Ich danke Ihnen und denken sie immer daran
Jede Stimme zählt

Die Leute hören zu wie ich große Reden schwinge
Wie ich trotz der Heuchelei ihr Vertrauen schnell gewinne
Ein Versprechen wir gegeben aber niemals eingehalten
Meine Worte dienen dazu euer Elend zu verwalten
Ich setz mich dafür ein Traditionen zu bewahren
Doch das soll nicht heißen bei Diäten einzusparen
Euer Leben eure Wünsche finde ich völlig banal
Heute brauch ich eure Stimme morgen seid ihr mir egal

Trotzdem bitte ich dich
Wähle dieses mal doch mich
Und ich werde mein Versprechen halten

Steuern runter Bildung rauf
Das alles nur für dich
Nicht für mich nur für dich
Und deine kleine Welt

Alle vier Jahre stelle ich mich zur Wahl
Alle vier Jahre bis zum nächsten mal
Alle vier Jahre siehst du mein Plakat
Alle vier Jahre bin ich dein Demokrat

Natürlich hören wir zu wenn du deine Reden schwingst
Aber glaube bitte nicht dass du uns damit gewinnst
Sämtliche Versprechen wurden schon einmal versprochen
Und alle diese Schwüre wurden jedes mal gebrochen
Wir setzen uns dafür ein deine Lügen aufzudecken
Jede Möglichkeit zu nutzen um die Menschen aufzuwecken
Unser Leben unsere Wünsche sind für dich völlig banal
Heute brauchst du unsere Stimme morgen sind wir dir egal

Doch ich sage dir
Meine Stimme gehört mir
Und die werde ich dir niemals geben

Bildung runter Steuern rauf
Und das alles nur für dich
Nicht für mich nur für dich
Bis dass der Vorhang fällt

Alle vier Jahre lügst du uns ins Gesicht
Alle vier Jahre glauben wir dir nicht
Alle vier Jahre nur bist du Demokrat
Alle vier Jahre verbrennen wir dein Plakat

Was können wir noch verändern
Wie sollen wir uns wehren
Wenn alle Konkurrenten sind
und jeder gegen jeden kämpft
dann muss irgendwas geschehen
Wie bekämpft man das große Ganze
das Wir viel zu lange sind
das fast jeder akzeptiert hat
und es unvermeidbar nennt
dann muss irgendwas passieren

Refr:

Augen auf und durch
es gibt noch viel zu tun
auf Frustration und Ohnmacht
sollten wir uns nicht ausruhen
Ein steiniger Weg
liegt vor dem was für uns zählt
mit jeden dieser Steine
bauen wir uns ne andere Welt
Augen auf und durch
es gibt noch viel zu tun
auf Frustration und Ohnmacht
können wir uns nicht ausruhen
Ein steiniger Weg
liegt vor unserm Glück
doch jeden dieser Steine
werfen wir einfach zurück

Was auf den Tisch kommt wird gegessen
lernen wir doch schon als Kind
Sie bekämpfen unsere Zweifel
wie berechtigt sie auch sind
egal wie heftig sie auch sind
Es kam wie es kommen musste
wurde mir ständig erzählt
und mit Arbeit, Fressen, Fernsehen
ist das Leben doch so wunderschön
fast als wäre nichts geschehen

Ist es denn so schwer sich vom alten Dreck zu trennen
dieses Denken in Nationen und Religionen zu beenden
Wie lange werde ich denn noch als Spinner ausglacht
nur weil ich mir Gedanken über andere Wege mache
Na klar ich gebe zu ich habe ne riesengroße Angst
vor dem was da noch kommt und jedem neuen Tag
Es wäre meine Pflicht, auch ich habe es in der Hand
trotzdem stehe ich dumm und glücklich am eigenen Tellerrand

jetzt hetzen und jagen sie dich durch deine stadt
sie rufen und schreien wir machen dich platt
du opfer du bastard gleich haben wir dich
und wenn wir dich haben dann bricht dein genick

plötzlich spürst du wie dein herz schlägt
blut durch deine adern fließt
und sich langsam deine hand
zu einer faust zusammenschließt
dein körper voll adrenalin
spürst keine angst spürst keine schmerzen
trägst nur das eine bild
in deinem kopf in deinem herzen

jetzt geht es los ein großer knall
es fliegen scherben überall
und da liegt blut
von wem das kann ich dir nicht sagen
mit dem rücken ander wand
jetzt geht es los ein großer knall
es fliegen scherben überall

von wem das kann ich dir nicht sagen

mit dem rücken an der wand
blieb dir nur die flucht nach vorn
also stellst du dich dem kampf
denn aus angst wird zorn

Im Gewand der Vernunft
Wird nach und nach alles begraben
Gebt jeden Menschen eine Nummer
Vom ersten bis zum letzten Tag

Zum Gunsten meiner Sicherheit
Wird jeder Schritt von mir begleitet
Zum Gunsten meiner Sicherheit
Jede Bewegung abgespeichert

Doch die Bedrohung das seid ihr
Weil ihr Bedrohung produziert
Mit hysterischen Szenarien
Werden die Medien dominiert
Somit schreit das ganze Land
Nach der großen starken Hand
Einer sicheren Umarmung
Durch den Überwachungsstaat

Wer ist als nächstes im Visier?
Und wird daraus ein Fadenkreuz?
Meine kleine Insel Freiheit...
In einem Meer von Sicherheit

Wer ist als nächstes im Visier?
Und wird daraus ein Fadenkreuz?
Diese kleine Insel Freiheit...
In einem Meer von Sicherheit

Jetzt wird die Ausnahme zur Regel
Und die Regel ein Gesetz
Denn viele kleine Raster bilden ein perfektes Netz
Ist das Netz erstmal gespannt und in den Datenfluss gestellt
Wird die Jagdsaison eröffnet und der Beifall gezählt
Im Anti-Terror-Kampf und im Namen des Gesetzes
Werden immer wieder meine Grundrechte verletzt
Das stört hier keine Sau und das is auch nicht wirklich neu
Ein ganzes Land hinter Gardinen
Bleibt seinen ängsten Treu

Wer ist als nächstes im Visier?
Und wird daraus ein Fadenkreuz?
Meine kleine Insel Freiheit...

Grüße noch an Huxley - es wird schon alles gut
Ich blicke in die Zukunft
In eine ferne Zeit
Und wart' auf den Moment dass mich die Hoffnung doch befreit

Wer ist als nächstes im Visier?
Und wird daraus ein Fadenkreuz?

Nicht, dass wir uns da irgendwie falsch verstehen
Ich will euch nicht alles nehmen, aber doch ein wenig...

Der Höhenflug ist jetzt beendet alle Kurse sind gefallen
Nur ihr fallt niemals hinterher
Ihr seid wie immer weich gelandet
Auf dem Rücken all der Anderen,
Die ihr vorher noch kurz weg saniert habt

Danach geht's erstmal in den Urlaub
Luxusklasse, wie gewohnt
Ein bisschen Wellness muss jetzt sein
Die letzte Zeit war turbulent
Geld stinkt doch, wenn es verbrennt
Zum Glück ist es nicht deins gewesen.

Und ich schwör dir, irgendwann kommt dieser Tag
An dem wir doch gemeinsam an der Tafel stehen
Und ich schwör dir, dieses mal bin ich wie du ein Egoist
Und fresse vor dir alles weg
... und werde nach dir untergehen

Nicht, dass wir uns da irgendwie falsch verstehen
Es hat kein Mensch verdient viele Milliarden zu besitzen
Dieser Schatz sollte doch uns allen dienen
Und wenn ich das richtig seh'
Können wir uns die Reichen nicht mehr leisten

Ich habe lange überlegt, welch Überraschung
die Prognosen stehen äußerst schlecht.
Das soll nicht heißen, dass es früher besser war.
Doch unsere Zukunft male ich in schwarz,
denn die Zeichen stehen auf Sturm
für die nächste große Schlacht.
Ein Weltenbrand wird neu entfacht,
denn Gründe gibt's genug eventuell sogar zu viel.
Nach wie viel Krisen kommt der Krieg

Bis hier hin ging es gut,
doch vermutlich wird es schlimm.
Meine Welt hat keine Farben,
weil ich Schwarzmaler bin
Bis hier hin ging es gut,
doch vermutlich wird es schlimm.
Jetzt male ich Bilder ohne Farben,
weil ich Schwarzmaler bin.

Ich habe lange überlegt, welch Überraschung:
Die Prognosen bleiben äußerst schlecht.
Schau ich nach vorne sehe ich nur Vergangenheit
und all die Rattenfänger machen sich bereit,
denn ungezählte Menschenhände
legen Feuer, schüren Brände.
Alle Macht hat, wer die Meinung macht.
Was willst du mit Vernunft in einer Zeit der Hysterie?
Ein schriller Ton wird zu Musik.

Bis hier hin ging es gut,
doch vermutlich wird es schlimm.
Meine Welt hat keine Farben,
weil ich Schwarzmaler bin
Bis hier hin ging es gut,
doch vermutlich wird es schlimm.
Jetzt male ich Bilder ohne Farben,
weil ich Schwarzmaler bin.

Und die Hoffnung starb zuletzt.
Auf der suche nach dem Sinn.
Meine Welt kennt keine Farben mehr,
weil ich Schwarzmaler, Schwarzmaler, Schwarzmaler bin.

Das wurde aber endlich auch mal Zeit,
dass sich jemand traut das alles aufzuschreiben.
Die Mitte der Gesellschaft steht bereit,
um moralgetränkt auf Ausländer zu zeigen.

Die Ruhe vor dem Sturm wird immer lauter,
denn der Traum vom Sommermärchen ist vorbei.
Durch Ausgrenzung des Fremden wächst zusammen.
Wer mit dem Feuer spielt, der spielt auch mit den Flammen!

Was tun wenn's brennt,
wenn ein aufgehetzter Mob sich zu Selbstjustiz bekennt?
Was tun wenn's knallt,
wenn angestauter Hass wieder umschlägt in Gewalt?

Was tun wenn's brennt,
wenn ein aufgehetzter Mob sich zu Selbstjustiz bekennt?
Was tun wenn's knallt,
wenn angestauter Hass wieder umschlägt in Gewalt?

Der Wind in deinen Segeln ist nichts weiter,
als prima inszenierte heiße Luft.
Und sorgenvoll schaust du in die Statistik,
denn wer ausstirbt hat zum Jammern Grund genug.

Was bildest du dir ein?
Was glaubst du, wer du bist?
Deine Pseudowissenschaften
sind wirklich äußerst widerlich.

Mit unhaltbaren Thesen werden Menschen diffamiert,
in Schichten eingeteilt und genetisch einsortiert.
In Ablehnung der Anderen wird das Land endlich vereint.
In Ablehnung der Anderen können alle einig sein.

Was tun wenn's brennt,
wenn ein aufgehetzter Mob sich zu Selbstjustiz bekennt?
Was tun wenn's knallt,
wenn angestauter Hass wieder umschlägt in Gewalt?

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth

The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace

No!

It's like the pattern below the skin
You gotta reach out and pull it all in
And you feel like you're too close
So you swallow another dose
The pinnacle of happiness
Filling up your soul
You don't think you can take any more
You never wanna let go
To touch the roots of experience
The most basic ingredients
To see the unseen glitter of life
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife
Cherish the certainly of now
It kills you a bit at a time
Cradle the inspiration
It will leave you writhing on the floor

This is so unreal, what I feel
This nourishment, life is bent
Into a shape I can hold
A twist of fate, all my own
Just grit your teeth, make no sound
Take a step away and look around
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
The whisper is but a shout
That's what it is all about
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away

Like the sacred song that someone sings through you (through you)
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into (into)
Like the dream you know one day will come to life (life)
Try to hold on just a little longer (longer), stronger (stronger)

It's the jewel of victory
The chasm of misery
And once you have bitten the core
You will always know the flavor
The split second of divinity
You drink up the sky
All of heaven is in your arms
You know the reason why
It's right there, all by itself
And what you are, there is nothing else
You're growing a life within a life
The lips of wonder kiss you inside
And when it's over the feeling remains
It all comes down to this
The smoke clears, I see what it is
That made me feel this way

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth
The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace

This is so unreal, what I feel
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
Pump through your veins, can't explain
The element that's everything
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away

Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
Like the first time love urged you to take its guidance, in silence
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
Like the way you cry for a happy ending (ending, ending, ending, ending, ending)

(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)
(I know the feeling)
(It is the real thing)

Time waits for no one
Unjust and unkind
All dreams are left behind
In time... in time

I rust and decay
With every wasted day
In sorrow and dismay
My life, it fades away

Is nothing ever built to last?
Must precious moments always pass
With no regret and no restrain?
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Strung out on a sad refrain
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Time waits for no one
Unjust and unkind
All hopes are left behind
In time... in time

I rust and decay
With every wasted day
In sorrow and dismay
My life, it fades away

Is nothing ever built to last?
Must precious moments always pass
With no regret and no restrain?
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Strung out on a sad refrain
A second of joy per lifetime of pain

Pain will fade in time
My dreams get lost in time
And love will die in time
As I will die in time

In time...

I think I found what I'm looking for
Behind those eyes and open door
That vacant stare, which I adore
I'm your slut and you're my whore

Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the pain
Let us just make believe
It's yesterday again

And mother, if you're watching, look away
And mother, if you're wondering
But don't know what to say...
Mother, if you're watching, look away
Just look away

I think I found what I'm looking for
So hit the lights, and shut the door
Listen carefully, here's the score
I'm your slut and you're my whore

Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the shame
Let us just make believe
It's yesterday again

And mother, if you're watching, look away
And mother, if you're wondering
But don't know what to say...
Mother, if you're watching, look away
Look away

It sometimes makes me sick inside
Ashamed of a life that I must hide
I know you'll never understand
I'm sorry there's no wedding band

But deep inside there's still that child
Innocent in a world gone wild
Obediant of your moral code
Scarred by the Christian overlord

But still I live by truth and love
I still have hopes in the above
I still have interest in the cross
But mother if you're listening, shut it off

Mother if you're watching, look away
Just look away
Just look away
Just look away

I'm in too deep, I've gone too far
I've lost all innocence and shame
I've attitude to be a star
I'm destined toward greater fame

I've got the look they say you need
I've got drive and inherent greed
And soon the world will know my name
I'm winning at a losing game

I'm the latest fashion
Your deepest passion
Upon your wall I'm hung
But like fashion trends
When the passion ends
People like me die young
People like me die young

I'm in the lap of luxury
The cover of the magazine
I'm who the world longs to be
I'm huge upon the silver screen

I'm well aware, and yes I know
That once I reach the top of this
There's only one place left to go
And money won't buy happiness

I'm the latest fashion

Und du weißt, nach jeder Party folgt alleine sein
Und du weißt, die Erkenntnis nur aufgesetzt erscheint
Und du weißt, bist deiner Würde hinterher gerannt
Ich bin völlig ausgebrannt

Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh oh oh

Viel zu oft Glitzer im Gesicht und Scheiße im Gehirn
Viel zu oft falsche Leute im richtigen Zwirn
Viel zu oft einstudiertes, halbherziges Umarmen
Ich pass nicht in euren Rahmen

Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh oh oh

Viel zu viel, kein Ventil
Ich habe Angst mich selber zu verlieren
Kampflos schwach, pöbelnd durch die Nacht
Kriegs nicht mehr hin hier noch zu funktionieren

Viel zu viel, kein Ventil
Ich habe Angst mich selber zu verlieren
Kampflos schwach, pöbelnd durch die Nacht

Wirklich nie daran geglaubt
Wirklich nie daran gedacht
Das Gerede von *mal rauskommen*
Haben wir oft genug belacht
Schauen uns nur ungläubig an
Haben wir das hier echt geschafft
Dieser Traum begann, begann
Begann erst nach dem Schlaf

Sind nun ständig unterwegs
Zwischen Party, Suff und Tour
Endlich zahlt es sich nun aus,
Unser Straßenabitur.
In den Momenten ganz gewiss,
Dass das alles richtig ist
Der einzig ausgezahlte Lohn -
Ein Präsentkorb, euer Hohn!

Lass uns gehen, all das müssen
Wir hier gar nicht mehr verstehn
Lass uns gehen vollgepackt
Mit unseren Ideen
Lass uns gehen, trotz all der
Fehler werden wir zusammenstehen
Lass uns gehen, tief einatmen
Bevor alles vergeht

Stecken so viel von uns rein -
Ist das richtig? Wie wird's sein?
Für nichts ne Garantie -
Kein Problem, die gabs noch nie.
Und wir wissen, das ist klar,
Auch trotz starken Gegenwinds
Dass die steinigsten Wege,
Doch manchmal die Schönsten sind.

Lass uns gehen, all das müssen
Wir hier gar nicht mehr verstehn
Lass uns gehen vollgepackt
Mit unseren Ideen
Lass uns gehen, trotz all der
Fehler werden wir zusammenstehen
Lass uns gehen, tief einatmen
Bevor alles vergeht
Lass uns gehen, all das müssen

Lass uns gehen vollgepackt

Lass uns gehen, trotz all der
Fehler werden wir zusammenstehen
Lass uns gehen, tief einatmen
Bevor alles vergeht

Rettest die ganze Welt
Vergisst dabei einfach dich selbst
Kein Abschalten möglich
Was für eine Sucht, ständig bist du auf der Flucht
Find's schön was du bewegst
So viel kämpfst, so viel erlebst
Doch hat es keinen Wert, dass du so viel machst, wenn du am Ende nicht mehr lachst

Nimm dir endlich Zeit
Nimm dich endlich selber Ernst!
Wirst hier gar nichts mehr verändern, wenn du das Genießen verlernst
Nimm dir endlich Zeit
Nimm dich endlich selber Ernst!
Wirst hier gar nichts mehr verändern, wenn du das Genießen verlernst

Es fällt der weiße Schnee, bedienst jetzt jegliches Klischee
Warst immer gut im Verdrängen, doch bist du schlecht im Versagen
Hast du mir irgendwas zu sagen?
Die Probleme können jetzt warten
Weniger Worte, mehr Taten
Nutz die Ruhe, schau in dich hinein, sonst stehst du irgendwann allein

Nimm dir endlich Zeit
Nimm dich endlich selber Ernst!
Wirst hier gar nichts mehr verändern, wenn du das Genießen verlernst

In Leidenschaft bricht hier bald alles zusammen

Wir haben Probleme, wer hat die nicht?
Wir werden uns ändern, oder besser nicht
Zusammen am stärksten, zusammen geschweißt
Gegen all das Gerede von Glück und Zusammenhalt

Wir bilden Ketten, solange es brennt!
Ich werde immer daran denken, wie schön es zusammen mit dir ist!
Wir bilden Ketten, solange es brennt!
Es wird nicht einfach, wenn das Leben uns langsam zerfrisst

Ich bin durcheinander, du bist es auch
Wie geht's jetzt weiter? Wir lachen zu zweit
Sie wollen uns verwirren, und treten dabei
Mit ganzer Härte, auf alle unsere Träume ein!

Ich sitze am Fenster, hier neben dir
Regen prasselt an die Scheiben
Von früh bis spät
Alles andere egal, völlig scheißegal
Hauptsache du schläfst
Und deine Hände bleiben warm

Ich vergesse nie die Tage
Da draußen auf dem Meer
Ungewiss und ohne Schlaf
Das hast du nicht verdient
Ich vergesse nie die Tage
Da draußen auf dem Meer
Du warst so oft für mich da
Jetzt bin ich für dich hier

Komm wir dreh'n ne Runde auf Station
Das wird nicht einfach, nichts wie gewohnt
Die Geräte rauben die den Schlaf
Der Schmerz dringt in die Seele, ist völlig normal!

Ich vergesse nie die Tage
Da draußen auf dem Meer
Ungewiss und ohne Schlaf
Das hast du nicht verdient
Ich vergesse nie die Tage
Da draußen auf dem Meer
Du warst so oft für mich da
Jetzt bin ich für dich hier

Vollgepumpt mit ihren Drogen
Und der Schweiß in deinem Gesicht
Warum musst du denn so leiden
Ich hoffe, das das bald vergeht

Ich hab mich selten so gefühlt
Diese Leere bringt mich um
Das ist doch alles nicht gerecht
Wieso es immer die Besten trifft

Warten, warten
Warten auf das Meer

Warten, warten
Warten auf das Meer

Warten, warten
Warten auf das Meer

Warten, warten.

Niemand der ihnen Antwort gibt
Was können sie hier noch wagen
Heute Nacht - schlagen sie zurück!

Helme warten auf Kommando
Knüppel schlagen Köpfe ein
Wasser peitscht sie durch die Straßen
Niemand muss Bulle sein!

Und der Hass - Der steigt!
Und unsere Wut - Sie treibt!
Unsere Herzen brennen,
Unsere Herzen brennen!

Verweis mich aus der Stadt
Ich scheiß drauf was du sagst
Wer kein Rückgrat hat, der wird vereidigt auf den Staat.
Lieber Hartz 4 beziehn, im Bett bis um 4 liegen,
Bier trinken, Weed dealen, Speed ziehn,
Als Geld im Staatdienst verdien
Das Martinshorn in meinen Ohren nervt
Ich habe mir nichts vorzuwerfen
Bin bei weitem nicht frei von Sünde
Aber trte vor zum Werfen
Polizist sein heißt das Menschen mit Meinungen Feinde sind
Ihr verprügelt gerade wieder Kinder als wärens eure Eigenen
Ich trag lieber ein pinkes Designerhemd
Bettle am Bahnhof für ein paar Cent
Zieh lieber eine Line Zement als Down zu sein mit Rainer Wendt
Ich mach mich warm weil der Dunkelheitseinbruch sich nähert
Die nächste Bullenwache ist nur einen Steinwurf entfernt

Und der Hass - Der steigt!
Und unsere Wut - Sie treibt!
Unsere Herzen brennen,

Willst siegen, scheitern und verstehen
Die Scheiße war, bleibt und ist
Es endet mal wieder in der Tristesse

Hast kein Problem damit, auch lachend unterzugehen

Besoffen abhitlern, das kann ja mal passieren.

Ihr habt nichts gegen Schwarze und ihr habt nichts gegen Schwule
Ja da seid ihr euch gewiss, denn das lernt ihr in der Schule.
Ihr seid ach so tolerant, ihr seid achso reflektiert
Und wenn Ronny nicht schuftet, hofft ihr, dass er krepiert.

Heute wird geteilt was das Zeug hält
Deutschland ist scheiße, Deutschland ist Dreck!
Gib mir ein "like" gegen Deutschland
Deutschland ist scheiße, Deutschland ist Dreck!

Ständig nur Gelaber,
Ständig Phrasendräscherei,
Ach was seid ihr nur schockiert?
Ich nenne es nichts Heuchelei!
Wie konnte das nur passieren?,
Daß hätten wir niemals gedacht,
Wann haben denn die Faschos schonmal Menschen umgebracht?

Jetzt trauern wir in Talkshows,
Über Schreibtischtäter quatscht ihr nie,
Doch wer will es euch verübeln?,
Wer schießt sich schon ins eigene Knie?
Lichtenhagen, NSU, das alles war kein Zufall,
Das Problem das heißt Rassismus,
Doch das ist euch scheiß egal!

Schaut in unsere Augen, seht ihr die Entschlossenheit!
Bis hierhin und nicht weiter!
Es ist längst schon an der
Zeit!
Nazis morden weiter und der Staat schiebt fleißig ab,
Schaut in diese Augen und seht die Entschlossenheit!,
Bis hierhin und noch weiter, es ist längst schon an der Zeit,
Nazis morden weiter und der Staat schiebt fleißig ab!

Verfassungsschutz und Nazis gehen weiter Hand in Hand,
Noch ein Paar Reformen, schon sind alle froh in diesem Land,
Die einzige Erkenntnis, was mir noch dazu einfallt: Die schlechtesten Geschichten schreibt das Leben halt noch selbst!

Es ist und bleibt Schlussendlich das alte "Rassistenpack"!

Album  Scheitern und Verstehen
Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Weiß nicht wohin mit mir.
Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Keine Ahnung wie es weiter geht.

Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Zu viele Fragen stell ich mir.
Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Hab' hier wirklich nichts zu verlieren.

Kennst du das Gefühl wenn du nur Leere spürst?
Das Auf und Ab zwischen deinen Träumen und dem endlosen Fall.
Und in deinem Herzen tobt ein Aufstand zwischen Liebe und Hass.
Wann geh ich endlich diesen Weg der mich doch so glücklich macht?

Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Weiß nicht wohin mit mir.
Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Keine Ahnung wie es weiter geht.

Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Zu viele Fragen stell ich mir.
Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Hab' hier wirklich nichts zu verlieren.

Sie löchern mich mit ihren Fragen, auf die ich alle, keine Antwort weiß.
Mein radikales Nein zu dieser Welt ist es was mich stark und lebendig macht.
Ich liebe dich, ich liebe Freiheit und ich liebe meine Freunde,
Und ganz nebenbei belüg' ich mich auch noch selbst.

Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Weiß nicht wohin mit mir.
Ich bin komplett im Arsch,
Keine Ahnung wie es weiter geht.

Manchmal bin ich, einfach nur gut drauf
Manchmal bin ich, selten zu haus.
Manchmal bin ich, auch gerne alleine
Aber eigentlich will ich nur bei dir sein

Komm wir reichen uns die
Hand und wir werden schon sehen das die zeitlosen
Momente wirklich niemals vergehen es ist der eine
Augenblick dieses vertraute
Gefühl das unsere Träume irgendwann in Erfüllung gehen

Und du sagst es kotzt dich alles
Und du sagst du bleibst hier nicht mehr lang
Und du sagst was anders kenn ich kaum
Lass uns zusammen ein Luftschloss bauen

Komm wir reichen uns die
Hand und wir werden schon sehen das die zeitlosen
Momente wirklich niemals vergehen es ist der eine
Augenblick dieses vertraute Gefühl das unsere
Träume irgendwann in Erfüllung gehen

Komm wir reichen uns die Hand
Komm wir reichen uns die Hand

Komm wir reichen uns die
Hand und wir werden schon sehen das die zeitlosen
Momente wirklich niemals vergehen es ist der eine
Augenblick dieses vertraute Gefühl das unsere
Träume irgendwann in Erfüllung gehen

Komm wir reichen uns die Hand
Komm wir reichen uns die Hand
Komm wir reichen uns die Hand
Komm wir reichen uns die Hand

I'm not going to change my mind
I can't listen to your fuckin' lies
We stand together for a free life
We will never forgive
We will never forget!
I can't listen to your fuckin' lies
We stand together for a free life
We will never forgive

We will stay
We will fight -
Against the fascists

Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
A riot, a riot, a riot in my heart

This for all the comrades we lost
This is for their ideals and their dreams
This is a call to justice
We will never forgive
We will never forget!

We will stay
We will fight -
Against the fascists
Antifa unite!

Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart

Ich sitze hier mit Freunden, und fühle mich so wohl
Was es umso schöner macht, es liegt nicht nur am Alkohol.
So vertraut und abgefuckt - Ach, was finde ich das schön
Mit diesen Menschen hier kann es ewig so weitergehn'.

Ich genieße diese Zeit und speicher' all das ab
Was es umso schöner macht, das Ganze gibt mir verdammt viel Kraft.
Das hier gebe ich nicht mehr her, das ist einfach wunderschön
Heute Nacht werden wir lachend um die Häuser ziehn'.

Wir fliegen weit hinaus
Keine Grenzen im Kopf, nicht mal den Horizont
Wir schenken uns Kraft
Uns beflügelt die Freundschaft
Das ist das, was uns glücklich macht

Ich sitze hier mit Freunden, und fühle mich so wohl
Was es umso schöner macht, es liegt nicht nur am Alkohol.

Name  Weit hinaus
Artist  Feine Sahne Fischfilet
Album  Scheitern und Verstehen
Ja ich will leben - will nicht nur atmen
Nein ich will brennen, und es gibt nichts zu verlieren
Lieber drei Jahre Abenteuer
Als dreißig Jahre lang am Leben zu erfriern

Ja ich will leben - das heißt auch kämpfen
Gegen das Sterben - und das ist auch Teil von mir
Ja ich will leben - lebendig kämpfen
Ja ich will brennen - zusammen mit dir

Wir sind alle hier wie die Tiere
Domestiziert und eingesperrt
Und wir laufen ganz gut im Getriebe
Voll stummer Schreie, die keiner hört

Und wir erzählen uns schon, das hier wär das Leben
Doch hinterm Riegel fängt das Leben doch erst an
Und Leben ist mehr als ein Pulsschlag
Und ein paar Perlen zum Gesang

Und du hör auf, hör auf, mir zu erzählen
Es gibt nichts Anderes, viel zu lang hab ichs geglaubt
Du hast mich um meine Träume
Und meine Tränen so lang beraubt

Du hast mich um meine Träume
Und meine Tränen so lang beraubt

Frag dich selbst, bist du glücklich mit deinem Leben?
Ist das, was du machst, wirklich das, was du machen möchtest?
Sparst du Zeit, und wofür sparst du sie?
Wenn es einen Film über dein Leben gäbe, würdest du ihn anschauen, würde er dich faszinieren?

Sechs Euro für eine Stunde auf der Arbeit - was würdest du zahlen für eine Stunde an einem sonnigen Tag im Park?
Drei Kaffee auf der Raste kosten soviel wie eine Stunde deines Lebens!
Würdest du in deinem Leben etwas anders machen, wenn du wüsstest, dass du nächstes Jahr sterben würdest?
Wer sagt dir, dass du dann überhaupt noch lebst?
Jeder Moment Leben, der dir aus der Gegenwart geklaut wird, ist einer, der verloren sein wird für immer!
Hast du Ideen, oder haben Ideen dich?
Fühlst du dich auch manchmal auf eine bestimmte Art und Weise einsam, eine Art, die dich fast zerfrisst?
Fühlst du dich auch manchmal auf eine bestimmte Art und Weise einsam, auf eine Art, die Worte nicht beschreiben können?

Du bist dein Ticket aus diesem Käfig - du bist dein Ticket aus dieser Welt
Wir liegen alle in der Gosse - und voller Sterne ist die Welt
Wir liegen alle in der Gosse - und voller Sterne ist die Welt
Wir liegen alle in der Gosse - und voller Sterne ist die Welt

Album  Wut im Bauch Trauer im Herzen
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Blankenese
Die trug die Haare so, wie Jonathan Meese
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in der Hafencity
Die ging nachts los und bombte Graffitti
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Rothenburgsort
Sie brachte's mir bei das verbotene Wort
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Altona
Sie war wie der Winter kalt und klar

Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Hammerbrook
Erst digital dann analog
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Finkenwerder
Leider war auch jedes mal ihr alter Herr da
Ich liebte ein Mädchen auf St.Pauli
Sie mochte es am Liebsten, wenn ich ganz laut schrie
Doch dann wurde es mir in Hamburg zu klein
Und so zog ich in ganz Deutschland ein

Ich hab' sie alle geliebt
Rom, Berlin und Paris
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer
Ich hab sie alle geliebt
Rom, Berlin und Paris
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer

Ey, ich liebte ein Mädchen in Frankfurt, Oder
Wir fuhren durchs Land in ihrem alten Skoda
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Salzgitter
Ihr folgten mehr Jungs als dem Papst auf Twitter
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Eisenach
Leider hat sie auch die anderen beiden heiß gemacht
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Magdeburg
Ich tanzte mit ihr eine Nacht lang durch

Ich liebte ein Mädchen auf Helgoland
Sie war Königin der Insel, selbsternannt
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Köln
Auf dem Foto in der Küche sieht sie aus wie Katja Ebstein
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Schwerin
Sie war pleite, wie Berlin
Doch dann wurde es mir in Deutschland zu klein
Und so zog ich in die Welt hinein

Ich hab' sie alle geliebt
Rom, Berlin und Paris
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer
Ich hab sie alle geliebt
Rom, Berlin und Paris
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer

Für immer immer?
Für immer immer?
Für immer
Für immer immer? für immer immer

Ich liebte ein Mädchen in New York City
Sie liebte beide Pac und Biggy
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Rio de Janeiro
Eu quero te dar um beijo
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Istanbul
Dummerweise hielt sie mich für schwul
Ich liebte ein Mädchen in Madrid
Sie hat mehr geraucht als Helmut Schmidt

Ich hab' sie alle geliebt
Rom, Berlin und Paris
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer
Ich hab sie alle geliebt
Rom, Berlin und Paris
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer

Ich hab' sie alle geliebt
Rom, Berlin und Paris
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer
Irgendwie war es jedes Mal für immer

Album  3 is ne Party
Du hast nicht die leiseste Ahnung, kennst das alles nur vom Hörensagen
Wir ham einiges in Planung drauf kannst du Gift nehmen oder Björn fragen
Denn ich rap um mein Leben, kanns da was besseres geben
als die drei Harros von eben die das Niveau wieder heben
Die Vorurteile widerlegen bis der Knoten dann geplatzt ist
(Fuck this)
Ich hörte selten so etwas beknacktes
Wer wagt es und kommt mit mir bis in die Arktis,
wo wir dich burnen, dass du im Krematorium Rabatt kriegst
Weil mein Part der lodert, deiner klingt arg vermodert
Wir ham mit Styles die Charts erobert, die glänzen wie frisch gebohnert
Heiliger Strohsack! Das ist für manchen starker Tobak
Komm mit Bildern wie Kodak, komm bin der Mann für jede Tonart
Wenn ich bei mir zuhaus in meiner Plattenkiste stöber
bastel ich für Euch die Bombe und keinen lieblosen Scheiß
Viele Diddl ham euch jahrelang mit Rattengift geködert
Das kann euch nicht passieren wenn ich zum Mikrofon greif
Trennt sich die Spreu jetzt vom Weizen
Wie ich mich freue euch zu reizen
Verlier die Scheu hier zu geizen
denn wir sind neu und die geilsten
Schiff ahoi! Es schlägt dreizehn, denkst Du dir bei meiner Handarbeit
Dreh meine Joints nur vom Feinsten
da spricht bei Dir nur blanker Neid
Was wir heute produzieren wird erst in Jahren gecheckt
Doch ich will keine Dankbarkeit. Ich will Respekt
Keine Angst! Dies ist nur die Zukunft
Könnt ihr mich hören?

Flash Müller baut'n Haus für das neue Jahrtausend
Wo sind meine Leute da draußen?
Kaybee Baby pflanzt'n Baum für das neue Jahrtausend
Wo sind meine Leute da draußen?
Rektor Donz zeugt'n Kind für das neue Jahrtausend
Wo sind meine Leute da draußen?
Uns're Fans sind die Größten, die Schönsten, die Schlausten

Yeah, jetzt bekommst du von Hip-Hops Schwiegersohn deine letzte Chance
Nix ist mehr wie gewohnt, überschätzte Schnomps wurden ja eh nie geschont
Raps par excellence, Rektor Donz ist am Mikrofon
Ich bin der letzte der geht, wenn alle anderen walken
bin der letzte der spricht, wenn alle anderen talken
Manchmal macht mir diese Scheiße echt Sorgen
Viele Flaschen können den Hals nicht vollkriegen
Hier kommt endlich der Korken
Schönen guten Morgen an all die Banausen da draußen
Ich verteil erstmal 'n paar gute Ratschläge
in punkto Tüchtigkeit und Ordnung setz ich hier die Maßstäbe
weil ich tüchtig gasgebe und ordentlich arschtrete, ey
Wer wenn nicht wir, wo wenn nicht hier
wann wenn nicht grad, wie wenn nicht hart
Selbst Onkel Punkrock geht nach unserer Show am Stock
Drei kleine Scheißer laufen Amok mit'm Rammbock
Hamburgs Hip-Hop-Dinosaurier 92er Baujahr laden ein auf die tollere Party
Auja, wir machen schön ein' auf dicke Hose wie Oliver Hardy
und riskieren 'ne dicke Lippe wie Lollo Ferrari
Mäuschen sag mal Hip, sag mal Hop
sag mal Fettes Brot, oh mein Gott, don't stop
Sag mal wie heißt dieses Showtalent im weißen Oberhemd?
Für sie immer noch Herr Vorragend!

Flash Müller baut'n Haus für das neue Jahrtausend
Wo sind meine Leute da draußen?
Kaybee Baby pflanzt'n Baum für das neue Jahrtausend
Wo sind meine Leute da draußen?
Rektor Donz zeugt'n Kind für das neue Jahrtausend
Wo sind meine Leute da draußen?
Uns're Fans sind die Größten, die Schönsten, die Schlausten
Wo sind meine Leute da draußen?

Die Leute liegen auf der Lauer, denn sie finden unsere Tape gut
Die anderen Bauern werden sauer wie 'ne Grapefruit
denn sie wissen ganz genau auf unserem Tanzboden klebt Blut
denn Fettes Brot geht immer dahin wo es weh tut
Doch mach mal halb lang, Alter, ist doch noch kein Grund zum schreien
Setz einen Helm auf, spann die Muskeln an, Mundschutz rein
nur für den Fall
Denn wenn das ganze Land zu unser Platte nickt
"kann es gut sein," dass Fettes Brot dich auf die Matte schickt
Denn Du Spacken verstummst, wenn ich wie kein zweiter abstyle
mit Backen wie Mumps bei jeder weiteren Zeile
Das ist packende Kunst an der auch weiterhin feile
weil so alles begann und uns gibt seither ne' Weile
Also, Keule, denk nach über ein Neuanfang
weil selbst erfrorene Ohren Feuer fangen bei unserem Schleudergang
So sieht es aus, auch wenn Du die Wahrheit nicht abkannst
bei uns ist jeder Laden voll, da kriegst Du Schlappschwanz Platzangst
Überall lassen wir die Korken knallen Kollegen
Da kennen wir wirklich nichts, das steht in allen Verträgen
Und damit niemand schubst, schwitzt und sich alle bewegen
müssen Klubs unsere Gigs in große Hallen verlegen
Denn wenn wir 'ne neue Platte aufnehmen damit auftreten und aufdrehen
erregen wir aller Ortens ungeahntes Aufsehen
Bei uns bleibt alles in Bewegung und wir ändern den Kurs nicht
denn wir sind immer noch durstig

Ey, wo sind meine Leute da draussen?

Drei Hamburger mit'm Monster-Bass
saßen auf der Straße und erzählt'n euch das
da kam die Polizei und fragte sonst noch was?

Vielleicht bin ich
Ja ohne das
Auch mal was
Vielleicht mit dem da
Oder diesem hier

Ich weiß ich bin
Ja ohne das
Nicht mal was
Halbgar bejaht
Ist das echt wahr
Dass du jetzt gehst
Ich kanns verstehen

Finstre nacht
Schwarz wie samt
Flüstert dir ins ohr

Wohin des wegs?
Noch nicht ganz
Am boden angekommen

Finstre nacht
Schwarz wie samt
Darauf kann ich bauen

Fieberhaft
Und doch allein
Im überfüllten raum

Zu alter form
Zurückzukehren
Als ob nichts wär
Ist viel zu schwer

Besser mütze tragen
Wenn die sonne explodiert

Suche dinge die gut sind
Um sie zu meiden
Schaff es nicht
Erinnerungen zu überschreiben
Brauch mehr verständnis zum vertrauen
Und mehr vertrauen zum verstehen
Beim wagen scheitern
Heisst nicht verlieren
Bin scheissgut informiert
Chapeau
Ich bin kaputtanalysiert

Ohne dich sind wir nichts
Ohne dich bist du nichts

Ziffernblatt erschlägt
Geh tausend jahre vorwärts
Kein plan wohin
Verdammt nochmal
Ich such nur da
Wo ich mich find
Auf dem schnappschuss
Bin ich

Geflügelt

Und alsbald
Werden wir zurechtgerückt
Zu den fanfaren
Die nächte überbrückt
Wirst du bezahlen
Für jeden fingerzeig
Bist dir im klaren
Da kommt nichts mehr

Und alsbald
Wird alles anders

Du hast gesagt du packst das
Du hast gesagt das packt dich nicht
Auch wenn die gier, auch wenn der hunger
Dich in kleinen scheiben frisst

Du kennst den kurs nur allzu gut
Wirkst bedacht von kopf bis fuß
Stapelst tief und setzt auf klein

Du fragst dich nach relevanz
Schiebst figuren, auf dass es passt
Denn du kannst
Denn es langt

Wahnsinn hör mich an jetzt
Sieh hier hin und sprichs mir endlich ab

Du bist dreck, ein maul voll pappe
Kopf auf tisch und hammer drauf
Es fühlt sich richtig an

Du gehörst gehört
Gehörst versenkt
Gehörst verdammt weit weggestellt
Es hängt ein mensch noch dran

Mit nassen augen, leise
Verdient in keinster weise

Kommt viel zurück?

Spricht für sich
Auf eigne faust
So drauf erpicht
Protestgeschrei
Du wirst dich zwingen
Stets wohlnotiert
Wie das grad ging

In 3, 4, 5, 6 jahren
Noch 3, 4, 5, 6 mal
Fingernägel weg
Nurnoch blut geschmeckt

In 3, 4, 5, 6 jahren
Noch 3, 4, 5, 6 mal
Keinen schlaf gewohnt
Für den höchsten ton

Was keiner denkt
In jedem moment
Groß eingelenkt
Das letzte hemd
Die essenz
Barfuß gekämpft
So viel gestemmt
Ungehemmt grenzen gesprengt

Was dich erhebt
Ist nicht wo du bist
Wie gut du es triffst
Kein wort der exzellenz
Sag mir nur

Was musstest du bezwingen

Und wenn das nicht passt
Kannst du ja gehen

Liebe dich statt mich
Mit ohne sinn
Schreibs auf, quetschs aus
Nehm das gute daraus

Das ist nicht was du denkst
Das ist nicht was du meinst
Das ist nicht was es sein
Kann

Schlafe ein
Unter rieselei
Gib mir doch die zeit

Asche verteilt
Über habseligkeit
Kann das was sein

Revidiert
Unterm strich rentiert
Sich das nie im leben

Ich geh dann jetzt

Hand und fuß
Wird gesucht
Mit ringenden händen
Schlägts falsch herum aus
Das ist hausgemacht
Du brauchst halt was
Welches wortgewand
Gibt dir kraft und halt und stand

Zähneknirschen
Funkenschlag
Geb mein bestes
Aber davon zu viel

Kommt da nichts
Oder

Das ist nicht was du denkst
Das ist nicht was du meinst
Das ist nicht was es sein
Nicht was du sein

Festgepresst

Machst du dies hier zu deinem
Formidabel ausgespielt
Machst du dir das hier zu eigen
Große worte helfen viel

Aus zwei tönen
Synfonien gestrickt
Und die freiheit
In 16 zeilen belegt
Ein bild von dir gemalt
Und mit allem was du hast
Dafür bezahlt

Das ist alles was mir bleibt
Ja ja ja
Ich kann alles
Will alles
Werd alles
Was es gibt

Nichts von dir bleibt
Lichtgestalt, es ist zeit

Das regelwerk
Phänomenal
Optimier
Doch hier nochmal
Denn da ist noch luft nach oben

Sie bleiben
Hinter den scheiben
Du hast kein gesicht
Dein wort kein gewicht
Du kannst so viel
Und wirst doch nichts

Hab zu häufig das Falsche gewählt

Hab deine Tränen gespürt
Und am Ende war alles still

Ich hab das Lachen gehört
Und hab den Wahnsinn probiert
Hab deine Tränen gespürt

Ich habe Feste gefeiert
Doch dann war mir die Gesellschaft zu dumm
Ich saß alleine im Zimmer

Ich hab das Lachen gehört
Und hab den Wahnsinn probiert

Die Uhr schlägt einsam ins Leere
Herzen sind schwer
Die Engel sind am Verlieren
Zu beten lohnt sich nicht mehr
Einer steht auf dem Dach
Schreit wirre Reden hinaus
Verbeugt sich tief und schweigt dann
Der Regen spendet Appplaus

Umkreisen und warten
Der Stachel sitzt tief
Erlebe Tage und Nächte
Ohne jeden Unterschied
Straßen ziehen sich wie Narben
Endlos durch die Stadt
Fahles Licht, blasse Farben
Und hin und wieder der Mond

Ich bin ein Satellit
Bleibe niemals stehn
Umkreisen und warten
Quelle der Manie

Ich bin ein Satellit
Der nicht näher kommt
Nur betrunkene Sehnsucht
Und hin und wieder der Mond

Jeden Tag verkauft
Das Hier und jetzt ist zu laut
Am Himmel stehen Sternenleichen
Und hier unten lebt auch nicht all zu viel

In die neue Zeit
Das Hier und Jetzt ist zu eng
Es ist ganz egal wohin
Kein König, keine Königin

Hinter der Zeit
Eine Zukunft gejagt
Immer bereit
Für einen anderen Tag

Voll Lust und Leidenschaft
Duft von Land und Meer und Haut
In Armen versinken
Fremd wie das Paradies

Regen fällt
Erfrischend und kühl
Fremde Welt
Ein neues Gefühl

Alles ist gut
Am Morgen danach
Man ist nicht allein
Am Morgen danach

Niemals zurück
Romantik ist Sehnsucht
Ein Feuer brennt hell und warm
Und am Himmel stehen Sternenleichen

Hinter der Zeit
Eine Zukunft gejagt
Immer bereit
Für einen anderen Tag

Alles ist gut
Am Morgen danach
Man ist nicht allein
Am Morgen danach

Trolle und Elfen rannten eiskalt ins Verderben
Die Märchenstunde ist längst vorbei
Das Wissen ums Geschehen
Jagt Torpedos ins Gehirn
Das Gemüt hängt an der Kette, die du rauchst

Voraus erhebt sich stolz ein mächtiger Turm
Doch sein Standbild ist nur Lug und Trug
Denn nach unten wird man drinnen
Statt nach oben geführt
Dort werde ich nicht sein und Dich nicht finden

Ich saß in einem Raum und mußte warten
Zwischen allen anderen im Abseits
Nichts hält mehr warm
An diesen verhangenen Tagen
Vor dem Fenster zieht Dunkelheit vorbei

Halte mich warm
An diesen verhangenen Tagen
Hoffen und glauben
Oder alle Träume rauben

Halte mich warm
An diesen verhangenen Tagen
Hoffen und glauben
Oder alle Träume rauben

Inneres Feuer aus Wut und Verletzung
Gemütswelt ist ein Trümmerfeld
So oft nicht zurechtgefunden
Ein Zug rast in den Tunnel
Ein Geschoß jagt durch den Lauf

Ich saß in einem Raum und mußt warten
Zwischen allen anderen im Abseits
Katastrophen treffen Lebende mit vollem Gewicht
Vor dem Fenster zieht die Dunkelheit vorbei

Halte mich warm
An diesen verhangenen Tagen
Hoffen und glauben
Oder alle Träume rauben

Halte mich warm
An diesen verhangenen Tagen
Hoffen und glauben
Oder alle Träume rauben

Halte mich warm
An diesen verhangenen Tagen

Look at me, look at me
Hands in the air like it's good to be
Alive, and I'm a famous rapper
Even when the paths are all crookedy

I can show you how to do-si-do
I can show you how to scratch a record
I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together

I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to "De Colores"
And "I'm Proud to Be an American"

Me and my friend saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took
I can do anything that I want, 'cause, look

I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome
No metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone
On the telephone

Look at me, look at me
Just called to say that it's good to be
Alive in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read

I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a livin' off a magazine
I can design an engine
Sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline

I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions,
I know how to run the business
And I can make you wanna buy a product

Movers, shakers and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the system
I can do anything with no resistance

'Cause I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone
With a microphone
And I can split the atoms of a molecule
Of a molecule
Of a molecule

Look at me, look at me
Drivin' and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top
My reach, is global
My tower, secure
My cause, is noble
My power, is pure

I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let 'em all die of exasperation
Have 'em all healed of their lacerations
Have 'em all killed by assassination

I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because

I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite
By satellite
And I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope
Through a telescope

And I can end the planet in a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust

I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars
No handlebars
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars
No handlebars

There's a war going on for your mind
Media mavens mount surgical strikes from Trapper Keeper collages and online magazine racks
Cover girl cutouts throw up pop-up ads
Infecting victims with silicone shrapnel
Worldwide passenger pigeons deploy paratroopers
Now it's raining pornography
Lovers take shelter
Post-production debutantes pursue you in Nascar chariots
They construct ransom letters from biblical passages and bleed mascara into holy water supplies

There's a war going on for your mind
Industry insiders slave test tube babies to corporate crackheads
They flash logos and blast ghettos
Their embroidered neckties say "stop snitchin'"
Conscious rappers and whistleblowers get stitches made of acupuncture needles and marionette strings

There is a war going on for your mind
Professional wrestlers and vice presidents want you to believe them
The desert sky is their bluescreen
They superimpose explosions
They shout at you
"Pay no attention to the men behind the barbed curtain
Nor the craters beneath the draped flags
Those hoods are there for your protection
And meteors these days are the size of corpses"

There's a war going on for your mind
We are the insurgents

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense
Spinning infinity, but
The wheel is spinning me
It's neverending, neverending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

In time, or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent
We're temporary, temporary

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender? Oh

I'm the voice inside your head you refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?

This indecision got me climbing up the wall
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall
How could this come over me, thought I was above it all
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

(Choke!)
On our kiss, thought I'd save my breath for you
(Choke!)
On our kiss, thought I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope, I'm coming loose
I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope, I'm coming loose
I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope, I'm coming out of my head, into the clear
When you go, I come loose

These premonitions got me crying up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

(Choke!)
On our kiss, thought I'd save my breath for you

Mit dir steht die Zeit still. Du bist was ich will
Spürst du was ich fühl', denn was ich fühl' ist real
Es ist mehr als nur ein Spiel, ich lieb' deinen Stil
Dein Sexappeal. Komm' relax mit mir
Ich will nichts tun was du später mal bereu'n wirst
Doch heut' nacht brauch' ich bisschen mehr als Freundschaft
Bitte schau' mich nicht so an, deine Blicke sind gefährlich
Uuh ehrlich, ich begehr' dich

Mit dir steht die Zeit still. Du verwirrst mich
Bist zuviel für mich. Spür' wie du mein' Willen brichst
Ist es mehr als nur ein Spiel? Leg' die Karten auf den Tisch
Meinst du ich bleib' kühl wenn du bei mir bist?
Ich will nichts tun was ich später mal bereu'n werd'
Doch heut' nacht brauch ich bisschen mehr als Freundschaft
Deine Küsse machen süchtig nimm Rücksicht
Ich weiß du bist berüchtigt

Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher
Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher

Baby, Baby, du bist smooth wie Kamasutra
... pschhht - sonst hört uns deine Mutter
Denk' nicht ich sei unverwundbar

Baby, meinst du nicht dass wir zu weit geh'n?
Wird das mehr als nur ein One-Night-Stand
Oder willst du mich nur haben, um dein' hom's davon zu erzähl'n?

Mit dir bleibt die Welt steh'n
Denk' nicht, dass wir uns nicht wiederseh'n wenn sie sich morgen weiterdreht
Ich weiß es ist schon spät, soll ich lieber geh'n
Oder bei dir bleiben? Du bist mehr als nur mein Zeitvertreib
Ist es Einsamkeit die aus deinen Augen spricht
Lass' die Zweifel sein und genieß' den Augenblick
Auch ich brauch' dich
Es ist unglaublich wie sehr du mir vertraut bist

Mit dir bleibt die Welt steh'n
Werden wir uns wiederseh'n wenn sie sich morgen weiterdreht?
Ich weiß es ist spät, weiß nicht was ich mach'
Denn ich will deine Leidenschaft nicht nur für die eine Nacht
Ist es Liebe die aus deinen Augen spricht?
Zumindest spür' ich sie im Augenblick
Auch ich brauch' dich
Es ist erstaunlich wie sehr du mir vertraut bist

Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher
Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher
Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher

Baby Baby, seitdem ich dich geseh'n hab'
Hab' ich gespürt dass es passieren wird
Was wir tun kann nicht falsch sein
Es ist mehr als du vielleicht meinst

Baby, suchst du nur nach Abenteuern?
Spiel' nicht mit dem Feuer
Denn ich will mich nicht verbrennen
Keine Ahnung was du Liebe nennst

Mit dir steht die Zeit still. Du bist was ich will
Spürst du was ich fühl', denn was ich fühl' is real
Es ist mehr als nur ein Spiel. Ich lieb' deinen Stil
Dein Sexappeal. Komm' relax mit mir
Will nichts tun was ich später mal bereu'n werd'
Doch heut' nacht brauch' ich bisschen mehr als Freundschaft
Deine Küsse machen süchtig, nimm Rücksicht
Ich weiß du bist berüchtigt

Baby baby, du siehst schön aus im Schlaf
Ich komm wieder wenn ich darf
Will dich nicht wecken schreib' dir 'n Zettel
Bevor ich weg geh', Babe

Baby, küss' mich wach
Ich begrüß' den Tag. Schenk' dir 'n Lächeln
Will dich checken bevor du weg gehst, Babe

Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher
Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher
Komm' her, komm' her
Komm' näher, komm' näher

Es war ne laue Nacht
Du weißt es noch genau
Als ob es gestern war
Du warst ein bisschen drauf
Und hattest vorgetrunken
Wodka mit deinen Freunden
Seid durch die Nacht gestreunt
Um 9 habt ihr euch reingeschlichen
Ihr wart die größten Fans
Von Torsun und den Jungs
Und in der ersten Reihe kanntet wirklich alle Songs
Doch auch die Vorband taugte
Was dir noch mehr gefiel
War dieses Mädchen ja sie war besonders hatte Stil
Du hast sie angesprochen
Sagtest neckisch "ey Katze, hab dich noch nie gesehn"
"ey Kater, bin da wegen Bratze"
Sie fänd die Texte toll und die 2 Typen lustig
Wolltest ihr was spendieren aber hattest dann nur den Fuffi
Der reichen sollte für die nächsten 20 Tage
Hast ihr 'nen Drink geholt aber sie sagte "Schade
Ich hätt so gern das Shirt das es da bei Lars zu kaufen gibt,
Das schwarz-gelbe da, das schöne Shirt von Audiolith"
Doch sie sei leider pleite, hätt von ihrem letzten Geld
Die Karte heut gekauft da hast du es geholt und warst ihr Held
Ihr habt dann noch getanzt bis sie nach Hause ging
Und du zurückbliebst mit den Jungs die auf der Couch rumhingen

Du kaufst der Frau die du liebst
Ein Shirt von Audiolith
Das sie auch laufend anzieht
Weil es da draußen nichts gibt
Wie dieses Shirt von Audiolith
Mit den schönen großen Buchstaben

Du kaufst der Frau die du liebst

Am nächsten tag schon morgens warst du sehr aufgeregt
Du hast sie angerufen und fast wieder aufgelegt
Weil erst ihr Vater dran war, doch der war äußerst freundlich
Dann habt ihr lang geredet und gemerkt dass da so Zeug ist
Das ihr gemeinsam habt, ihr habt euch bald getroffen
Ihr wart sofort ein Paar und beide auch für alles offen
Ihr gingt auf jede Party und auf viele Konzerte
Demos oder Festivals, das Leben war die Oberhärte
Hauptsache Audiolith, habt alles abgefeiert und sie trug immer dieses Shirt
Es stand ihr ausgezeichnet
Ihr seid viel Zug gefahren, immer war richtig Trubel
Und einmal traft ihr in der Regionalbahn Frittenbude
Sie haben euch eingeladen, mit aufs Konzert genommen
Habt die Nacht durchgetanzt seid einfach nicht nach Haus gekommen
So ging das ein paar Jahre, ihr habt euch sehr geliebt
Und umso mehr verletzt wenns plötzlich einfach nichts mehr gibt
Und auch das Lieblingsshirt es war auf einmal weg
Es wurde tränenreich eure Liebe war wie zwei Schwäne
Oder zumindest ähnlich weil du extrem verletzt warst
Wolltest du sie nicht mehr sehen, du bist geblieben
Und sie musste gehen

Das Shirt von Audiolith
War wie die Frau die du liebst
Plötzlich verschwunden und du allein zuhause
Es blieb dir nichts als pausenlos diese Audiolithlieder
Und Bilder mit Katze

Die Jahre gingen ins Land, du wurdest immer älter
Die Mädels kamen, blieben, gingen, Blumen wurden welker
Hast etwas Geld gespart für eine neue Couch
Die alte dann zerlegt und was tauchte da plötzlich auf
Ganz hinten drin im Eck hast nicht geglaubt es liegt da dieses shirt
Dieses eine shirt von Audiolith
Du denkst zurück an die Momente deiner Jugend
Die Zeit war super nur ihr beide und die Musik
Du wirfst die Mühle an, tippst ihren Namen rein
Hast sie dann gleich gefunden in nem Netzwerk kann das sein?
Das ist sie wirklich nein, bist plötzlich sehr verwirrt
Machst ein foto von dem Shirt nicht von dir
Und schickst es ihr

Aus einem Moment wird ein Lied
in dem wir lachen und weinen,
wir können nicht viel,
reihen uns nicht ein und verneinen,
jeden Tag mindestens eine Frage,
die wir nicht verstehen.
Sehen uns solang in die Augen,
bis wir uns nicht mehr sehen.
Und verdrehen uns den Kopf immer wieder.
Sie verdreht dir den kopf immer wieder.
Er bringt dein Herz immer wieder zum beben.
Am Ende haben wir nichts,
nur der Welt ein paar Lieder gegeben.
Bevor wir uns ausreichend Zeit nehmen,
ordentlich niederzugehen.
Schnell intensiv, immer impulsiv,
immer wieder Wiederholung,
Immer wieder wir allein, in dieser Wohnung,
bis wir draußen sind. Wo die andern sind,
wie die andern sind wir nicht und nie gewesen.
Sonne, Mond und Sterni,
bis wir alle zusammen gemeinsam untergehen.
Alle allein und einsam.

Und um uns so aufregende Farben wie grün und blau
Und in uns so aufregende Farben wie Tiefschwarz und Grau
Und über uns so aufregende Farben wie Gelb und Rot
Und unter uns so aufregende Farben wie Blau und Bordeaux

Und um uns so aufregende farben wie Grün und Blau.
Und in euch so aufregende Farben wie Braun und Grau.
Und über uns so aufregende Farben Gelb und Rot.
Und unter uns so aufregende Farben Blau und Bordeaux.

Da sie uns nie verstehen werden,
lassen wir sie ziehen,
lassen wir sie sein, wir fallen ein,
wie die Tore der Empfindlichkeit,
vor unseren Augen, kaum zu glauben,
das wir so Blau sind,
wir tauchen auf und saugen alles aus,
saugen alles auf,
tauchen ein und atmen aus,
laufen ein und schlagen auch, unsere (?) weiter,
da Deutschland immer Deutschland bleibt,
sind wir stets bereit zu scheitern.
Leider weiß es wird verkentert (?)
auf dem Meer das uns verkennt.
Wir haben keine Zeit verschwendet, wie unsere Jugend,
unser Leben, unsere Tugenden, all unsere Fehler.
Immer ein bisschen zu laut, immer so sehr überdreht,
oft auch so leise, so überlegt.
Wie überleben wir uns und unsere Welt?
Keiner kann uns zertstören, außer wir selbst.
Und plötzlich ist alles gar nicht mehr so schwer,
alles gar nicht mehr so verworren.
Jetzt sind wir weiter als vorher,
doch haben soviel verloren.

Und um uns so aufregende Farben wie Grün und Blau
Und in uns so aufregende Farben wie Tiefschwarz und Grau
Und über uns so aufregende Farben wie Gelb und Rot
Und unter uns so aufregende Farben wie Blau und Bordeaux

Und um uns so aufregende farben wie Grün und Blau.
Und in euch so aufregende Farben wie Braun und Grau.
Und über uns so aufregende Farben Gelb und Rot.
Und unter uns so aufregende Farben Blau und Bordeaux.

Es ist wie oben zu sein
und nach unten zu fliegen
es ist überall unzufrieden
überall unzufrieden
sieben mal alles zu spüren
und es zusammen zu flicken
gegen etwas zu sein
und es zusammen zu ficken
es ist wie Liebe für immer
es ist geblieben nur dünner
es verkümmert noch schlimmer
und dabei unverkümmert
aber binnen Sekunden
ist das Zeichen entfernt
vorbei und verschwunden
es ist zu weit entfernt
aber zu greifen nichtmehr möglich
??? unverzüglich
wann kommt es wieder zurück?
wann kànn es wieder zurück?

Wir sind die Clowns
Im Zirkus des Lebens
Alle Träume ein Zelt
Und die Domteure Propheten
Besoffen an uns selbst
Auf diesem blauen Planten
Hat jede Flucht ein Gehäge
Ist jeder Club die Manege

Es ist wie unten zu sein
und nach oben zu steigen
es ist verloren meist
unausgewogen wie Zeiten des Leidens
und aufgehoben wie Geigen
für diesen einen Moment
um unkosequent aufzuboren
und konsequent auf den Boden
maßlos zu überspannen
wie diese Landungsbrücken
über die wir rannten
als wir raus waren
und so sehr danaben
nicht im Stande
uns zu leben
doch so weit davon entfernt
uns dabei auch zu geben
es gab nie ein dagegen
nur unser klangheimliches Elend
und es fand uns wieder zum Glück
fand es wieder zu uns zurück

Wir sind die Clowns
Im Zirkus des Lebens
Alle Träume ein Zelt
Und die Domteure Propheten
Besoffen an uns selbst
Auf diesem blauen Planten
Hat jede Flucht ein Gehäge
Ist jeder Club die Manege

gehts oder gehts
Jeder bei Lars sagt ein Witz
Der Applaus ist vergebens
Und der Fall ohne Netz
während man stolpert und fällt
bei diesem Seiltanz am Boden
ist der Erfolg nur Jonglage
und jeder Salto verlogen

Sie laufen nackt
Durch den prasselnden Regen
Und springen nachts
Von der Brücke ins Wasser

Sie mal'n die Metro in Madrid
Und tanzen barfuß in Ferropolis;
3 Tage im Jahr
Auf dem blubbernden Pflaster

Sie schmuggeln ein bisschen Spaß in den Bundestag
Knäulen dann zu dritt in der Kuppel
Und feiern anschließend Abschied vom Paradies
In der Bar, mit all den anderen Druffies

Sie sitzen blinzelnd in der Sonne, unten am Fluss
Da wo die Andern nie hingehn'
Und werfen non-stop die Scheiße weiter
In der sie tiefer als bis zu den Knien drin' stehn'

Sie liegen sich in den Armen, unterm' Koloss von Rhodos
Und schmeißen Steine auf Wannen
Gehn' gemeinsam durch Mordor
Und fragen sich eben deswegen:
War das nicht der beste Tag meines Lebens?

Der beste Tag deines Lebens
Der beste Tag meines Lebens
Jeder Tag ist der beste Tag eines Lebens
Der beste Tag deines Lebens
Der beste Tag meines Lebens
Jeder Tag ist der beste Tag eines Lebens

Sie halten sich so fest, Hand in Hand
Durch ein ganzes Land hindurchgerannt
Sie sehn' ein Wunder und dann
Tanzen sie vermummt hinein in den Mohn
Pflanzen ein paar Pflanzen im Nirgendwo
Ziehn' dort ein, wo keiner mehr wohnt

Sie geben heute keinen Fick und machen sich um morgen Sorgen
Jeder sein eigener Flick, sein eigener Reißer
Es ist vorbei-bei, unverblümt, unvertont
Die Melodien der Ironie im Unterton

Sie baun' Baumhäuser in die Stadt und
Zeitmaschinen aus Müll
Den Rest machen sie dann irgendwann
Wenn nur auf ein Gefühl

Auf einem Skateboard durchs Leben
Trotzdem etwas erreicht
Gegen jede Prophezeiung
Nicht nur etwas gefeit

Schon lang nicht mehr so glücklich
Doch noch das Abi gemacht
Sie sitzen auf ihrem Teppich
Und fliegen hinab in die Nacht

Der beste Tag deines Lebens
Der beste Tag meines Lebens
Jeder Tag ist der beste Tag eines Lebens
Der beste Tag deines Lebens
Der beste Tag meines Lebens
Jeder Tag ist der beste Tag eines Lebens

Ist das nun alles schwarz-weiß oder war es sehr bunt?
Es ist nicht klug oder schlau, es geht um laut oder stumm
Und auch um ja oder nein, es geht um Mensch oder Maus
Es ist tagaus und tagein, einfach tagein und tagaus

Wie dieser Marathonlauf, um den Platz an der Sonne
Und wir tragen ihn aus, auch wenn wir niemals ankommen
Wir schlagen uns auch dazu die Nacht um die Ohren
Um nicht zu vergessen, zu wissen, sonst geht alles verloren

Wir haben es schon vor jenen Jahren gewusst
Dass es das hier und das jetzt ist, der erhabene Schluss
Der für uns die Welt ist, der für uns das Zelt
Und das fällt nicht mal so sehr aus dem Rahmen wie wir immer dachten

Es ist alles ganz einfach, kein Drama
Da ist er, der Wind, die Möglichkeit eines Lamas
Die nächste Phase, der nächste Abschnitt
Dieser endlosen Straße

Diese Straße, sie führt dich irgendwo hin
Vielleicht führt sie dich aber auch nirgendwo hin
Aber nirgendwo muss ja auch irgendwo sein
Und irgendwann findet jeder mal Heim, jeder mal Heim

Wir sind nicht immer dagegen, aber auch selten dafür
Was helfen uns Worte und Reden, man muss das Leben schon spüren
Wir wollen mehr als euch lieb ist und geben mehr als wir können
Wir sind erst wirklich zufrieden, wenn wir durchbrechen

Wenn wir ausbrechen, wir drängen hinaus
Wir laufen hinab und rennen hinauf
Auf dem vom Tag warmen Dach über der schlafenden Stadt
Sind wir gelegen und träumten, was ist davon geblieben?

Wir wollten das Leben erleben, alle Monster und Riesen
Im Armdrücken besiegen bis die Sonne uns auffrisst
Und am Ende ein Meer
Diese Straße ist alles, diese Straße ist mehr

Mehr als schwarz-weiß, mehr als nur Teer
Mehr als schwarz-weiß, mehr als nur Teer

Tage, Jahre, fahren vorbei
Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre
(Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre)

Diese Straße, sie führt dich irgendwo hin
Vielleicht führt sie dich aber auch nirgendwo hin
Aber nirgendwo muss ja auch irgendwo sein
Und irgendwann findet jeder mal Heim, jeder mal Heim

Diese Straße, sie führt dich irgendwo hin
Vielleicht führt sie dich aber auch nirgendwo hin
Aber nirgendwo muss ja auch irgendwo sein
Und irgendwann findet jeder mal Heim, jeder mal Heim

Dabei stehst du dir gut
Und du brauchst nicht viel mehr

Youtube hat uns belogen
Und wir brauchen nichts mehr
Wir brauchen nurmehr Drogen
Du bist nicht wie du aussiehst
Ist dieser Spiegel gebogen
Erst hast du im Nest gekauert
Dann bist du geflogen

Es ist nichts wie es aussieht
Keiner kann sich mehr tarnen
Sie sind uniformiert
Uninformiert mit ihren Fahnen
Du bist nicht wie du aussiehst
Du bist immer noch da
Schön das es dich gibt
Wir sind immer noch da
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht
Wir brauchen den Auftrieb
Wir tauchen auf wie ein
Haufen rauchender Haufen.
Du bist nicht wie du aussiehst
Alles ist gut
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht

Alles wird gut

Es ist nichts wie es aussieht
Du bist nicht wie du aussiehst
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht
Menschen sind manipuliert
Wir sind ein bisschen verwirrt
Und auch ein bisschen verirrt
Du bist nicht wie du aussiehst
Keiner hat dich gekriegt
Du bist wie du bist
Und wir haben dich lieb
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht
Es gibt keinen Ausstieg
Wir werden nicht aufgeben
Wenn du dich nicht aufgibst
Du siehst gut aus
In deinem roten Kleid

Tanzend im Mondschein
Endlich ist es soweit
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht
Du bist nicht wie du aussiehst

Ist das nun alles schwarz-weiß oder war es sehr bunt?
Es ist nicht klug oder schlau, es geht um laut oder stumm
Und auch um ja oder nein, es geht um Mensch oder Maus
Es ist tagaus und tagein, einfach tagein und tagaus

Wie dieser Marathonlauf, um den Platz an der Sonne
Und wir tragen ihn aus, auch wenn wir niemals ankommen
Wir schlagen uns auch dazu die Nacht um die Ohren
Um nicht zu vergessen, zu wissen, sonst geht alles verloren

Wir haben es schon vor jenen Jahren gewusst
Dass es das hier und das jetzt ist, der erhabene Schluss
Der für uns die Welt ist, der für uns das Zelt
Und das fällt nicht mal so sehr aus dem Rahmen wie wir immer dachten

Es ist alles ganz einfach, kein Drama
Da ist er, der Wind, die Möglichkeit eines Lamas
Die nächste Phase, der nächste Abschnitt
Dieser endlosen Straße

Diese Straße, sie führt dich irgendwo hin
Vielleicht führt sie dich aber auch nirgendwo hin
Aber nirgendwo muss ja auch irgendwo sein
Und irgendwann findet jeder mal Heim, jeder mal Heim

Wir sind nicht immer dagegen, aber auch selten dafür
Was helfen uns Worte und Reden, man muss das Leben schon spüren
Wir wollen mehr als euch lieb ist und geben mehr als wir können
Wir sind erst wirklich zufrieden, wenn wir durchbrechen

Wenn wir ausbrechen, wir drängen hinaus
Wir laufen hinab und rennen hinauf
Auf dem vom Tag warmen Dach über der schlafenden Stadt
Sind wir gelegen und träumten, was ist davon geblieben?

Wir wollten das Leben erleben, alle Monster und Riesen
Im Armdrücken besiegen bis die Sonne uns auffrisst
Und am Ende ein Meer
Diese Straße ist alles, diese Straße ist mehr

Mehr als schwarz-weiß, mehr als nur Teer
Mehr als schwarz-weiß, mehr als nur Teer

Tage, Jahre, fahren vorbei
Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre
(Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre
Tage, Jahre)

Diese Straße, sie führt dich irgendwo hin
Vielleicht führt sie dich aber auch nirgendwo hin
Aber nirgendwo muss ja auch irgendwo sein
Und irgendwann findet jeder mal Heim, jeder mal Heim

Diese Straße, sie führt dich irgendwo hin
Vielleicht führt sie dich aber auch nirgendwo hin
Aber nirgendwo muss ja auch irgendwo sein
Und irgendwann findet jeder mal Heim, jeder mal Heim

Soweit so labil
Das Ziel es ist fern
Doch das ist egal
Denn wir frieren sehr gerne
Es ist alles egal
Solange wir sind
Und halb so fatal
Wie wir das empfinden
Ich dreh mich im Kreis
Und du tust das auch
Wir sind kreidebleich
Und plustern uns auf
Bis die Sonne erscheint
Deine Küsse sind klebrig
Wir sind ein Teil
Wir sind ein wenig eklig
Es ist alles so schwarz
Aber alles so klar
Wir sind uns so fern
Wir sind uns so nah
Dieser Raum ist ein Traum
Und kaum zu durchschauen
Zappeln
Tanzen
Nie wieder schlafen

Wir waren das Schaf
Wir waren der Wolf
Wir waren der Yucon
Wir waren das Gold
Wir sind endlich unendlich
Endlich unendlich
Wir waren gefangen
Wir waren auf der Flucht
Wir waren die Angst
Und wir waren die Sucht
Wir sind endlich unendlich
Endlich unendlich

Augen auf - Augen zu
Wir sind eins
Atemzug - Atem zu
Wir sind zwei
Weggerannt
Angekommen
Es erkannt
Land gewonnen
Für 72 Stunden
Dem Wahnsinn entkommen
Es ist kalt und banal
Aber halt ein Kanal
Für uns
Um uns
Und auch albern und wahr
Schweiss läuft
Eis häuft sich an und verrinnt
Während wir reden und reden
Nicht mehr sind wer wir sind
Immer wieder und wieder
Zucker
Lieber alles auf einmal als einmal und nie wieder
Stunden verfliegen
Tage vergehen
Worte erliegen
Doch Fragen bestehen

Wir waren das Schaf
Wir waren der Wolf
Wir waren der Yucon
Wir waren das Gold
Wir sind endlich unendlich
Endlich unendlich
Wir waren gefangen
Wir waren auf der Flucht
Wir waren die Angst
Und wir waren die Sucht
Wir sind endlich unendlich
Endlich unendlich

Sind nun die Stunden verflogen
Oder die Tage vergangen
Es hat sich sehr behutsam erhoben
Doch blieb es in sich gefangen
Wir sahen sie kommen
Und sahen sie gehen
Sahen ihn kommen
Und sahen ihn gehen
In dem Raum zwischen unseren Fingern
Blieben sie auch kurz etwas stehen
Es sind zwei Kreise
Zwei Ringe
Sie drehen sich um uns im Kreis
Und ringen mit ihrem und unserem Stillstand
Der uns sonst fortwährend ereilt
Es springt umher wie ein Flackern
Es ist wild und es breitet sich aus
Man kann es weder halten noch fassen
Es bricht einfach aus uns heraus

Dort wo sich Nebel und Rauch
Und Staub
In unseren Lungen vermischen
Sind sich jaja und oui oui
So nah wie noch nie
Wir sind so da wie noch nie
Dort liegen wir uns in den Armen
Dort stehen wir uns auf den Füßen
Dort ist das alles unendlich
Dieses All ist unendlich
Dann ist das alles und endlich komplett und ganz
Denn das war es noch nie
Wir sind so da wie noch nie
Wir sind so klar wie noch nie
Wir sind so da wie noch nie
Komplett und ganz

Sind unsere Träume intakt
Oder am Ende geplatzt
Es wirkt alles so neu
So anders
So friedlich
Bald ist es Nacht
Wann fing das an
Was ist passiert
Was hat uns bloß
So ruiniert
Wo führt das hin
Wenn es passiert
Wo ist der Sinn
Und wo sind wir
Ist doch für uns das Chaos die Ordnung
Wir haben uns dort immer wieder wiedergefunden
Es ist nicht alles in Ordnung
Doch auch noch längst nicht alles verschwunden
Nun stehen wir hier
Und sind schon wieder verwirrt
Meine Worte sind ein Wasserfall
Keiner kann sie kapieren
Deine Augen sind ein Labyrinth
Ich hab mich verirrt
Jetzt können wir alles gewinnen
Und alles verlieren

Dort wo sich Nebel und Rauch
Und Staub
In unseren Lungen vermischen
Sind sich jaja und oui oui
So nah wie noch nie
Wir sind so da wie noch nie
Dort liegen wir uns in den Armen
Dort stehen wir uns auf den Füßen
Dort ist das alles unendlich
Dieses All ist unendlich
Dann ist das alles und endlich komplett und ganz
Denn das war es noch nie
Wir sind so da wie noch nie
Wir sind so klar wie noch nie
Wir sind so da wie noch nie

Ich hol dich ab
Wir brechen aus
Aus dieser Stadt aus Styropor
An diesem kalten alten See
Mit den Bäumen aus Granit davor
Ich zieh dich aus den grauen Tagen
Und schubs dich in dein Leben rein
Kann dich nicht heben oder tragen
Wenn du es nicht von selbst begreifst
Ich hol dich raus aus diesem Brunnen
In den du fielst aus dem du riefst
Sie hatten doch kein Wort vernommen
Aber taten so als täten sie es
Du hast gekämpft
Gegen den Sinn
Hast dich gewehrt bis alles fiel
Hast dich dabei nie aufgegeben
Bist immer weiter
Immer weiter

Und jetzt wirkt das alles nicht mehr (Weißt du noch wie es war)
Jetzt ist das alles nichts mehr wert (Wir waren in Gefahr)
Und jetzt ist das alles nicht mehr (Was am Ende bleibt)
Jetzt sind wir alle alle (Das zeigt uns die Zeit)

Ich halte ein
Höre deine Worte
Auch wenn sie mich sehr traurig stimmen
Es sind und bleiben deine Worte
Transportiert durch tausend Stimmen
Kann nur versuchen zu verstehen
Kann nur versuchen da zu sein
So oft es geht und immer wieder
Wenn es sein muss
Wird es so sein
Ich treib dich tapfer vor mir her
Mit Gesängen und lauten Schreien
Über die Berge bis ans Meer
Dein Name wird mein Schlachtruf sein
Es ist als wärst du halb gekentert
Die Wellen haben längst dein Boot geentert
Wir wie Piraten in der See
Doch diese Tage sind längst passee

Und jetzt wirkt das alles nicht mehr (Weißt du noch wie es war)
Jetzt ist das alles nichts mehr wert (Wir waren in Gefahr)
Und jetzt ist das alles nicht mehr (Was am Ende bleibt)
Jetzt sind wir alle alle (Das zeigt uns die Zeit)

Denn der ist ja echt mal wirklich klasse
Und der Rest von dir ist auch rotzfrech
Jetzt stichst du endlich wieder raus aus der Masse

Ja die Cowboystiefel mit den Leggins drin
Um die biste echt mal zu beneiden
Und die Glitzerjacke in dem fetten pink

Dem weißen Handschuh und dem ganzen Blingbling

Wenn du willst kann ich dich sofort hinbring

Oh yeah... dein Lippenstift und dann der Wangenrouge
Die bunten Nägel und noch tausend Sachen
Ich würd dich gerne sehn in unseren Videos
Aber erst müssen wir aus der Nacht was machen

Wir woll'n die Freiheit der Welt und Straßen aus Zucker
Schneien soll's Geld und ab und zu Futter
Für Kanonen aus Plastik auf Panzern aus Watte
In 1000 Jahren sind wir Klassik, selbst wenn wir's maßlos verkacken

Zieh'n wir unser Ding durch, nur Spaß muss es machen
Ihr habt recht ja wir sind durch und partiell auch Spacken
Doch uns anpassen das klappt nicht, wir werden's auch nicht versuchen
Man kann uns nicht verkaufen, nur laufend verfluchen

Du willst'n Stück von dem Kuchen, dann fick dich wir suchen
Ein Label mit Knebelvertrag das uns komplett in Verruf bringt

Der Zucker den wir brauchen
Der ist in unseren Köpfen schon drin
Weil der Aufwind auf dem wir pausenlos drauf sind
Der macht uns körperlich hin


Unser Zeug das schmeckt nach Scheisse
Und ist auch ziemlich fettig
Doch ihr fangt an zu schrein
Weil dieser Track ein Brett ist
Was uns dann auch nicht wundert
Ihr werdet langsam munter
Wir gehen bestimmt nicht unter
Denn ihr kommt nicht mehr runter

(Ihr kommt nicht mehr runter)
(Denn ihr kommt nicht mehr runter)
(Ihr kommt nicht mehr runter)

Der Zucker den wir brauchen
Der ist in unseren Köpfen schon drin
Weil der Aufwind auf dem wir pausenlos drauf sind
Der macht uns körperlich hin


Oft sitzen wir zuhause
Und ziehn uns unser Crack rein
Nonstop und ohne Pause
Genau wie Günther Beckstein
Wohin führt uns die Nacht
Wir wollen sie zerfeiern
Doch will man uns nicht lassen
So ist das halt in Bayern

Der Zucker den wir brauchen
Der ist in unseren Köpfen schon drin
Weil der Aufwind auf dem wir pausenlos drauf sind
Der macht uns körperlich hin


Dieser Sound fickt euer Hirn
So das ihr alle aufbleibt
Bis übermorgen Abend
Und nicht merkt das ihr drauf seit
Auf unsern kranken Wellen
Die euch komplett ergreifen
Ihr könnt es nicht abstellen
Geschweige denn vermeiden

(Es lässt sich nicht vermeiden)
(Du kannst es nicht vermeiden)

Du wärst gerne einfach anders
Leider sind wir alle gleich
Tagelang die Nacht durchwandert
Am Ende hat's nicht gereicht
Ohne Flügel lebt's sich besser
Hieß es, doch war's leider falsch
Mit der Lüge lernt man leben
Ohne Bäume gäb's kein' Wald
Schau zurück
Doch wir sind längst schon über den Zenit hinaus
Haben uns an ihm festgebissen
Ihn zerrissen
Fertig aus
Willst du meistens das, was er hat,
Aber höchstens mit dir teilt
Du gehst wieder einmal leer aus
Sie der Bogen, du der Pfeil

Hoffentlich scheint morgen Sonne
Denn mit Regen kommt nur das,
Was du nicht willst, in dein Leben
Tropfen ronnen
Nichts gewonnen

Bücher brannten
Menschen starben
Die Geschichte ist ein Loop
Sieh nur, alles wiederholt sich
Wirklich wahr
Das ist nicht gut
Inne halten
Einmal atmen
Luft hinein und Luft hinaus
Drinnen Kälte
Draußen warten
Das Feuer war plötzlich aus.
Du und Deutschland teilen eins:
Ihr werdet euch wohl nie verstehen
Irgendwann wirst du verschwinden
Und es nie mehr wieder sehen

Auf Wiedersehen - Wir werden uns nie wieder sehen
Du wirst zu mir kommen - Doch ich werde wieder gehen

Make love in a train cross country

No, not like that
I don't want to be your mother

I want you to justify my love, my love, my love

I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it's complicated
And though I know you can't appreciate it
I'm only happy when it rains

You know I love it when the news is bad
And why it feels so good to feel so sad
I'm only happy when it rains

Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me
Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me

I'm only happy when it rains
I feel good when things are going wrong
I only listen to the sad, sad songs
I'm only happy when it rains

I only smile in the dark
My only comfort is the night gone black
I didn't accidentally tell you that
I'm only happy when it rains

You'll get the message by the time I'm through
When I complain about me and you
I'm only happy when it rains

Pour your misery down (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down on me (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down on me (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down on me (pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down

You can keep me company
As long as you don't care

I'm only happy when it rains
You wanna hear about my new obsession?
I'm riding high upon a deep depression

I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains (pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains!

If you say you'll help me out

Don't worry baby
No need to fight

This is the noise that keeps me awake
My head explodes and my body aches

P-p-p-p-push it, make the beats go harder

I'm sorry that I hurt you
Please don't ask me why
I want to see you happy

I got you crawling up a mountain
Hanging round my neck
I got you twisted round my finger
Crawling round my legs

The emptiness, the craziness
Satisfy this hungriness
Darling, how would it feel?

If we sleep together, will you like me better?
If we come together, we'll go down forever
If we sleep together, will I like you better?
If we come together, prove it now or never

Make me a pretty person
Make me feel like I belong
Make me hard and make me happy
Make me beautiful

The emptiness, the craziness
Satisfy this hungriness
Darling, how would it feel?

If we sleep together, will you like me better?
If we come together, we'll go down forever
If we sleep together, will I like you better?

Nothing satisfies me, baby!

If we sleep together
I'll wear something pretty, baby!

If we sleep together
Give me what I crave now, baby!

You look so fine
I want to break your heart
And give you mine
You're taking me over

It's so insane
You've got me tethered and chained
I hear your name
And I'm falling over

I'm not like all the other girls
I can't take it like the other girls
I won't share it like the other girls
That you used to know

You look so fine

Knocked down
Cried out
Been down just to find out
I'm through bleeding for you

I'm open wide
I want to take you home
We'll waste some time
You're the only one for me

You look so fine
I'm like the desert tonight
Leave her behind
If you want to show me

I'm not like all the other girls
I won't take it like the other girls
I won't fake it like the other girls
That you used to know

You're taking me over
Over and over
I'm falling over
Over and over

You're taking me over
(drown in me one more time)
Over and over
(hide inside me tonight)
I'm falling over
(do what you want to do)
Over and over
(let's pretend happy end)

You're taking me over

And I close my eyes
I see more than I see
Then I see my life
And I feel more than I feel

I feel the center of me,
That peace inside
I remember the time
When life  was more like a fight

Is this the place
We will stay forever (and ever, and ever)
Or is it a dream I was waiting forever (and ever, and ever)
It feels so good and I never wish to wake up (never wish to wake up)
And it feels so real, I never want it to stop (to stop, to stop, to stop)

Never want it to stop

I opened my eyes when
I smelled my breath
And I saw the sky
But my feels dead

My body feels warm and save
I tried to scream
But my body hurt me
And I knew it was a dream

Is this the place
We will stay forever (and ever, and ever)
Or is it a dream I was waiting forever (and ever, and ever)
It feels so good and I never wish to wake up (never wish to wake up)
And it feels so real, I never want it to stop (to stop, to stop, to stop)

You were my hero, adore an altar I adorn with flowers
You were my god, my guilded picture of my fantasy
You were my hero but then I saw that you are just a human
You were my hero but now your altar bursting into flames

Forget your idols, believe in yourself, use your power to be free
Then my pictures decaying to dust, burning in the fire

You were my god, I am able to see that every fault is also yours
All the pictures blow with the wind, when I see clear
You were my god, my guilded picture of my fantasy
You were my hero but then I saw that you were just a human

Forget your idols, believe in yourself, use your power to be free
Then my pictures decaying to dust, burning in the fire

The end of this control
Until your soul is free

When you are alone by yourself
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

And the light of the dawn,
And the shadow in your face,
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

And the light of the dawn,
And the shadow in your face,
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

Yeah it's got the feeling, and it's got the future, you hold your hands out
With nothing to give

Your mind and your body
Slave to a memory
And a quiet smile
'Til the moment is past

When you are alone by yourself,
Reach for the stars and you can touch them

You give all that you have,
To give a meaning,
You have nothing to hide,
To hide at all

Your mind and your body
Slave to a memory
And a quiet smile
'Til the moment is past

When you are alone by yourself,
Reach for the stars and you can touch them

And the light of the dawn,
And the shadow in your face,
Reach for the stars and you will touch them

We stay together, together in my dream,
When we were closer love was to be seen
Yeah I can feel you, hear your distant voice,
From another world love was our choice

When I think about you, when I close my eyes,
I can see your smile, I feel you nearby
When I think about you...
Then I recognize how much I love you
I love you

Miles from nowhere, nowhere where you are,
This lonely highway my thoughts escape so far
Another world another life is in my head,
Through all that distance it's true what I said

When I think about you, when I close my eyes,
I can see your smile, I feel you nearby
When I think about you, when I close my eyes,

Welcher Gott tat mir das an, bin ich tot, dass ich's ertragen kann?
Du stehst vor mir in weißem Licht, wer bist du, ich kenn' dich nicht?
Nimm mich auf und trage mich fort, an einen anderen Ort

Feuerengel führ' mich ins weiße Licht zu dir
Feuerengel lass' mich nicht brennen komm zu mir
Feuerengel ich liege hier und wart' auf dich
Feuerengel deine Flügel tragen mich

I feel your warm skin
And I smell your breath
Before the dawn is coming up
I love you to death

In deep dark colors

I watch the stars
You turn out the light
I keep your warm hand and
We enjoy our night

I wish the time we spend
Will last forever
And the time that's left
We will be together

Gently my soul is touching your dreams
Softly my tear drops on to your body
The tragic of existence makes my dream breathe
Although my body now wants to leave

Love is in my world
It lets me cry a tear
It makes me feel so real - within you

Love is in my world
It makes my dream come true
I feel it in my heart - within you

(Within you)

Endless dreams are wrapping all over my spirit
Pushing me into endless loneliness
Of our reality and the bottom pit
Of all the ongoing worldliness

Love is in my world
It lets me cry a tear
It makes me feel so real - within you

Love is in my world
It makes my dream come true
I feel it in my heart - within you

Als wärst Du ständig um mich rum
Meine Gedanken sind bei Dir

Die Vergangenheit holt uns ein
Als würden wir niemals frei sein
Wie eine Reise ohne Ziel
Was ich verlange ist zuviel

Was bleibt ist chaos in meinem herz
In meinem kopf ein dumpfer schmerz
Und ein gefühl so endlos leer
So übermachtig endlos schwer

Was bleibt ist atmen ohne luft
Ist dein geruch ohne deinen duft
So wie ein raum ohne licht
Ohne dich schaff ich es nicht

Of peace and harmony
Relax and touch my skin
But close your eyes

Come here, don't walk away
Find yourself and stay
Trust me all night and day
You've got the key

You can reach my heart
And we fly away, touch me
I will break apart, you and me
We will be free, touch me

Come look into my soul
There is no chance to hide
The beauty of the end
Can you understand?

Don't try to hide your greed
And you will find much more
No life behind the wall
After the war

You can reach my heart
And we fly away, touch me
I will break apart, you and me
We will be free, touch me

I wish I was free now
You drive me into a place
Where I barely can hide from you
Moments at a time

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you?
I'm always turning around
To see you starring on my back

Sometimes I find that my
Delivery is all the same
And when I look at you
I instinctively start the game

I never see what you mean when you
Start to weep and scream at me
Oh no, the ringing in my head again!
Oh no, you're ripping off my face again!

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you?
I'm always turning around
To see you starring on my back

Why?

You're just a pretty face
You're just a pretty face

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you?
I'm always turning around
To see you starring on my back

Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all

Died in the church and was buried along with her name

Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks trom the grave
No one was saved

Slowly he settles down
To give them what they want
He tries to keep himself together

I would slam my head in the ground
Before I tell you this
He turns his head to the floor
As it falls away

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today

You tought me everything you know
The blame will surely show, yea
I tried to keep it down
Forever

The days have taken years
To conquer all my fears
I stand before you now
Sickened and cut down

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?

Standing in the back of the line
I feel the others try to push me
Down and keep it away from me
Grabbing at the one thing that I know is mine

Can't you see me with my head to the floor
Feel the recklessness of absolute desperation
Valued sentimental pieces of the life
I thought I held in my hands

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize
That I've always been sinking?

Failing everyday
It only helps to aggravate
The sickening feeling
Inside that won't go away

Fall down
Pick yourself up and fall down
Drink from my cup and fall down
This is what it's like to be me, me
Can't you see what I see?

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize
That I've always been sinking?

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize
That I've always been sinking?

What I am is what I feel
But what I feel is nothing real
And what I know is all I want
Is to be saved from this spot
Is to be saved from this spot
Is to be saved from this spot

Why do I always try
To better what I am?
Can't I realize

But I can't, I am numb
I want to see what's become
Close my eyes, bite my tongue

If you believe in me
I'll try not to die
If work keeps me living
It's got to start giving me life
Not just strife

I'm so tired of living here
I'm so tired of giving here

I'm so tired of living here

I want to run and be free
But I can't, I'm so weak, yea
I want to hold you again
In my arms, my old friend

I have just one more chance to feel
What is real
I can't keep on going
I feel my mind slowing
My heart's torn apart

See me dead before you, take my hand
I can make you understand
I have tried to help them, tried to speak
Wasted effort makes me weak

And I want a breakdown
So I can be unbound
I want to be anybody else right now

They'll use this against me, try to take
All the progress that I'd make
Don't you turn against me, try to run
Undo damage you have done

And I want a breakdown

They don't try to break me
They just cut and rape me

The door is closed and you're confined
To everyhing you've done
A thousand times

You're getting weaker every day
The room is filled with your dismay
It's getting harder to convey
Just what you're living with

Trapped alone
Burned out from the inside
Overthrown
By the lies of your self-pride

You kick your feet to run away
But all your effort goes astray
You feel as though you're made
Of clay and dirt

Now every bone is cracking in
You feel it underneath your skin
You wish you knew the origin
Of what I'm living with

Trapped alone
Burned out from the inside
Overthrown
By the lies of your self-pride

Terror is here, beyond your fear
A ghost of your memory
Desperate dreams can't intervene

Rip my last hope right out of me

Take the place of another

I could turn myself into a miracle man
Bow before the things you hold sacred
Sparkling example of the one that you want
Leaving your existence mine to haunt

Don't you think this is unreal
You could be anyone
Take the place of another
End it all with a gun

I pray that everyday will be my last
Just give me away)

And it feels the same with anyone
And I know this has been overdone
Now it feels the same with everyone

Another life I'll never reach
Anything I want to

To bend the time
I pine away behind the mask
Of mandatory joy

Can't keep from running away
Do you see?
This is my destiny

I want to be like you
I want to live off the things that you always do
I want to be renewed
I want to know what it's like to be just like you

I wait in line
I walk the shallow empty halls
A terror in my mind waiting for you

I start to realize
That you're standing where
I should have been

Can't keep from falling apart
Do you see?
It's my catastrophe

I want to be like you
I want to live off the things that you always do

Feeling thing she's never known before
It tastes like rotten candy apples
It burns like all the lies she's never heard before

And all her dreams are shattered
On the floor again
And all her tries have failed
And lie among the dust

And all the time they spent apart
She hoped would make him see
That she was just the one for him
But he never looked inside himself

To find the empty heart of cold
That wraps around his soul of black
And buries him
In his grave of pain

And all her dreams are shattered
On the floor again
And all her tries have failed
And lie among the dust

He'll never understand
Why she cannot see the end
Of the world she made for them
And everything she grew to love

She'll never see inside
That he told her only lies
And convictions that he had
Just fell into an empty void

And all that really mattered
To make her whole again
Was broken outside
And never came in from the cold

With all of my ferocity

I feel the hate in me awakening
(can't stop remembering)
I've hurt my face to stop my suffering
(can't stop remembering)

I feel the hatred
From every word you said
Consume me until I'm driven
To my death bed

Now you're inside of me
You'll never let me breath
I see the terror
Of all your inhumanity

I feel the hate in me awakening
(can't stop remembering)
I've hurt my face to stop my suffering
(can't stop remembering)

I can't believe the fear and doubt you bring
(can't stop remembering)
You made me what I am it's sickening

Under here
There's no light
Take from me my sight
I don't need it anymore

You came here
With your fire
Burned out my desire
Took the whisper from the flame

I never wanted
I never knew
It was you

I stood there helpless
Far and away
Nothing left to say

And it feels the same that it did before
Only without you

And I cry the same that I did before
Only without you

I failed to see the light that was for me
I choked my resurrection

Now that everything's been said
I don't even stand a chance
Now I'm sinking

Thought those words would set me free
But the chains remained attached
To the places I recall
Had always been there

You can't even say my name
I'll try not to cry for long

Everything comes back to haunt me
For I've become my worst enemy

As I search to find the truth
I won't have to look for long
For the answer stares at me
Broken mirror

I can't even look at my face
As the knife begins to cut

Everything comes back to haunt me
So I've become my worst enemy

Everything comes back to haunt me
So I've become my worst enemy

Everything comes back to haunt me

Creeping up again
Lost myself and it's too late
Killing time again
Waiting for my only fate

Trapped within the cage
That I've built with my own hands
Can't release the rage
Shattered life and broken plans

If I knew myself
I wouldn't keep on doing this
But I trick myself
And believe with just one kiss

I can't believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

In the dark again
Afraid to move but can't sit still
Killed my heart again
To myself I give this pill

If I was myself
I'd find strength to push away
But I hurt myself
And I weaken more each day

I can't believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

As I come to know you
My disgust grows anew
As you tighten your grip
My worn throat slowly slits

I can't believe the things I do
All for the sake of pleasing you

I should just stop and let you know
But I'm afraid of letting go

Letting go

You just threw on me

And I don't believe that I could ever be with you
And I don't believe that we could ever be together

Calling out to you, try to show the truth
But you just carry on
Killing everything that we once had
And never really understanding why

And I don't believe that I could ever be with you
And I don't believe that we could ever be together

You've taken everything and left me here with nothing
Taken everything and left me here with nothing
You've taken everything and left me here with nothing

Holding time for me
Tells me about herself

Up and down for me
Keeps it inside herself

As the deception reveals itself

My morality
A slave to gravity
My sanity has turned to agony

Are never happy?

You live your life in fantasy
And glass cathedrals
Why don't you come down from your cloud
And face reality?

I want, I love, I need, I breathe,
I lust, I trust, I cheat, I bleed

Behind the walls they built for you
You live your orchestrated life
Inside your heart you know it's wrong
But you can't stop it
Your soul it longs for something more
But never finds it
And so you blame me for it all
And choose another

If your instinct's always right
How about I step aside?
And let you do your thing again

If there's nothing that can fool you
How come you're all alone?
Anything can happen now

When you close your little eyes
They will plunder all your dreams
And take away your teddy bear

I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time

Monkey see and monkey do
Now what a fool are you
To do just what they told you to?

And now you know how roles can change
You used to be so out of range
For anything that brought you down

Every time you go to sleep
You get to feel how this runs so deep
Makes nightmares out of pretty dreams

I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time

I just wish there was something
That you could say
That could make me care again

Something that would make me want to get you out of this
But there is really nothing left
Of anything we've had

So now you're on your own
So now you're all alone
Just like you always wanted it to be

No one to tell you how to think
No one to tell you when to stop
No one to tell you when to think about the fact that you fucked up

That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up

That you fucked up again

As I sit here
And slowly close my eyes
I take another deep breath
And feel the wind pass through my body

I'm the one in your soul
Reflecting inner light
Protect the ones who hold you
Cradling your inner child

I-I need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go by

Where do we go when we just don't know,
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold?
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing,
And when will we learn to control?

Tragic visions
Slowly stole my life
Tore away everything
Cheating me out of my time

I'm the one who loves you
No matter wrong or right
And every day I hold you
I hold you with my inner child

I-I need serenity
In a place where I can hide

Where do we go when we just don't know,

And my decisions brought me to my knees
I needed someone to blame

Time to do what's best for me
I believe I can change

Once upon a time in broken dreams
Reflection's that I can't face
So hold your breath and make a wish for me
Take me to a better place

Time always seems to be passing by
It never waits for me
If I could do it all one more time
I wouldn't change a thing

Oh man, I'm tired and lonely

Again, why must it be
A man is drowning slowly
And he can't keep above
Gone way too deep, oh yeah

Open skies are falling,
Tears are coming down.
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around

One rainy day

Oh, so many times I should've crawled when I went running by
And since then I've been left feeling traumatized, yea

Raped and drained of an innocence
A gift we've lost over time
And still I gaze through this one rainy day
Alone with no one by my side

Open skies are falling,
Tears are coming down.
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around, yeah

I swear I've given,
I've given you all I can
Never will you ever make me feel this way again, oh
On this one rainy day

Hey, open skies are falling,
Tears are coming down.
Like a drop of rain falls to the ocean
And comes back around

One rainy day

Oh one rainy day

Ich schau in den Spiegel
Der Spiegel zerbricht
Die sanfte Form verändert sich
Zum Chaos ohne Sinn
Im Kristallstaub der zu Boden sinkt
Bricht sich das Licht millionenfach

Aufgespalten in seine Farben
Wird das Unsichtbare zu Rot und Blau zersetzt
Der geborstene Spiegel hängt noch an der Wand
Mein Gesicht ist verschwunden
Mein Geist zersplittert und zerstört
In zahllose Scherben zersprungen

Die Gedanken zerschnitten
Doch es blutet nicht ...

Nur der Geist ist verloren

Ich habe aufgehört zu existieren.

Der Wind beißt eisig im Gesicht.
Der Atem sticht spitz die Lunge
bei jedem Atemzug aufs neue.
In den Gedanken lebt die Vergangenheit,
die Kindheit, die Jugend, die Freundin, der erste Kuss,
aber auch Liebeskummer, Eifersucht, Krankheit und Hass

Das Gute beginnt im Geist zu trüben -
das Schlechte überwiegt.
Die Waagschale senkt sich auf die dunkle Seite
nur gebremst vom Tod?
Die Einsamkeit in der ich stehe
ist nicht nur draußen,
sie steckt tief in mir
eingebrannt -
Meine Gefühle gefrieren wie jetzt mein Körper...;

Die Zivilisation ist weit entfernt
kein Licht, keine Stimmen,
nur die Ruhe.
Der Schnee ist kalt -
bald spür ich nichts.
Ich leg mich hin,
schließ die Augen und denk an die Vergangenheit zurück ...

- Leuchtende Kinderaugen unterm Weihnachtsbaum
- Tränen der Freude oder Trauer?

Der Mond versteckt sich hinter Wolken
aus denen Flocken wild im Reigen tanzen
zur Melodie des Windes
der mein Gesicht mit Nadelstichen umschmeichelt
die ich nicht spür!
die ich nicht spür! ...;

Wie still es ist,
als ob jemand wartet.
Auf mich? Wer schon?
der Wind bläst Eiskristalle auf meinen Körper
färbt ihn weiß - ganz unsichtbar,
wie meine Gedanken
es fällt mir schwer zu denken
ich bin todmüde,
als hätte ich Jahre nicht geschlafen
ich schließe die Augen und schlafe ein
... beginne zu träumen ...

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand leugnet
Meine Kopfstimme
Liegt über meinem Wissen
Wiegt es sanft auf den Wogen
1000 toter Traumsequenzen

Das lenkt ab
Manipuliert - filtert - polarisiert
Sprich: fälscht!
Lügen erleichtern den Augenblick
Aber verschlammen die Zukunft

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand leugnet - noch
Meine Kopfstimme redet wirr
Ich versuche sie zu ignorieren
Ich weiß dass ich existiere
Oder glaube ich zu leben?

Denken ist manchmal so,
Als würde man Wissen auskotzen.
Erfahrung macht manchmal blinder
Als zwei ausgestochene Augen

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand stimmt zu
Meine Kopfstimme wirkt
Irgendwie erklärend
Wie lange noch?
Ich habe wirklich keine Ahnung
Nur ein Ende ist abzusehen
Das Papier ist begrenzt gewesen
Der Tisch, der Stuhl,
Das Bett, die Wand
Voller Wissensflecke

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand wird leiser
Meine Kopfstimme beginnt
Mich zu überzeugen

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand wirkt unecht
Meine Kopfstimme verteidigt
Meinen Verstand
Für seine Lügen

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand schweigt
Meine Kopfstimme schlägt
Meine Haut vor

Nicht schneiden, schreiben
Dem Schmerz die Worte schenken

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand schweigt
Meine Kopfstimme diktiert
Und die Schatten nehmen Gestalt an
Das Schattendenken
Küsst meine Haut
Kehrt zurück
Kehrt zurück
Kehrt zurück
Kehrt zurück

Mein Fleisch bittet darum
Mein Verstand schweigt
Meine Kopfstimme wird lauter

So suche ich und find
Nur Stück für Stück
Das Fleisch die Lust
Die Furcht die Frucht
Und immer wieder Mauern
Sie trennen mich von meiner
Phantasiebefleckten Welt
Doch über Mauern
Kann man springen
Es geht ganz leicht,
Man braucht nur Mut

Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu

Wenn ich zum Himmel blicke
Sehe ich keine Engel
Aber Wolkentürme
Die Geschichten formen
Besser als nur Regen sehen
Der Wind trägt
Bunte Drachenflieger
Und zerstört als Sturm nur selten
Sehe was du dir erträumst
Von bunten Kinderliedern
Der Ewigtraum betrügt Dich nie
Doch wird er Dich
Irgendwann vergessen?
Nur wenn man es zulässt

Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu

Im Reich der Mythen
Und Geschichten
Verlor ich meine Angst

Denn nur lebend lohnt,
Lohnt es sich zu

Doch vorher will ich atmen
Und so viel Träumen leben
Und erzählen, tanzen, spielen
Mir scheint es ist noch Zeit,
Bis mich das Leben überholt
Denn noch brennt die Sehnsucht
Die Gier nach allem Wissen
Die Lust auf noch so vieles mehr
Auch wenn ich sprachlos bin
So weiß ich tausend Worte
Die schöner sind auch Hässliches
Erträglich werden lassen
Denn wer lebt kann
Auch in Ruhe sterben

Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu

Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu

Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu

Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu
Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu

Denn nur lebend lohnt es,
Lohnt es sich zu sterben.

Wenn man sein Gesicht
In den Schnee presst,
Vergisst man irgendwann die Kälte.
Doch der Verstand
Sagt irgendwann: aufstehen!
Man steht auf, läuft weiter,
Sucht weiter und denkt weiter nach.

Zurück bleibt ein Abdruck des Gesichtes,
Eine Negativmaske im Schnee.

Diese verschwindet,
Wenn die Natur an ihr nagt.
Das Weiß bedeckt
Oder modelliert die Maske
Bis sie unkenntlich wird,
Verschwindet.

Der Raum ist weiß.
Die Negativmaske
Existiert dann nur noch als Gedanke.
Der Schnee ist nur ein Kissen
Das reicht nicht aus um zu ersticken.

Ich kannte einen Menschen,
Der suchte Wärme anstatt Kälte.
Er hielt seinen Kopf solange
Unter das heiße Wasser
Des Wasserhahnes
Bis er an den Verbrühungen starb.
Es dauerte fast eine Stunde
Jene die ihn fanden,
Mussten sich übergeben,
Sein Gesicht war fast gargekocht.
Jetzt ist das Wasser
Nur noch lauwarm.

Ich bevorzuge die Kälte
Obwohl es bekanntlich
Irgendwann egal ist
Ob zu kalt oder zu heiß,
Es tut einfach nur weh.
Ich sitze hier, um mich
Vor mir selbst zu schützen.
Es ist immer ein bisschen kühl
In diesem weißen Raum.

Aber es macht mir nichts aus.
Was niemand weiß:
Ich kann diesen Ort verlassen,
Ja, wirklich
Und dann entdecke ich
Allerlei Absonderliches
All das schreibe ich auf, wenn ich
Wieder hierher zurückkehre.
Ich war dort und habe alles gesehen.
Ich weiß, dass die Welt weiß
Geworden ist, nicht nur hier,
Auch draußen,
Vor der Tür, hinter diesen Wänden.

Als ich den Tag als das erkannte
Was er wirklich war
Waren die Schatten deutlich hörbar

Warum blühen und verwelken
Weinend Wasser trinken
Und im Strudel sanft versinken
Umarmt vom Nass
Ein nicht ganz konsequenter
Schwimmversuch

Das Lied der Freiheit
Stumm in Ketten
Rostbraun
Gleichwohl
Am Jetzt gebunden
Schlicht gefangen

Meine Welt ist Grau
Schwarz Weiß
Ein Mischton aus Gut und Böse

Doch die kleinen Zwischenbilder
Heucheln buntes Zeitvergnügen
Nicht sehend
Doch ins Hirn geschossen
Flüstern sie
Verstandentschlossen
Auch ohne Ohren
Ganz lieblich kühl
Das Blitzgewitter
Macht die Augen
Selbst für schöne
Dinge blind

Die Schatten denken mit

Gefühle werden konsumiert
Vakuumverpackt
Bezahlt?
Mal warm mal tiefgekühlt
Verschenkt?
Mal aufgedrängt
Da zum Selbstzweck
Scheinbar unbrauchbar
Ein Mehr als totes Beigeschenk
Niemals gelebt
Die Seele
Schlicht verhundern lässt

Und nur der Zorn
Treibt mir jenes Wasser
In die Augen
Welches irgendwann
Als Meer
Mir meinen Atem
Rauben wird

Bin ich übrig?

Als ich den Tag
Als das erkannte
Was er wirklich war
Beschloss ich
Wach zu sterben

Wann beginnt man eigentlich sich,
Für seine eigene Vergangenheit zu interessieren?
Dann, wenn man etwas erreicht hat,
Oder in dem Moment in dem man glaubt
Sich im Ideensturz befindlich
Scheitern zu sehen?

Eine Freifallübung der Seele,
Unbeschadet überstehen,
Nur leicht geprellt,
Doch bleibend schmerzhaft.
Was ist es wohl für ein Gefühl,
Zufrieden zu sein?
Im kleinen unscheinbaren Glück gefangen,
Einen Moment lang oder ohne Maß?

Welche Gedankenlücke
Steckt hinter der Ambition der Zukunft,
Die eigenen Gene zu verweigern,
Nicht aber die geistigen Kinder?

Was lebt worin weiter?
Ruhelos entwickelt sich eine Suche,
Zu einer Sucht, die alles frisst,
Vieles zerstört und jede Form
Von Unschuld raubt.

Man verliert die Unschuld nicht mit der Geburt,
Sondern indem man lebt.
Hat Intelligenz etwas mit Glück zutun?

Monatelang arbeiten, dann bermerken,
Dass vieles unverstanden bleibt.
Dem Ursprungsgedanken fehlt es an Worten.
Man wird zur Gedankenhure,
Gibt die Seele preiß,
Prostituiert sich ohne Not.
Ein Bedürfnis? Mitteilsamkeit?
Nicht an einer Idee ersticken müssen?

Vom Urgedanken zur komplexen Geschichte,
Entwickelt sich der Weg zum Ziel.
Gemeinsam spielen.
Minuten aus der Zeit auslösen.
Freisezierte Freiheit.

Der letzte Vorhang schließt den Blick nach draußen.
Existiert ein tieferer Sinn?
Berechtigt er zum neuen Fragenspieln?
Existiert ein tieferer Sinn?

Wie ein von seinem Kind enttäuschter Vater,
Leben investiert, Hoffnung korrumpiert.
Nur noch wenig stimmt noch fröhlich.
Vom Leben nichts erwarten,
Eigene Träume scheitern sehen,
Trotzdem weiterspielen.
Den Blick für das Wesentliche verlieren,
Nur dann

Im Ansatz gescheitert, aber doch noch nicht verloren.
Im Ansatz gescheitert, aber doch noch nicht verloren.
Weiterspielen.

Das Leid wütet gnadenlos
Der Hunger führt das Zepter
Nicht alle Kinder leben sorgenlos
Nur Iphigenie tanzt den ganzen Tag
Sie lacht gerne, liebt den Tag
Jeden Tag bis zu jenem Tag
Einem Freitag
Wo ist Iphigenie?
Wo ist Iphigenie?
Keiner hat das Kind gesehen
Wo ist Iphigenie?
Sie spielt so gerne ganz allein
Wo ist Iphigenie?
Die Mutter ruft vergebens
Wo ist Iphigenie?
Umsonst sucht auch der Bruder

Wo ist Iphigenie?
Wo ist Iphigenie?
Wo ist...

Ihr Vater schickte sie in die Metzgerei am Ort
Zu einem freundlichen kleinen dicken Mann
Und er mochte kleine Mädchen
Besonders ihr Fleisch
Es war so zart und Schlachtvieh war rar
Das Messer blitzt und tranchiert geschickt und lautlos ihren kleinen Körper
Stück für Stück
Trennt er das Fleisch von den Knochen

Es ist Sonntag Mittag
Die Familie sitzt zu Tisch
Der Braten riecht gar köstlich
Die Mutter sitzt am Tisch - Wo ist Iphigenie?
Der Vater sitzt am Tisch - Wo ist Iphigenie?
Der Bruder sitzt am Tisch - Wo ist Iphigenie?

So schwarz - So leer - Ganz still

Allein vom leeren Blick fixiert
Erwartet er den Stern im Nichts
Auf ein bekanntes Augenpaar
Das in das Zimmer blickt

Im schwarzen Fenster spiegelt sich
Ein mürber Strauß einst leuchtend roter Rosen
Sie duften nicht
Die Nacht schluckt jede Wahrheit vor der Tür
Sie liebten sich berührten sich
Und ruhten nach dem Sturm

So schwarz - So leer - Ganz still
So schwarz - So leer - Ganz still

Kein Mondlicht weist ein Ziel im Nichts
Der Raum begrenzt den Blick
Die Freiheit ist so nah wie fern
Der Schlaf ließ ihn allein zurück

Allein - nicht frei - allein

Gewalt triumphiert
Ein endloses Schweigen
Das Vielkopfbiest, das das Hirn zerfrisst

Hass ist nichts als ein schreindes Gehirn
Das von Schmerzen gelähmt
Das Denken vergisst und das Wissen erstickt

Im Himmelgrau
Tanzen schwangere Engel
Mit toten Körpern
Missbrauchter Kinder

Der Tod ist nur eine wahre Lüge
Himmelgrau, himmelgrau, himmelgrau, himmelgrau
Ich bin das Fleisch auf dem Gabentisch der Macht
Himmelgrau, himmelgrau, himmelgrau, himmelgrau

Ein Vogel fliegt vorbei
2500 Fuß
Etwas fällt
Himmelblau
In Zeitlupe
Lieblich und friedlich
Alles in Zeitlupe

2000 Fuß
Eine Stadt
Sekunden werden Minuten
Die Zeit wartet
Tick tack tick tack
Sie fällt

1500 Fuß
Zwei Menschen
Ein letzter Kuß
Zündung

Now
Nicht atmen
Ein Farbenspiel
Ein greller Blitz
Alles vergessen
Tausend Seelenfackeln
Die Hitzewelle
Tödlich glutheiß
Ein Atemzug
Ein heißer Atemzug
Giert nach

Stille
Es scheint die Erde bebt
Ganz langsam
Ganz taub
Alles geschmolzen
Die Zeit stolpert bleibt kurz stehen

Ein Haus
Ein Paar im Tod vereint
Verkohlt
Ein Schrei betäubt
Stürzt ins Dunkel
Tick tack tick tack

Now!
Shockwaved
Nichts bleibt wie es war
Geschoße aus Steine
Und Hagel aus Glas
Zerschneiden durchbohren
Häuser stürzen
Begraben was war
Begraben was war

Stille
Schwarze Wolken
Vergangenheit und Gegenwart
Zersetzen sich
Keine Worte
Keine Stimme
Und kein Wissen
Die Zukunft fehlt...;

Now!
Ein Feuersturm
Alles brennt
Selbst was nicht brennen dürfte
Es brennt
Ein Glück zu sterben
Die Fratze des Teufels
Die Macht der Menschlichkeit
Ist jetzt vorbei

Now!
Shockwaved
Nichts bleibt wie es war
Geschosse aus Steine
Und Hagel aus Glas
Zerschneiden durchbohren
Häuser stürzen
Begraben was war
Begraben was war

Stille

Hör den Tropfen
fallend rauschen,
fühl die Sonne
grüß die Haut.
Sieh die Blumen
duftend schwebend,
alles schreit
stille Zeit.

Hör den Tropfen

Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit erstickt im Farbenrausch
Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit verliert ihren halt im Raum
Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit erstickt im Farbenrausch
Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit verliert ihren halt im Raum

Nie wieder vorwärts
Schritt zurück,
der Mund verschlossen
Augenblick.
Vernähte Lippen
glaube ich,
Augen fragen
warum ich?

Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit erstickt im Farbenrausch
Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit verliert ihren halt im Raum
Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit erstickt im Farbenrausch
Paradoxe Stille - die Zeit verliert ihren halt im Raum

Entfernte Haut
nur bloßes Leben,
jeder schreit
gehört wird nichts.
Niemand wartet
keiner sieht,
warum jeder
nur nicht ich.

Das Wasser klar - befreit das Leben
umschließt jetzt kalt - als Eis den Leib

Ein Puppenkind - in blassem Rot-Ton
erstickt im Eis - wie Zuckerguß

Vermißter Traum - ich will jetzt tanzen
im kalten Bach - ganz regungslos
Vermißter Traum - will dich erträumen
ein letztes Mal - mit mir /dir allein

So süß geträumt - doch ohne Freude
niemals gesucht - und nie befreit

Es kämft allein - gegen Narben
mit blauen Lippen - der Mund einst rot

Dem Glanz beraubt - ein kalter Körper
die Zukunft friert - Pandora tanzt

Sie holt die Puppen - die Kinderkörper
ein Weinen fehlt - die Augen blind

Vermißter Traum - ich will jetzt tanzen
im kalten Bach - ganz regungslos
Vermißter Traum - will dich erträumen
ein letztes Mal - mit dir allein

Vermißter Traum - ich will jetzt tanzen
im kalten Bach - ganz regungslos
Vermißter Traum - will dich erträumen
ein letztes Mal - mit dir allein

Kaputtgeliebt  - zerstörte Seelen
mißhandelt leer - so ohne Sinn

Leergeliebt - verstörte Träume
es ist kein Mensch - der keinem fehlt.

Vermißter Traum - ich will jetzt tanzen
im kalten Bach - ganz regungslos
Vermißter Traum - will dich erträumen
ein letztes Mal - mit dir allein

Vermißter Traum - hör auf zu atmen
sieh den Ast -  den Baum , den Wald
Vermißter Traum - will dich berühren
ein letztes Mal - bin ich allein

Ganz aus Glas, kalt wie Eis
Jeder Baum im Glasgarten
Blüten rein wie Kristall
Jeder zum Glasgarten

Wie aus Wasser geformt - erstarrt.
Gesprungenes Lachen.
Elfenstimmen eilen zwischen den klaren Blüten,
eisgleicher Äste,
glashafter Bäume.

Ob sie wohl leben?
Sie werfen keine Schatten,
nur gebrochene Bilder.
Sie fächern das Licht.
Im Glasgarten verirrt sich die Zeit
und bleibt als Moment erhalten.

Nur der Mond weist den Weg zum Morgen.
Erlaubt der Sonne einen neuen Tag.
Im Glasgarten küsst der Mond das Licht.

Nichts duftet geschmacklos die Frucht.
Wer geniesst sie?
Schön...
Im Kristallglas verirrt sich das Licht.

Die Blumen wirken spröde und starr.
Wem sollte ich diese Kälte schenken?
Die Leere zumuten, unmöglich sie zu pflücken.
Sie zerspringen in abertausend Splitter.
Winzige Kristalle, die im Fallen singen.
Den Atem der Elfen begleiten an jedes Ohr,
das bereit ist zu hören.

Und die Blumen wirken spröde.
Ganz unmöglich sie zu pflücken.
Sie zu springen in Kristallen
die im Fallen leise singen.
Und der Atem sanfte Elfen,
die den glanzen Ton begleiten.
Durch den Garten ganz aus Lichten.
An dein Ohr, wenn du denn hören kannst.

Wie alles - klar - glatt - rein.

Getting started really early,
got no time to hesitate
The stars are right to get to hell,
from the dog that bit me back
Break a nose or break a leg,
do you think that I give a damn?
I will never know it's over
I bring the bottom to the blind

There's no bottom when I run,
no tomorrow when I'm done
When you look into that hole,
you discover it destroys the soul
Got no time to die
There's no point to life

And if you judge me
and pointing fingers,
have a look at yourself

Bring me ... and some wine
I behave like a ... swine
... and maybe some booze,
please bring me my running shoes
A tambourine and loads of beer,
you don't wanna be around here
It is something, I had enough
I want more of that brown stone

There's no bottom when I run,
no tomorrow when I'm done
When you look into that hole,
you discover it destroys the soul
Got no time to die
Got no point to life

O-o-oh, a-a-ah
O-o-oh, a-a-ah
O-o-oh, a-a-ah
O-o-oh, a-a-ah

...
...
I've told you once, I've told you twice,
you can never change my life
... and play the blues,
... drinking the booze
But sometimes ...
that's when all hell breaks loose

There's no bottom when I run,
no tomorrow when I'm done
When you look into that hole,
you discover it destroys the soul
Got no time to die
Got no point to life

And if you judge me
and pointing fingers,
have a look at yourself

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?

Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you've lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

Don't want to be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
Hey can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mindfuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well maybe I'm the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't want to be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass, seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk alone
I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a-

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps addin' up, I think I'm crackin' up
Am I just paranoid, am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps addin' up, I think I'm crackin' up
Am I just paranoid? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Go, go
Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps addin' up, I think I'm crackin' up
Am I just paranoid, am I just stoned?

Dear mother, can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks since I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own and I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's still now feeling like my home and I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
It's been six whole months since I have left your home

Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
'Cause you've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment, sleazing my backyard, so don't get
So uptight you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right

So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still-frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Es wird ein wunderbarer Tausch.
Und wenn die Liebe in dir lebt,
verteile sie im ganzen Land.
Hab keine Angst sie zu verlieren.
Gieb jedem etwas davon ab.

Tu's für sie, für ihn, für mich,

schenk sie jemandem der weint.

Ich suche mir ein schönes Plätzchen und dann
Schau ich mir das Feuerwerk an

Du sagst zu mir, ich brauch mal Urlaub
Du sagst, ich brauch mal Raum für mich
Du sagst, ich brauch mal ne Auszeit
Ich sage: "Ne du danke, lass mal!"
Du sagst, wir sollten drüber reden
Bei einem Sojamilchkaffee
Ich brauche niemand, der mir Schaum schlägt
Gib mir ne Kanne TN-Tee

Ich brauche nur ein bisschen Sprengstoff

Mit meinem letzten Funken Verstand
Zünde ich die Zündschnur an
Ich brauche nur ein bisschen Sprengstoff

Und dann fliegt alles in die Luft
Es fliegt alles in die Luft
Und dann fliegt alles in die Luft

Hide your face forever
Dream and search forever

Have you ever been for sale?
When your -isms get smart
Oh, so selfish and mindless
With that comment in your eye

Do you think that you are hard?
Really harder than the other
Man, you're acting cold
If you are not in charge

Don't split your mentality
Without thinking twice
Your voice has got no reason
Now is the time to face your lies

Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god, don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head

Will you offer me some tricks
If I ever need them?
Would you go into that room
If I call 'em

Do you think that you are better
Really better than the rest?
You realize there's a problem
I know that you can give your best

Have you ever had a dream
Or is life just a trip?
A trip without chances
A chance to grow up quick

Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god, don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head

Hide your face forever
Dream and search forever
Night and night, you feel nothing
There's no way outside of my land

Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god, don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head

Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god, don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head

These darkened days and restless nights
Are passing by like never ending years
What is left for me to keep me bearing
Up against this pain
Buried deep inside my soul

And all that's left are memories
These pictures of unworried days
But no one's there to save my legacy
It will just perish, fade with me

No one awaits me, nothing diverts me
This withered body is no empty shell
A dying ember

There is my god to carry me,
But in this world, I needed you

No one awaits me, nothing diverts me
This withered body is no empty shell
And my bright eyes still realize your apathy
My heart beats strong, it still beats strong

There is my god to carry me
But in this world, I needed you

What is left for me to keep me bearing up against this pain
There is no god to ease this pain

No one awaits me, nothing diverts me
This withered body is no empty shell
And my bright eyes still realize your apathy
My heart beats strong, it still beats strong

Nothing to live for
Nothing to fight for
And emptiness fullfills my days

All my hope, a dying ember

Nothing to live for
Nothing to fight for
And emptiness fullfills my days

Just promise me
promise me to hold my hand

They walked and walk among us
And carry on their vile convictions
Education is prevention
This is our struggle, this is our strife

We took just a fight
We were saved and accepted this endeavor
To open eyes, enforce memento, to awake remembrance
It didn't start with carnage
Demolition of all human rights

Against all lies
And versus their oblivion
There will be justice, despite all unconcern
We will find them, for all this apathy
Against all lies we seek for justice
We seek for justice not revenge

No one will stop us, nothing they can do
Blunt trueness will be told
And we will make it heard

Against all lies
We'll make them face their felony
Against all lies
They will meet responsibility

When I'm in this state of mind
I'm wishing I was blind
Sometimes life is more than pain to me

I feel the power of my grief
Death would be such a relief
All the secrets that I hide would die with me

Depression is my only friend
Will this torture never end?
Let me carry on to dreamer's sky

I keep crying in my dreams
Can you hear my endless screams?
When I fade away, I fade away...

This fluid on my cheek
It drains me, I get weak
My heart is cold and bleak
Black blood, black tears
Black tears, black tears

Life is like a masquerade
In debt to myself, but I can't pay
Soon I'll call it all a day, away

I never felt what you call guilt
I still believe "Do what thou wilt"
My sorrow will destroy the world I've built

This fluid on my cheek
It drains me, I get weak
My heart is cold and bleak
Black blood, black tears
Black tears, black tears

Forlorn skies
Their blank eyes stare into a forlorn sky
Disgraceful figures stumble through the mists
Sons of their nations, lost generations
A tragedy beyond imagination

Burnt by the sun, drowned in the rain
Buried alive in this cold, scorched earth

No glory left to find
They all have met their demons
They all have stopped to cry
We're dying for no reason
Forlorn skies
We're dying for no reason

... no reason
... for no reason

The day they marched into this abyss
Wantoness and confidence affended us
And flowers blazoned our doom
We lost our dreams
We lost our dreams

These withered hearts are waiting for the end
Those who return, will never leave this hell again

No glory left to find
They all have met their demons
They all have stopped to cry
We're dying for no reason
Forlorn skies
We're dying for no reason

A merciless horizon
does not promise any hope
Father versus father
Brother against brother
A tomb for all humanity

They all have stopped to cry
We're dying for no reason

Wise words of advice

Insignia of doubtful unions
An untruth factory, the Jesus industry

A preacher in a palace, deriding Luther's fight
Jugglers rise to icons, fiddlers playing saints
Selling hope and worship mammon
Blindness, fear, delusion - their trinity
As you have paid the price, welcome to paradise

Their shadows burnt into the walls
So many lives reduced to ashes
So many homes razed to the ground
A shine like from a thousand suns

Betrayed by their proud leaders
And executed by atrocious enemies
So many homes, so many lives
A silent sense of guilt should rise

A thousand books all full of vindications
Simple explanations, coloured declarations
Where silent sense of guilt should rise
But a victor's story cannot lie

Betrayed by their proud leaders
So many homes, so many lives
A silent sense of guilt should rise

One modest truth they teach their children
Again, a victor's story cannot, it can not lie!

See these branded generations
Hear, their bells are tolling
Hear, hear them calling

Displacing human sense into the afterworld

Running after faint beliefs, where you just have to feel
Conceive suspicion, distrust your faith

Ah!

Degeneration, dislocation and always hunting for the ones to lead you
No aspiration, no ambition

The one you hope for, the one you wait for
Lies in a long forgotten tomb
Condemned and murdered
Revealed and tortured
We have killed him
We have killed him, you and I
We have killed him, you and I

Endless drifting with the stream
And there will be no way to solace

We've raised ourselves to gods
We drank the seas and wiped horizons
Just everything we loved has bled to death by our knives

The one you hope for, the one you wait for
Lies in a long forgotten tomb
Condemned and murdered
Revealed and tortured
We have killed him
We have killed him, you and I
We have killed him, you and I

A deed, that's just too great for us
There is no atonement
And no forgiveness there will be

No atonement

An age that bore no heroes

No answers to the few who raised their questions
Just like a poison, silence killed the truth

A quest for resistance
You're searching for an easy truth
But you betrayed them, they could not trust you

As you marched in lines and circles
As you held your flags up high
They had nowhere to run to
Your heroes, they could not dare to speak to you

But the courage you're reclaiming, it died a bitter death with them
No one here and no one there, no one heard them calling

for years we hide in blackness,
we have to sink into oblivion
this agony of fear absorbs my thinking
this anguish suffocates my souls
I saw countless acts of treason
once this heart was filled with force and comfort
but now there is nothing anymore

the home I knew has crumbled into dust
I know so many of these ruins

I watch it burn, my fatherland
to blood red skies I pray
impatiently I wait, I'm waiting for the end
as I hail the bombs of my saviours

as I'm craving for these sirens wailing
to leave this cell to cross the night
as they crawl into their bunkers
as they hide away and shake with fear

at least I dare to raise my eyes and whisper
I fill my lungs with life again
walking empty streets and orphaned quartiers
a shine like daylight in the light

Fought endless years for their revenge
Now I know this struggle ended nowhere
I am remembering with shame

I feel my time has come to fight for understanding
I'm not defeated, I'm not beaten
Thrown into the darkest dungeon,
I pay for my forgiving thoughts
They may preach about the same convictions,
But they will distort these high ideals

No ferocity will unsettle my beliefs
I am not taken by the enemy
Mechanisms of stagnation
As agitators rule the land

They want to make us live in fear
Yet all they get are unshed tears
They want to make us live in fear
Locked up in gloom for years
Try to silence my voice,
But I'm not beaten!

No brutality will unsettle my beliefs
I am not taken by their felony
Mechanisms of stagnation
As agitators rule the land

And a thousand miles away from home,
I meet my expelled brothers
Captured in a secret prison,
Isolation, regression, indignity for years

No atrocity will unsettle my beliefs
I am not taken by this agony
Mechanisms of stagnation
As agitators rule the land

Welcome to a world of pain
This is the day of your conversion, mortification
Dragged away from home on blood red nights
Slave to a brutal system, forevermore, forevermore

You are an orphan now, adopted by the beast of war
The end of all your childhood dreams has come

No more will you meet a smilling face
Now peace has left your sleep forever
There are no arms to hold you
Yet there are no hands to wipe your tears

Constrained and forced to kill
These cruelties will haunt you, a life in combat
Your fear will make you bleed, your inner combat
A life without a future, you will forget your wishes
And nothing to embrace, but the rifle in your hands, forevermore

You are an orphan now, adopted by the beast of war
The end of all your childhood dreams has come:
A life of combat, forevermore

No more will you meet a smilling face
Now peace has left your sleep forever
There are no arms to hold you
Yet there are no hands to wipe your tears away
There are no arms to hold you
Peace has left your sleep

Depriving me of mercy,refusing all compassion
These bare walls around me
My prison, my dungeon

Deliver me to ransom,
No god can justify this cruelty
There's nothing left for me
There's nothing left but agony

At last break down this dogma
Just let me go, just let me be
Just let it be my last breath
As all peace has left this world

There is serenity given in death
Silence is falling down
So long ago I lost my anchor
As all my sorrows drown

Given in death

The turmoil of this world is not my struggle anymore
The end is putting down its hand for me,
I see, I feel

As all my sorrows drown
Just let me go, just let me be
Just let it be my last breath
Days fade away, songs die away

My peace of mind, given in death
As all peace has left this world
So long ago I lost my anchor
I'm longing for redemption

Enclosed by the mists of oblivion,
Days fade away, songs die away

They felt we'd seize the power
Infamous deeds of desperation
You may take us off the streets,
But nothing stops this righteous rage

Of that there is no doubt
Never forgive, never forget
We know this storm will rage again

I did not choose to tread this path,
A forced journey into an unknown future
As our doom eclipsed this clueless state,
I had to leave my world behind

Their hate was so outright,
It filled my heart with fright
I know only too well
My people chose to welcome tyranny,
The slaves of terror, murder, pain
Humanity lays dying once again

Their hate was so outright,
It filled my heart with fright
I know only too well,
I am an undead poet
Buried in no ground
I know only too well

"Die Heimat hat mir Treue nicht gehalten,
Sie gab sich ganz den bösen Trieben hin
Doch hier wird niemand meine Verse lesen,
Ist nichts, was meiner Seele Sprache spricht;
Ein deutscher Dichter bin ich einst gewesen,
Jetzt ist mein Leben ein Spuk wie mein Gedicht."


Now here I am, disabled but alive
Where no one calls my name
Where nothing meets my soul
Now here I am, but cannot build my home
As no one reads my bitter words

I'm yearning for the day of my return
Yet nothing's there to make my dreams come true
I know only too well,
I am a ghost wandering this world
I'm like a ghost, I know only too well

This outland holds no hope
As no one reads my truly bitter words

Hand to hand we fight
And man by man we die
No sanity is here to find, our god has left this hell
We're wandering like shadows

Once my mind was occupied,
Filled with heroic stories, all glorious tales about this war
But now I know there is no honor here to find
We're marching endlessly, relentlessly, towards the end
A purgatory we walk through, a common grave for all of us
No matter friend or enemy, a forest of the dead

Heart-wrenching cries agonize my soul
Hand to hand we fight
And man by man we die
No sanity is here to find, our god has left this hell

Last days of May, this spring is dying once again,
But we sense this summer may not be ours anymore.
Within these walls, we're loyal brothers,

As cold ashes cover this swaying world in grey.
Inside this fortress, we're faithful sisters,

And their guns annihilate our sanctuaries,

Hilf mir, dass mein Sturm sich legt
Dass meine Flucht endet und weicht
Leih mir einen Mantel, einen Weg
Dass mir eine Richtung bleibt
Und halt mich warm
Mit deinem Feuerlicht
Und halt mich warm
Und vergiss mich nicht

Ich hab nichts mehr zu verlieren
Wenn ich nicht schaff werd ich zur Last
Such einen Platz in deinem Quartier
Und nicht was du gespart hast
Nur etwas Halt in dem Dickicht
Etwas Halt und sonst nichts

Nur eine Minute Ruhe (still)
Nur eine stille Nacht
Die sich kümmert, mich bewacht (still)
Die um mich weiß
Und nicht schweigt

Hast du noch Liebe irgendwo
Steht vielleicht ein bisschen rum
Ich bin der ungebetene Gast
Zersplittert und verstummt
Mein Ass im Ärmel ist durchnässt
Mein Ass im Ärmel ist mein letzter Rest

Nur eine Minute Ruhe (still)
Nur eine stille Nacht
Die sich kümmert, mich bewacht (still)
Die um mich weiß
Und nicht schweigt

Nur eine Minute Ruhe (still)

Die sich kümmert, mich bewacht (still)

Suche einen sicheren Platz

Die sich kümmert, mich bewacht (still)
Die um mich weiß

Ich sage: "Das ist so nicht richtig,
Das heißt 'krankenhausreif', du Blitzlicht.
Du kannst ja noch nich'mal die Sprache auf die du so stolz bist,
Wie witzig, das gibt's nich',
Ich lach mich knittrig, Alter, verpiss dich."
Die Meute hatte zwar kein Hirn, aber Totschläger,
Ich hör nur: "Kameraden, kommt los geht das!"
Übel erwischt, Prügel gekriegt
Und ich dachte noch: "Ich hab die Typen im Griff."

Da hab ich mich mal wieder selbst überschätzt,
Heldenplätze werden echt nur selten besetzt,
Ich war felsenfest der Überzeugung, dass ich die Sache im Griff hab
Und wie immer wenn's so ist endet's bitter.

Da hab ich mich mal wieder selbst überschätzt,
Heldenplätze werden echt nur selten besetzt,
Ich war felsenfest der Überzeugung, dass ich die Sache im Griff hab
Und wie immer wenn's so ist endet's bitter.

Ich sitz in der U-Bahn, der Tag fing ganz gut an,
Doch drei Kiddies kommen rein und hören laut Scooter.
Ich sage: "Ey ihr da, ich will in Ruhe Zug fahr'n,
Macht das leiser, Scooter ist was für Looser."
Einer sagt: "Alter, das ist meine Lieblingsband,
Willst du Krieg, du Hemd? Ich hab die Faust, die dir den Kiefer sprengt.
Ich mach, dass dich niemand wiedererkennt, du solltest lieber renn'!"
Ich sag: "Ey ruhig Kleiner, lass uns liebhaben...öah.
War doch gar nicht so gemeint."
und zweifel insgeheim, an den Kids dieser Zeit.
Sie bau'n sich zu dritt vor mir auf,
Ich sage: "Hey man, das war'n bisschen zu laut
Und im Ernst: Scooter ist doch Lärm, mehr nicht."
Ich spür den ersten Tritt und seh dann Sterne im Kerzenlicht.
Wieso kann ich nicht mal das Maul halten,
Einfach ausschalten, man, das ist ja nicht zum Aushalten.

Da hab ich mich mal wieder selbst überschätzt,
Heldenplätze werden echt nur selten besetzt,
Ich war felsenfest der Überzeugung, dass ich die Sache im Griff hab
Und wie immer wenn's so ist endet's bitter.

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

Gone too far, yea I'm gone again
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
One's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of gin

I'm twenty stories up, yea up at the top
I polished off this bottle, now it's pushing me off
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my momma found my letter, now she's calling the cops

I've got to take this opportunity before I miss it
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred then my wrist is

I've been trying too long with too dull of a knife
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice
I never bought a suit before in my life
But when you go to meet God, you know you want to look nice

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yea I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

We hit the sky, there goes the light
No more sun, why's it always night?
When you can't sleep, well you can't dream
When you can't dream well, what's life mean?

We feel a little pity but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
A mother and a son and someone you know
Smile at each other and realize you don't

You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
What happened to that father, who swore he'd stay
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
Now momma feels guilt, yea momma feels pain

When you were young, you never thought you'd die
Found out you could, but too scared to try
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Climbed to the roof to see you if could fly

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yea, I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

I wish that I could fly
Way up in the sky
Like a bird so high
Oh, I might just try

I wish that I could fly
Way up in the sky
Like a bird so high
Oh, I might just try
Oh, I might just try

I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back

Down in the dirt with your blood on my hands
I blacked out, but now I do understand
That you were too good for this world so you left it
Everything turned red and then you made an exit
I don't even know if it was your time
But like all good things that pass you by
It's like a lost soul in the time of need
It made me grow up fast and put some blood on my knees
And you don't even know what's beyond you
Thinking you could never die like you're bulletproof
So I guess you had to leave, you were born with wings
But you were never happy til the angels sing

I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down

I'm ashes to ashes, I'm dust to dust
And when a man turns to ashes, forget about love
Like the feeling inside you with the bottle beside you
You both end up empty like an angel just died too
I look to the heavens, to the sky and the rest
I looked inside myself, I felt my heart in my chest
Something so point blue, there's nothing to say
Some hearts to stay true when falling away
Come lay down beside me, what you and I mean
It's only what I've seen it's only just one dream
Tell my baby I love her, and I wish I could hold her
It's hard to say goodbye when you know that it's over

I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
One day, one day, I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down (down)

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back down

I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
One day, one day, I know you're coming back down

(Now now now now now)
(Now now now now now)

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife from my chest
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find
But maybe I won't because I left it all behind

Now I'm stuck with this and that'll never change
Always a part of me until the very last day
Where to go from here, what road to travel on
I spent my whole life choosing and it always chose wrong

Will I try to have the will to be alive
Will I try 'cause I've never seen the light
Blow it to the ground and it's now you see
You spent your whole life taking the best of me

Where'd you go
Where's your home
How'd you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There's no light
There's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

(Now now now now now)

How low can I keep pretending to be
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees
A man of many words but a man of few deeds

Walking these streets so absent of hope
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home
Lend him a hand then we'll walk him the way
Leave the virtue of pity but we live with the shame

So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
When you wake up you know it's darker than last night
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life

Where'd you go
Where's your home
How'd you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There's no light
There's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

Look into my eyes and I see
What do I see
Nothing at all (nothing at all)

Take another look around me
What do I see
Nothing at all

(Now now now now now)
(Now now now now now)

Where'd you go
Where's your home
How'd you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There's no light
There's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

(Now now now now now)

Can you hear me

Can't stop, I need some help
Fuck you, I'm by myself
Is it a truth or lie?
It's what you can't deny
'Cause it's the way you think
Mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way you are
Float up till you're close to God
You know that hiding ain't gonna keep you safe
Because the tears on your face, they leak and leave a trace (trace)
So just when you think that true love's begun
It goes off at any second just like a loaded gun

You know I can take you straight to Heaven, if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate, if you let me
Know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate-tate
I can make you body levitate, le-levitate, you know

Can't stop the feeling, high as the ceiling
I've got the money, who's fuckin' dealin'?
You feel the heat, like a barrel of a gun
I forgot the last time I saw the sun
We've got this disease, it's diggin' deeper in me
It's like my mind is leaving, but my heart keeps beating
So I'll paint the walls red, drip from the nose
Where it goes, nobody really knows
Hit the bottle, shoes on to follow
I fall asleep, there ain't no tomorrow
Gone too far, no one to save me
Who needs you when I got my baby?
My baby's beautiful, she loves me true
And if she dies, I hope I die too

You know I can take you straight to Heaven, if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate, if you let me
Know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate-tate
I can make you body levitate, le-levitate, you know

I put down another sack of them
Then it's straight back to the flask again
I can't help stop what's happening
On the wrong track, yeah, I'm back again
Up shit's creek and I'm paddlin'
Blacked out room and I'm travelin'
Good ideas, I'm lackin' them
I'm too fucked up now I'm babblin'
Wondering how to fix these damages, all these goddamn damages
Cover myself with bandages from all these d-dam-damages
Wondering how to fix these damages, all these goddamn damages
Cover myself with bandages from all these goddamn damages

You know I can take you straight to Heaven, if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate, if you let me
Know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate-tate
I can make you body levitate, le-levitate, you know

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a madman, the voices keep asking
Born with a soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around, I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they're digging up my grave
An Undead one like the flag that I wave

I'm not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness
The day of the dead, and you're on our hit list
So come, all you misfits, bitch, you're on our hit list!

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost, so long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that cannot be
Let this dagger cut jaggedly while you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag, I see you all laughing so happily

It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no saving your heart
This is the day of the dead, this ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
When I'm done, I ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow
'Cause it's hell that follows

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost, so long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

When the ashes start to rise and the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry, on the plains below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost, so long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

Hold on holy ghost
It's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost
It's the day of the dead

Hold on holy ghost
(Here's to the Damned)'
It's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost
(Here's to the Damned)
It's the day of the dead

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

How can I sleep at night? There's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
'Cause I am a lion and you are dead

Here's a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide but some of us can never leave
And if you go I don't need those little things
That remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words? All I can say
We can watch the world, even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You were born a lion and a lion you will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Remember an army of all those little kids?
Living life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle and
I'd rather die, won't watch you givin' in
I'm sorry daughter but your father's not the same
I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain

After all, only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once you walk away
Promise that you'll love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave
The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tear it all to pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
'Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home

Hey

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin' in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we're built from broken parts

If you can lose it all then welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams and your name on the marquee
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly
It's hotter here in hell but it's gettin' real dark, see
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you're walkin' on my dreams
Every breath, another breath, you're breathin' when I breathe

I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go
I'm married to the devil in this city of angels
So come all you wicked to the world of the empty
I know I need it all, so baby don't tempt me
I'm knockin' on your door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checkin' all you bitches like I'm checkin' this check sheet
So put your hats on, Lohner don't get soft
You can see God when I take my mask off

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin' in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we're built from broken parts

The fame's your best friend, you love it; no questions
Beatin' down the door is the face of rejection
And once again it's a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessin'
But who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen
With the gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face; he doesn't think he can die

So grab a pick and an axe 'cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack and we die inside
So when you look in his eyes, whatcha see now? (See now?)
Murder the monster you've made and watch him bleed out
We're in a life where it's kill or lose
Just lie, motherfucker, till you hear the truth
From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talkin' to you

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin' in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we're built from broken parts

(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what's ours) Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that You gave us
(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what's ours) Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that You gave us

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin' in the dark
'Cause we are, we are, we're built from broken parts

(We are, we are) From the city of angels
An empty vessel of devils
(We are, we are) Is there no one to save us?
Look through my eyes, see the world that You gave us
(And our hearts, our hearts) From the city of angels
An empty vessel of devils

Wake up, grab beer, grab rear, shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up
Break up with my girlfriend, so I can bang sluts
I'm undead, unfed, been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined

Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping

When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
Hoes want to be seen with me, and I like their big thick titties
D-cups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
Calm down, it's just a hickey
I'll blame it on this whiskey sipping, gets me tipsy
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz, take back streets to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home, but your friends won't let ya
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta
Buy beer or pay the rent, my signing bonus was quickly spent
So I'll beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher

Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping

Let's get this party jumping, let's see some 40 chugging
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick when I start buzzing
Come on, girls, I wanna see you drinking
I wanna see your brain start shrinking
Make a move, I saw you winking
Drunken pussies, what I'm thinking
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night 'til they call the cops
Fuck a wrist band, let's all do a keg stand
I'm like Cheech without the Chong, hitting up the beer bong
When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger
And I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the designated drinker

Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)

You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it

What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kids lips
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit

While we walk through empty streets
You calmed our heart beats
We see them

Rocks and bushes fall apart
A fetal lost their path
We form
We lose

This desert it will never end
Our thirst is never filled
Let's move on

Purple sky is above our heads
Illuminated aeroplanes
We run
They follow

We can try
Sure we die
But we can share
Some safety
Some fear

Memories and thoughts are gone
Brightest whitened minds
Don't talk

I am watching windows
You pull the blindfolds down
We know it
We find it

Animals have left their homes
Trees grow upside down
We have our hands

We'll hide inside a big fish
Listen to the choir
The seaside is waiting

We can try
For sure we die
But we can share
Some safety
Some fear

It is clear we'll fall from grace
we cannot walk away
away from each other.

Medicate my heart

its just wrong we stay.
the coldest part has come.
We built a perfect place
and pictured each other.

We are whitest sheets
Let's write the streets

Could you sit with me?
Under the icicles
Give me your trembling hands
I don't wear kid gloves
This darkness is complete
Please don't say a word

Oh we will stumble
but that's the way we walk.
Please tell me everything
and maybe in the end
we 'll even have lost the fear.

And will you come?

While you are searching me, my work is done
Please tell nobody that I am real
They will run over you
It will never heal

You must forget

Lies this in between certain kind of regret

I see them side to be wide
On the birds of the flowers

I will not move
But the wind is blowing
In the fields


I see them side to be wide

But the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing

And in the end you came to late
Let's talk to my hair
I guess that's a fate
I will grow fast
The highest tree in the field
You bark up at last

I close my eyes,
Recognize your steps at the meadow

I will make a single noise
In my lovely cave

Carry on. Overcome.

The lies that floods our compromise. The day is getting darker.
Your past that fuels the pain inside. You can rise above it.
If you've fallen to your knees, don't give up just yet.

We will overcome anything and everything standing in our way.
Let go of all the things that keep us from pressing on.

Lift your head from the soil, lift your head from the toil. Breathe in life and move forward.
Breathe in life and move forward.
Breathe in life and move forward.

Set apart to succeed beyond what we can dream.
Watch us rise. Watch us rise! We will shatter negativity.
Watch us rise. Watch us rise! We will shatter negativity.

'Cause we were made for more.
I know that we were made to overcome anything and everything standing in our way.
Let go of all the things that keep us from pressing on.

Lift your head from the soil, lift your head from the toil.
Breathe in life and move forward.

In the wake of the one's we lost, we'll let their legacy live through us.

We will bring fire to the empires. The imperial, they won't prevail.
We will raise. Raise that banner above it all. While they weep and wail.
And we turn our heads and look away.

Redemptive violence, take a seat right where you stand.
Humanity, we are destroying ourselves again, ourselves again.
Humanity, we are destroying ourselves. Humanity, we are destroying ourselves.
And I am no longer possessed by my possessions, that have costs behind my eyes.
Exploitation of innocence.

We spit in their faces, to keep ours looking prime.
We starve them of their freedom, freedom, to feed our lavish lives.
We put a price on their worth, to finance our greed.
And blindly pledge to a flag, when justice lies in a King.

We will bring fire to the empires. The imperial, they won't prevail.
We will raise. Raise that banner above it all. While they weep and wail.
We will not, we will not be deceived, deceived.

I hurt myself today to see if I still feel. I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting. Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.

What have I become my sweetest friend? Everyone I know goes away in the end.
And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt.

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair. Full of broken thoughts that I cannot repair.
Beneath the stains of time the feelings disappear. You are someone else. I am still right here.

Cadences of disdain, melodies without satisfaction.
But the only thing, the only thing I have is time.

Risk lays the foundation of my destiny, destiny.
Risk lays the foundation of my destiny.

And if it crumbles, at least I know I tried. I can stand on that. Instead of questioning why...
Instead of questioning why I never chased down the man I want to be.
Buried deep inside of me is the door to what I'm meant to be.
And I,
I hold the key.

I met myself in a dream. Innocent, adamant, adolescent me.
Don't turn your back on me. Don't turn your back on me.

This regret won't tear through me (tear through me).
I'd rather fail, I'd rather fail than fail to be, myself.

"Give up yourself and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it."

"Even in literature or art no man who cares about originality will ever be original.
It's the man who's only thinking about doing a good job or telling the truth who becomes really original, but doesn't notice it.
Even in social life, you never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking what sort of impression you make.
That principle runs all through life from the top to the bottom.
Give up yourself and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it.
Submit to death, submit with every fiber of your being and you will find eternal life."

It's monumental for us to rise to the surface, just to breathe in some reality.
We've been drowning in uncertainty.

Years gone by. When will we try not living for ourselves, not living for man.

The world, the world I see in front of me is full of things that should not be, that should not be.

When will we change? When will we see who we are living for?
Are you living for yourself or something greater? It's in your hands, be the creator.

For the dead and the living we must all bear witness.
The lives we lead are filled with uncertainty, but no hope means no reality.
Get it, hope is a reality.
The lives we lead are filled with uncertainty. Open your eyes, see the dark, find the light.

Torn to shreds by monotony, but not today.

Threading through my faith with a needle named doubt.
Putting it all together and then tearing it apart.
Throwing away the scraps and trying to restart.
Go back to the days when it was sunny and clean.
My soul stormed until it stopped trying to shine.
It settled for hazy messages from a black sky.
I still don't know why, know why.
No question I threw up, came back, and I don't know why.
Is this what I wanted to be? A restless soul wrestling with what I believe.
Or just a selfish soul blind to problems that tower over me, over me, that tower over me.

Slow fade out. Sun burn and stay out. Clouds close like a mouth. 'Round last light and sound.
Don't bother, save your breath. Could be the last you get.

They present deceit, packaged with lies, and try to unravel my demise.

I have to drive them out of my life. Pull the trigger on oppression. I'm ready to fight.

Everyone's telling me to focus on my dreams, but I can't lift my head from the suffering below.
Sometimes I feel like there's no hope for mankind.
Strapped down to tradition, chained to the lies we've been fed.
Has this gone too far? Can we sever the hand of power hanging over our heads?

We can take them all. Let them line up against our generation that says no.
We're not standing for this. We're bringing you to your knees. Turn your back on everything.
To expose the lies and greed that you beg us to buy into.

I know they're all,

Question everything, 'cause nothing's what it seems.
And they gave fake a face, force-fed the American dream.
Shipped us overseas to be all we can be. We can't justify murder with freedom isn't free.

He walks the stairs and stands at the door.
Bottle in his right,
Fist in his left clenched tight.
He's already trampled over his wife.
The beginning of his family's demise
As he stares into his little girl's eyes,
His little girl's green eyes.
And to her surprise he actually came home tonight.
But he's still not acting right.

He knows better, but he's never experienced it.
It's a night much like when he was young.
Mama's on the floor again
Yelling "I love you"s at the man standing above her
Who can only respond with violence.
He notices the similarities, and begins to scream off the balcony:

"I will never be like you, I will always despise you.

Betrayer, where is your head?
Betrayer, where is your heart?
Betrayer, I will never be like you.
Betrayer, I will always despise you.

Betrayer, where is your head?

He's still outside screaming into the wind
About his distaste for his former kin.
His evil thoughts are pushing him to the edge
And now he's flirting with that ledge.

Those green eyes look at him from behind,
She's begging him to change his mind.
He shows his back to those that he loves,
When he dives headfirst into the earth.

He buries his head, hiding it from the world.
Then screams his little girl.

"I will always despise you.

Betrayer, where is your head?

I'm sick of waiting around for nothing, for nothing.
Why am I wasting my time?
I will not build my legacy on earth,
My legacy will not be of this world.
I will not build my legacy on earth,
My legacy will be too large for this soil.
My whole life I've been compared to those around me,
Expectations on my shoulder and people to please.

I will no longer sway with the willows.
I will stand strong on my own.
When everyone lets me down,
I will stand strong alone,

I will no longer sway with the willows.
I will stand strong on my own.
When everyone lets me down,
I will stand strong alone,

I will no longer sway with the willows.
I will stand strong on my own.
When everyone lets me down,
I will stand strong alone,

Stand strong alone.
Stand strong alone.
I will stand strong alone.
I will stand strong alone.
I will stand strong alone.

And when the winds hurl, I will not move.
I'm destined for greatness,
I'll see it through,
I'll see this through.
We will see this through.

Album  When Will We Surrender
Hab in der Öde festgesessen
Das Leben war so fern
Die Flügel gebrochen
Ich konnte mich nicht wehren

Der Teufel lud zum Tanze ein
Und ich sagte viel zu selten: "Nein!"

Hab das alles schon gesehen
Wie es kommt und wie es geht
Hab das alles schon erlebt
Die Welt dreht sich weiter

Die Nacht war hell
Und schien durch meine Augenlider
Flog höher als der Rest der Welt
Und fand mich dann am Abgrund wieder

Der Teufel lud zum Tanze ein
Und ich sagte viel zu selten: "Nein!"

Hab das alles schon gesehen
Wie es kommt und wie es geht
Hab das alles schon erlebt
Die Welt dreht sich weiter

Ich lauschte den Sirenen
Und gab mein ganzes Glück
Doch sie lockten nicht nur mich
Das brach mir das Genick

Hab das alles schon gesehen
Wie es kommt und wie es geht
Hab das alles schon erlebt
Die Welt dreht sich weiter

Auch ohne mich

Das Mädchen auf dem Besen
Kommt des Nachts zu mir geflogen
Das Mädchen mit dem Besen
Fühl mich magisch hingezogen

Komm ins Haus, kehr Kummer aus
Bring herein was beide sehnen
Ein Leben in Saus und Braus
Lass uns nun vom Himmel nehmen

Du kennst bestimmt das schönste Spiel
Komm, setz dich auf den Besenstiel

Hexe, Hexe, ja du fegst durch meine Nacht
Kommst herein und es wird laut
Zeigst mir deine weiße Haut
Hexe, Hexe, ja du fegst durch meine Nacht
Belladonna, heißes Blut
Freude schürt den Funkenflug

Du Mädchen mit dem Besen
Bist die eine, die ich meine
Du verflucht schönes Wesen
Trägst wie ich dieselben Steine

Du öffnest mir den Garten Eden
Liegst aufgegrätscht, du böses Mädchen
Machst dir dort mein Leid zu eigen
Du schönste der Himmelsgeigen

Du kennst bestimmt das schönste Spiel
Komm, setz dich auf den Besenstiel

Hexe, Hexe, ja du fegst durch meine Nacht
Kommst herein und es wird laut
Zeigst mir deine weiße Haut
Hexe, Hexe, ja du fegst durch meine Nacht

Ich greif das Licht mit beiden Händen
Trink es aus dem großen Glas
Will damit im Dunkeln blenden
Ohne Zeit und Maß

Sing von hellen Sonnenstrahlen
Von Überfluss und Lichterzahlen
Hab den Mantel der Nacht besprochen
Und heut sogar den Mond zerbrochen

Wenn ich die Sonne schlafen schick
Blicke ich nicht mehr zurück
Ich schaue in das dunkle Meer
Ergebe mich, mein Kopf ist leer

Ich sammle Sterne, Wolkenschleier
Web daraus ein weißes Tuch
Damit fühle ich mich freier
Welch ein Fluch

Doch morgens früh, da schwanke ich
Mein schweres Haupt hängt im Genick
Mach darunter einen Strich
Wenn ich die Sonne schlafen schick

Es ist schon lang nach Mitternacht
Der Jäger liegt noch auf der WAcht
Zu holen seinen eigenen Teil
Das ist fürwahr nicht allen feil

Begehr ich eines, dann bist es du
Zieh sanft die Schlinge um dich zu
In meinen Klauen sollst du sein
Heute Nacht nur bist du mein

Die Glieder starr, der Körper rege
Weil er die eine fassen will
Er lauert einsam im Gehege
Das Herz es rast, der Rest steht still

Begehr ich eines, dann bist es du
Zieh sanft die Schlinge um dich zu
In meinen Klauen sollst du sein
Heute Nacht nur bist du mein

Der Duft, er flimmert laut im Kopf
Der Wolf heult auf nur zum Begehren
Die eine Beute heute Nacht
In Liebe zu verzehren

Begehr ich eines, dann bist es du
Zieh sanft die Schlinge um dich zu
In meinen Klauen sollst du sein
Heute Nacht nur bist du mein

Wer doof ist, glaubt was andere sagen
Ja, der muss auch ständig fragen
Wer doof ist, der hat nie gelesen
Ist auch nie am Meer gewesen
Wer doof ist, dem ist nix zu teuer
Der versäuft auf See die Heuer
Wer doof ist, der zahlt jeden Preis
Glaubt den Weibern jeden Scheiß'

Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand
Wer ist der Dümmste im ganzen Land
Im Reich der Blinden bist du ein König
Doch die Zwerge stört das wenig

Wer doof ist, kann nicht richtig kochen
Der versalzt sich seinen Tee
Zieht im stärksten Schnupfen
Durch die Nase kalten Schnee
Wer doof ist, der hat keine Olle
Ja, der kann auch keine Rolle
Wer doof ist, ist gefährlich
Doch unter'm Strich so ehrlich

Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand
Wer ist der Dümmste im ganzen Land
Im Reich der Blinden bist du ein König
Doch die Zwerge stört das wenig

Wer doof ist, der kommt nie gelegen
Ist döfer noch als manch ein Tier
Wer doof ist, stellt sich in den Regen
Und ich verschenk' mein letztes Bier

Ich seh' nichts
Ich spüre nichts von dir
Ich hör' nichts
Ich fühle nichts bei dir

Du fragst nicht
Ich sage nichts von mir
Ich weiß nur
Ich will alles von dir

Kannst du mir sagen, wohin der Wind uns weht?
Wie dieser Film zu Ende geht?

Auf meinem Weg, auf der Suche nach dem Leben
Rast die Welt an mir vorbei
Ich ziehe rastlos durch die Straßen
Und verliere mich dabei

Ich erträum dich
Will zum Schein nur bei dir sein
Ich umzäun mich
Bin doch nicht gern allein

Du fragst mich
Bist du mein?
Es erfreut mich
Nur einen Moment in dir zu sein

Kannst du mir sagen: "Wie weit muss ich noch gehen?"
Bleibt denn der Zeiger niemals stehen?

Wir beide schau'n uns an
Ein Herz und eine Seele
Ziehst mich in deinen Bann
Wir schreien's aus einer Kehle
Vor uns liegt ein weiter Weg
Ist nur einer von so vielen
Egal ob früh, ob spät
Lass uns mit dem Feuer spielen

Immer wenn die Sonne untergeht
Immer wenn der Mond am Himmel steht
Verbrennen wir zusammen (Wo-Ho)
Im hellen Schein der Flammen (Wo-Ho)
Immer wenn sich Tag und Nacht vereint
Immer wenn das Licht des Feuers scheint
Verbrennen wir zusammen (Wo-Ho)
Im hellen Schein der Flammen (Wo-Ho)

Das Ziel liegt auf der Hand
Bis ans Ende dieser Welt
Mit dem Kopf durch jede Wand
In den Abgrund wie ein Held
Lass uns Uhren rückwärts dreh'n
Durch den Regenbogen laufen
Durch Nadelöhre geh'n
Und uns neu im Feuer taufen

Immer wenn die Sonne untergeht
Immer wenn der Mond am Himmel steht
Verbrennen wir zusammen (Wo-Ho)
Im hellen Schein der Flammen (Wo-Ho)
Immer wenn sich Tag und Nacht vereint
Immer wenn das Licht des Feuers scheint

Die bunten Tücher sind zerknüllt
Die Manege vollgemüllt
Das Riesenrad quietscht rostig im Wind
Im letzten Sommer trug es noch ein Kind
Welch' Augenblicke voller Lachen
Jauchzen und Freudengeschrei
Nun haben wir andere Zeiten
Die alten brach das Schicksal einst entzwei

Es tut so, es tut so, es tut so weh
Es tut so weh wenn ich die Gaukler weinen seh
Es rührt mich, berührt mich und ich gesteh
Es tut so gut, wenn ich dein Lachen wieder seh

Ich hauche in die Hände, die Kälte tut weh
Klopf auf die Jacke, weg mit dem Schnee
Im Schuppen - die goldene Robe
Sie zierte des Clowns Garderobe
Die Farben in seinem Gesicht
Hat der dunkle Regen verwischt

Es tut so, es tut so, es tut so weh
Es tut so weh wenn ich die Gaukler weinen seh
Es rührt mich, berührt mich und ich gesteh
Es tut so gut, wenn ich dein Lachen wieder seh

Des Gauklers Tränen nässt das Lachen
Welches neu zu säen wär
Dieses Feuer stets entfachen
Ist Herzensblut und Spielmannsehr

Im Himmel zwischen Weiß und Blau
Mag sein, dass es dort biblisch ist
Hier unten sind die Katzen grau
Denn wer nur schläft, der auch nicht frisst

Auf Wolken zirpen Harfen zart
Dort soll man schon am Morgen singen
Hier unten scharfe Suppe gart
Und hin und wieder Gläser klingen

Am Feuer wird man nie bestohlen
Hier unten schippt der Teufel Kohlen

Ja, das haben wir uns geschworen
Im Himmel haben wir nichts verloren
Ja, das haben wir uns geschworen
Denn das Laster hat uns auserkoren

Wo ein lustiges Feuer prasselt
Lässt man sich doch gerne nieder
Denn wer beichtet, der vermasselt
Da sing ich lieber Lästerlieder

Nun frag ich euch was besser ist
Ich glaub, die Antwort fällt nicht schwer
Das kräht ein jeder Hahn vom Mist
Denn wie der Herr so sein Gescherr

Lass hör'n, gesagt, getan
Ja ich hab 'nen Plan
Wir brauchen Hirn, 'ne Leiter, Zwirn

Dumme Wächter könn' uns mal
Grinsend hieft empor die Meute
Im Kerzenschein die fette Beute
Was hinter Eisentüren verschlossen
Wird ohne Eintrittsgeld genossen
Wir wühlen in Gold und Edelsteinen
Durch Freigeist in zarten Reimen

Ich feiere täglich Riesenfeste
Ich bin der Schlaueste auf der Welt
Weil jeder Tag auf Sonntag fällt
Im Lügenbett aus Redewut

Schlafe göttlich ohne Qual
Und lass euch stehen im Jammertal

Und dann schau ich in die Ferne
Ja so hab ich, hab ich mich gerne

Unter Palmen am weißen Strand
Bin ich charmant und abgebrannt
Ich bin ein echter Lebemann

Ich bin der Typ, der nie was übrig lässt
Der Duft an meiner Backe haftet fest
Trag' in der Hose schärfste Waffen
Und auch Lack wie andere Affen
Ich bin Pilot, bin Tiefseetaucher
Bin Vollidiot und Kettenraucher
Kenn keinen Verdruss nicht bis zum Schluss
Schöpfe aus der Leere Überfluss

Ja so hab ich, hab ich mich gerne

Jenem Weg entgegen
Der nie infrage kam
Durch Sonnenschein und Regen
Hält uns der Aufbruch warm
Der Atem in der Sommerluft
Den Schritt zur Erde zwingt
Gestern nannte man uns Schuft
Nur, weil es einfach klingt

Wir schauen nur nach vorne
Und nicht zurück
Wir schauen nach vorne
Denn alles was wir wollen ist das große Glück

Und wir laufen über Wege ohne Namen
Wir sind frei und treiben mit dem Wind
Und wir laufen, tausend Träume in den Armen
Sind dabei, denn nur wer wagt gewinnt

Wir setzen uns auch nieder
Weil wir von weither kamen
Denken an die Lieder
Die all das vor uns sahen
Wie oft haben wir gesungen
Von diesem Moment
Und immer drum gerungen
Weil jenes Fernweh brennt

Wir schauen nur nach vorne
Und nicht zurück
Wir schauen nach vorne
Denn alles was wir wollen ist das große Glück

Und wir laufen über Wege ohne Namen
Wir sind frei und treiben mit dem Wind
Und wir laufen, tausend Träume in den Armen
Sind dabei, denn nur wer wagt gewinnt

Ich brauche keine Krone
Kein Palast, kein Edelstein
Wo immer ich auch wohne
Ist mir jederorts ein Heim

Ich bin ein Strolch
Doch bin ich frei
An mir geht dieser Kelch vorbei

Frei zu sein
Bedarf es wenig
Nur wer frei ist
Ist ein König
Schamlos nimmt der dreiste Dieb
Denn er ist seines Glückes Schmied

Wovon die Andern träumen
Raub ich in der Nacht
Mein Gang gleicht einem Hochzeitsschimmel
Ein furchtloser König
Von Söldnern bewacht
Ein eigener Gott, in meinem Himmel

Frei zu sein
Bedarf es wenig
Nur wer frei ist
Ist ein König
Schamlos nimmt der dreiste Dieb
Denn er ist seines Glückes Schmied

Ein Ei nicht dem andern gleicht
Manch einer hat gewettet
Der Strolch schlägt 7 auf einen Streich
Man schläft wie man sich bettet

Frei zu sein
Bedarf es wenig
Nur wer frei ist
Ist ein König
Schamlos nimmt der dreiste Dieb
Denn er ist seines Glückes Schmied

Save all your prayers
I think we lost today
There's no morning after
And no one's around to blame

I'm not afraid to bleed
But I won't do it for you
A star among hypocrites
The melody of our time

So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the earth

Scream your lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
Here's the next disaster!

What decides when you've lost the war?
When the first man falls?
Or when they've erased it all?

We're too numb to feel
The downfall starts right here
Hold your breath and swim
Swallowed by life's tears

In times of make believe
No one really seems to care
Maybe I should care less
'cause I'll die too

So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the earth

Scream your lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
Here's the next disaster!

What will it take for us to realize
The more we provoke
Winter will come twice

Save all your prayers
I think we lost today
There's no morning after
And no one's around to blame

Scream you lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
Here's the next disaster!

It burns, it rips, it hurts
They make you bleed your turn
The chance of a lifetime
How does it feel to be alive?

A tear for the poet

What now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide-and-seek
I call on you to take me on

Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn my efforts
In the end, it means nothing

Make me understand the thought, whatever

Don't forsake my troubled times
I'm starting to regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again

I will be reborn

I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will
I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will

Throw it all away
Afraid I will drift on the open sea
I regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again

Where I have nothing
Fearless and whole
Find out what you are
Back in time

No
I won't
I need this
Truth is...

Once you had enough
Break out
Room to breathe
To love
Before you're gone

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
Everything's gone

Where I have nothing
There's no hate
Room to breathe
No envy and nothing to lose

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
Everything's gone

Once you had enough
Break out

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down

We're all in this together
Or so I was told
All for one, one for none

When it's time
You know this could never be justified
But still you take the hatred home

Or is this what you were searching for?
The wounded and its filtered truth
Don't ignore a life that's real

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

You're battered against the world, you knew
A place to hide from everything
And it had to make you fall

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

The fire
My heads all wired
In plain view
There's nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny
But just a little spark and once again... I don't know

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear

Are we the only ones?
It's all dark in here
Do I just waste my time?
Searching for exits in infinite space

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

All the lights
All the lights
Is that the future or another lullaby?

The fire
My heads all wired
In plain view
There's nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny
But just a little spark and once again... I don't know

Deep inside

Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

Close my eyes

Without the sense of space or time
The infinite
The endless static
The doubt. We never had a way

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Tormented minds they wander
Drifting away from the light
I will lift you up my friend
You have to learn to breathe again

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Unlock the secrets
Let us find the memories
Find ourselves some ruins
Turn them into something

You are lost within
Fading out
A world that threw you away

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Vultures descend
Feeding on us
There's no sympathy

Breeding the hate

Turn away
Run away
From all the things we have to do

And it tears away our hearts and our soul

It's like we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
Rewind
There's no time
The wasteland.... It's an indication

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

That we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
This time
We have found the wasteland

You want someone to blame
The one who drives the rusted nail
But who's left will never care
Pretending becomes a chore
All you search for, a little piece of mind
Too far, too deep, the two faced smile
So lost, you feel, I know

Wide awake but still asleep
Always a stranger in a crowd (Sleep, sleep, sleep)
Wide awake, always a stranger in a crowd (Wake, wake, wake)

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
I'm there until the end of time

Leave the doomed behind
Search with different light
You were trying to remember
But it's all make believe

You are, you are, you are

Wide awake but still asleep (Wide awake but still asleep)
Always a stranger in a crowd

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
I'm there until the end of time

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want, I'm there

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
I'm there until the end of time

How far until the edge?
These wrong ways are mine
But the whole world can just go to hell
This life is killing me
My feelings inside I can't explain
I'm awake, but not for long

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

I gave you the story of my life
Some of my precious time
But I'm tired of this
With every promise of eternal light
Another feeling dies

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

False affection took the best of me
Deep inside, the absent mind
Denial and hypocrisy
All this the same
To do this we part our ways

My destination, my mission, my intuition
so close I feel it changing me
Suddenly I know, I have to let it go

All that's been lost, all that's been won
Now I feel right before me
Intentions are pure, I'm out of reach

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe
And I have wings (I have)
Nothing and everything at the same time
Oh, a brighter sun

Save me from my fears
And darkest thought of her
Carry me through times
Through oblivion

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me

In the darkest of nights
You are my endless fire inside
Across the waters and back to shore
Through space in time, you guide me

Afraid there's not much time
Life's a matter of moments
Face the truth
That I cannot run
I always known

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know, dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine
Come lay with me

Face the truth, that I cannot run

A fate that we deserve
There's no escape
We're walking backwards
I'm on your side
But life's a selfish thing
Like broken promises

A thousand times
Try to fake it
Just another liar

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

How come we walk a mile
Just to shatter what we love?
Eyes wide open
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
Saying - You know you are heading -

The lost dream
Of what could have been
It makes no difference

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

I dreamed that you've died
I'm forever alone
I'm weak and I'm frightened
This brings about a change
Thing you said to me
Believe and things you might find
Will turn into a march

I stand along and breath again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Feel a sudden haze
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions
I swear to you
It will never be the same
It's not straight but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

I stand along and breath again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sun rise again

Erase darkness from from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

Until the world ceases to move
That burning feeling
Let me go
This is real
Always one more thing
I clench my hands and bang my head

Take whatever comes to you
All the while,
I don't need another friend

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can get you all that you lost

I never told
Blessed is the sick in me
I'm dying alone
We stand to fight for nothing
Without a thought, a reason
It will never be okay

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can get you all you lost

A growing pain
It's hard to say what brought the darkest burden
For some of us there's no answer

Chains are breaking
I won't let this build up inside me
There's a storm coming
But I'll serve no more
'Till my very last breath

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It's all for me now
I'm sure that one day
I can get you all you lost

September's here again
Every insecurity reminds you
Who's at the helm?
Darker times
With fear in the eyes
Who's the man in charge?

Invented isolation
Alone and safe inside
Struggle with words
That make sense in time
Yet waiting for someone to enter

Say,
I have a better plan
I have a better plan
I have a better plan

Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It's fine we're living the lie

When light breaks
Another way to matter
All questions somehow answered
When life comes crushing
At the early break of day
We've only come so far

Never have to worry
For all that we know
Truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now
It's fine we're living the lie

(Never have to worry for all that we know)
(Truth be told)
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in for now

Need some space

I need for you to pick me up
When I fall down
There's so much more
We can go far
But I can't control my selfish ways

Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you

Who's the man in front of me?

I'm blindfolded, I can't see
Need a reason, I'm left empty

This inner apathy  brings me to life
I know it's strange and it's draining me

At least you could have tried
It is way past time and we're scattering ashes
You take everything in sight, please hear me now
You, you are leaving me with scars

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We're losing identity
Faith has been denied let's not pretend
This is the first time we just don't belong

What world do you perceive?
All turn cold, no one cares for anyone
Waiting for a final blow
Do you have strength at all?
One more day then we fade away

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be

Don't dare to face you all alone

With a box of T-shirts and some records to sell

Thanks for everything

Tomorrow is too late

Close your eyes

And everything you ask for

I found the way and I'll return here soon
I have to see those who don't know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

If today was your last day
Would that change a thing?

You probably believe what you told them
Live each moment like your last

You got the mindset of a killer

We are ghosts of a concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?

Staring into bright lights
I am what I've done
It's useless to hide
An empty chamber
Guess I was part of a plan

We are ghosts of a concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

We're running out of time
Can't seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place
Counting down the days
Beginning of the end

We are ghosts of a concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?

There is someone in the attic
Building a strange machine
Never really seen him
But I think he works all day

Blinded by the world outside
I stay inside
Hardly know my name
But it's getting better by time

I saw something in the mirror
Someone's watching me
If I hide in the attic
He will never get to me

I found some rope on the floor
I have to build a trap
So I started on my machine
I'm never to be seen

Walls are closing in
And there I was cursing the ground
Unable to understand

I won't let the world break me
So I need to change direction
Nothing special and far from perfect
Light the way for me

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

Walking where the dead ships dwell
These are shores I left behind
Streets were getting smaller and I had to leave

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

All I hear is noise
Hearts of false hope
Guess I took it all for granted
I know I went too far
I won't say I'm sorry
I got what I deserved
I got what I deserved

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside

I'm fading away from here
I'm fading away from here

We're fading away from here

I'm fading away from here, can't see nothing here.
Even though I'm awake, my body slowly breaks.
Feels so cold that I shake, every time I reflect.
These stories I'm writing to verse they sure do serve my thirst.
Seems to clear my head, when I'm awake at night.
I pull myself so tight, lying in the dark.
Feeling rich with words,
I'm about to draw my thoughts, re planning out my chords.
I'll start it all from scratch.

Take me away, shattered my hopes today.
Nothing kept me on my seat.
Oh it ends so tragically for me.

Take me away....

Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marching in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready, are you ready?

I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance that whole defense
Spinning infinity, but the wheel is spinning me
It's never ending, never ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender

What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays

What if I say that I'll never surrender

In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well

We are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary

I failed in so many plans
Wanted to be sure
I care and I want some more
Little things in life
And some pleasures that I was denied
I feel satisfied
That I left all my past behind

Take it to your top and now watch me get in
Feel the sun is up and now let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
feel me get in
(oh man)
feel me get in
(oh yeah)

Take me up and out
Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had more time for, you...

The three-dimensional professional projections of spectral light
Connected room, selection air-tight
The isolated, the decisive, victory stimulated
The non-simulated patterns of flight originated
Now I'm a carnivore on a tour of duty
My band of brothers in full metal jackets establish cruelty
Black magic conjurer, attack through the monitor
Destruction of assumption, one thing I can promise ya

Impact, crash, with cold shards of glass
Ritualistic annihilators -- murder your cast
The future from the past, that last that feel
The seventh seal broken in half, ceremony is real

Become obsolete, high-strung from a beat
A strong minded individual delivering defeat
Blood rivers in the street, keep flowing no retreat
Deep omens keep opponents speech limited repeat

You're opening the door to the corridor stretching to the left
There's hunger in my eyes, but the truth is on my chest
I am just a man who wants revenge, and I confess
I am full of rage and sin
Locked inside this cage again
When evil reigns 'cause people like to win
It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end
So we shine brightly from the light within

You're opening the doors to the corridors stretching to the left
Anger within my eyes, but the truth is on my chest
I am just a man who wants revenge and I confess

It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end
So we shine brightly from the light within

Locked inside this cage again
Locked inside this cage again
Locked inside this cage again
Locked inside this cage again

Turn the music up a bit...

Yo, yo...
Dark secrets, demons with a conscience
I'm the Lone Ranger looking for Pocahontas
Teenage zombies flying the beat
I'm dying to learn what I'm trying to be
Go Bad News Bears and the Dukes of Hazzard
The youth of my group is the truth, so have it
Keep myself couped up, recoup quickly
Face still hurts but my kids stick with me
Death loved not far as we go
Crazy face, still not star of the show
I appreciate the chance truth hurts, I'll kill you
Ice pick into your neck, I will do (Anything)
Talk to you like I might care (Anything)
Rippled by the nightmare, moonshine distillery
Back road to villiany
Military star, I depart with artillery

Can you say to my face that I'm not wasting all my time

Can you see the way I'm happy and the story that is ending
And my final place to be, with some quiet endlessly
Can you show me one more time

Why can't I see what's in front of me?
Why can't I see what's in front of me?

I see the doors that I can't open
Adding locks from time to time
When it opens something blocks me
And I'm asking myself why?
Did I take the step I wanted
Was it just a state of mind?
I feel sorry for myself
Every time I close my eyes

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...

Why can't I see what's in front of me?
Why can't I see what's in front of me?

What's behind the door I wonder?
Must be brighter than my past
Will I feel a little different
When I take myself across?
Was it really worth the journey?
Was it just a foolish task?
I feel sorry for myself
When I open up my eyes...

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more....

Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burns with no regret
I vow to play the part

In this a meeting of the soul
My feelings are unknown
I learn with no regret
I'm getting what I get

Feel some pain though I'm miles away
And ring to let you know
Are you seeing someone?
I'd better let you go

She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn

Honesty eludes one and all
Like some gypsy's search for gold
He's dreaming all the time
But the gold is hard to find

Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burns with no regret
I'm getting what I get

Made a mistake with myself
My lover couldn't lie
She told me of the things
That made her cry inside

She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn

Having the dreams of some gypsy

Well you know just what you do to me
The way you move soft and slippery
Cut the night just like a razor
Rarely talk and that's the danger

It's the one thing
You are my thing

You know your voice is a love song
It's a cat call from the past
There's no ice in your lovers walk
You don't look twice 'cause you move so fast

It's the one thing
You are my thing

You've got a dozen men behind you
You've got dead flowers on the floor
You're too pretty in the daylight
It keeps them coming back for more

It's the one thing
You are my thing

It's the one thing
You are my thing

It's the one thing
You are my thing

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

Who do you ask when there's no one
Left to turn to
You ask me and I'll always try to hear
Past money and colors and make believe
Good cheap values for a thrifty clown

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

What do you fear in the simple
Still of a summer's night?
I understand I sympathize for a day dream
Fairytailes and I love you

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words
To this, real life documentary

Durch die Straßen die ich geh,
Weht ein kalter rauer Wind
Graue Fassaden, graue Seeln',
Es scheint als sei ich farbenblind.

Leuchtreklamen in Grautönen,
Erzähl mir was vom schönen Leben
Gestelltes Glück, gestellte Szenen
Die mich noch mehr runter ziehen.

Die Straßenschluchten wirken tief,
Ein lebensfeindliches Gebiet,
Bin umhüllt von grauem Nebel
Der sich einfach nicht verzieht.

Ich weiß noch nicht wie
Ich diesem scheiß hier entflieh,
Doch ich spürs tief in mir drin:
Ich werde meinen Weg finden!

(Refrain)
Je vais continuer
Je vais continuer

Auch wenn ich manchmal kein' Ausweg seh!

Je vais continuer
Je vais continuer

Werde ich trotzdem weitergehn!

Il y a des moments ou j'ai
Plus de force pour continuer
Je marche avec la tête baissé
Rien ne peut plus m'encourager
Les images à la télé
Prouvent que l' humain est teubé
Mon seul veux est de m'en aller
De me casser ?
Cette négativité
Est en train de me étouffer
Il faut un claque pour me reveiller
Des pôtes qui sont à mes côtés
Pour me consoler
Pour me motiver
Pour m'encourager
Me dire ça va continuer

(Refrain)
Je vais continuer
Je vais continuer

Auch wenn ich manchmal kein' Ausweg seh!

Je vais continuer
Je vais continuer

Werde ich trotzdem weitergehn! (...gehn! - je vais continuer!)

Es scheint nichts mehr zu gehn,
Es scheint nichts mehr zu gehn.
Es scheint alles zu stehn',
Es scheint alles zu stehn' (ohh!)

Es fühlt sich taub an als wär ich gelähmt
Ich mach tausend Schritte, bleib trotzdem stehn,
Die Welt dreht sich weiter, ich steh allein, doch vom Zweifel zerfressen und Ängsten gequält doch:

Ich lass mein' Kopf nicht häng',
Ich versuch an bessere Zeiten zu denken,
Denn ich hab nur das eine Leben und deshalb geb' ich nicht auf ich werd' weiter gehn'!

(Refrain)
Je vais continuer
Je vais continuer

Auch wenn ich manchmal kein' Ausweg seh!

Je vais continuer
Je vais continuer

Werde ich trotzdem weitergehn!

Je vais continuer
Je vais continuer

Auch wenn ich manchmal kein' Ausweg seh:
Werde ich trotzdem weitergehn!

La bourse des valeurs te dicte ta valeur
À travers les taux d'intérêt ton argent il bosse pour toi
Au fond de ton cœur tu sent le malheur
Que tu cause chaque jour en multipliant tout ce que t'as
T'es toujours pressé et prêt à blesser
Pour gagner dans cette course, faut culbuter les gens
Y a aucune pitié et plus d'humanité
L'égoïsme règne - il n'y a que le business qui vend

Le crie du fric nous fera pas tomber
On l'a défrichi et on comprend ce jeux
Le prix du fric on ne va pas l payer

Il veut une Merco Benz et une nouvelle BMW
Il veux le forcer
Pour pouvoir tout acheter
Il est même près a vendre sa mère pour multiplier
Il est blindé, il n'a jamais assez
On peut pas l rassasier il devient
D plus en plus taré
Pour lui l'amitié
Est que pour profiter
Avec les dégâts collatéraux qu'ils seront la - obligé

Il veut rouler une belle caisse à 200 000
De toutes ces pièces à ses proches
Et ses pots il ne leur dirai jamais -
Tien cousin moi j te le paie ça
Il est en train d perdre la tête à cause de
Toute ces compètes
La solitude serra le prix qui paiera.
Quand il continu, personne lui restera

Hey - du suchst mich sicher schon seit Stunden
Ich schon seit Jahren, hab mich selber nie gefunden
War viel zu sehr an Erwartungen gebunden
Ich musste raus - den Scherbenhaufen überwinden
Und bitte frag mich nicht, wann ich wiederkomm
Ich springe hintern Horizont
Der Neuanfang beginnt für mich mit diesem Song
Glücksbringer sind die Scherben
Die mich darin belehren
Was ich will - Grüße aus der Ferne

Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Ich werde nie mehr sein, was ich soll,
Sondern werden wie ich bin
Ich wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Vis ta vie! - Nicht morgen, sondern jetzt
Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Ich werde nie mehr sein, was ich soll,
Sondern werden wie ich bin
Ich wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Denn das Leben ist nicht morgen, sondern jetzt

Regardons nos vies - On est tous robotisé
Le quotidien pour nous ça devient une odyssée
On se parle plus - Tout le monde est occupé
On a le temps mais on est pas capable d'en profiter
Je m'observe moi-même et ça me fait cogiter
Pourquoi la bousculade est elle en train d' me dominer
Si c'est l'esprit du temps, désolé: Il faut l' quitter
Et vivre sa vie à sa manière sans se presser - obligé!

Manchmal muss man wählen
Und was Neues riskieren, wenn man auf der Stelle steht
Bleiben oder gehen
Doch Entscheidungen kann man dir nicht abnehmen

Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Ich werde nie mehr sein, was ich soll,
Sondern werden wie ich bin
Ich wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Vis ta vie! - Nicht morgen, sondern jetzt
Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Ich werde nie mehr sein, was ich soll,
Sondern werden wie ich bin
Ich wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Denn das Leben ist nicht morgen, sondern jetzt

Nicht morgen sondern jetzt
Ich drück Reset
Nicht morgen sondern jetzt
Ich drück Reset
Ich drück Reset
Nicht morgen sondern
Nicht morgen sondern
Jetzt

Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Ich werde nie mehr sein, was ich soll,
Sondern werden wie ich bin
Ich wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Vis ta vie! - Nicht morgen, sondern jetzt
Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Lass uns nie mehr sein, was wir sollen,
Sondern werden wie wir sind
Wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Vis ta vie! - Nicht morgen, sondern jetzt
Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Lass uns nie mehr sein, was wir sollen,
Sondern werden wie wir sind
Wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Denn dein Leben ist nicht morgen, sondern jetzt
Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Freiheit, und zwar jetzt
Wag den Ausbruch, drück Reset
Denn dein Leben ist nicht morgen, sondern jetzt!

Les gens ils ont la rage car on les pousse
Dans l'esclavage moderne
Tout le monde cherche l'avantage
Concurrentiel pour s'en tirer
On l'accepte pas donc écrivons une
Nouvelle page de l'histoire
Mise en garde! Les gars, ce soir ça va péter
On se laisse plus abaisser, on se laisse plus dresser
L'un contre l'autre - ça devient chan-mé
Et on est prêt à encaisser, on tien bon, on va rester!
Les piliers du système ils vont trembler

Gaz lacrymo, coup d'matraques et armé
Jusqu'au dents - en face de nous les condés
Canon à eau, mais la masse va rester - quoi qu'ils
Essaient, rien ne peut nous stopper!

Stopper!

Kapuzen überm Kopf und das Blut ist am Kochen
Wir stehen noch immer hier mit viel Wut in den Knochen
Drückst den Knopf,
Das Wasser bläst mir meine Zähne raus
Bei dem ganzen Gas hier gehen uns bald die Tränen aus
On va construire des barricades -
On est nombreux, pas marginal
On est efficace, on a pas les frousses, on reste radical
Coup de matraques et tirs de balles en caoutchouc -
Bien qu' ça fasse mal
On ne recule pas; On reste en face -
Affrontement total!
Ihr kriegt uns hier nicht weg
Sind genug um zu fighten
Gewalt ist euer Mittel, wer versucht,
Zu begreifen, ist geschockt
Zu sehen, dass sozialer Aufschrei
Mit Knüppeln begraben wird - Was 'n fuckin Scheiß
Ils ont la chiasse et la preuve elle se trouve
Juste devant nous
Les flics en uniforme pour protéger
Ces malades au pouvoir
On fait le coup d'etat - Il y a aucune alternative,
Car y en a marre, on a la rage,
On a les boules mais de l'espoir

Gaz lacrymo, coup d'matraques et armé
Jusqu'au dents - en face de nous les condés
Canon à eau, mais la masse va rester - quoi qu'ils
Essaient, rien ne peut nous stopper!

Stopper!
Stopper!

Une ligne de CRS devant nous pour nous stopper
Et même si ils nous blessent,
On reste tous pour nous voguer
Car le canon à eau commence à tirer fort
On reste tous ici à la vie à la mort
On recule pas - même si leur tirs de flash bals
Nous font mal
On la ferme pas - et on va toujours rester radical!
Leurs coups de matraques claquent,
Mais jamais on craquera
CRS ou bac - on résiste, on plaque pas!

Gaz lacrymo, coup d'matraques et armé
Jusqu'au dents - en face de nous les condés
Canon à eau, mais la masse va rester - quoi qu'ils
Essaient, rien ne peut nous stopper!

Stopper!

Ich sehe Nazipropaganda, sie schwirrt überall im Netz sie fühlt sich wohl
Im Bundestag im neuen Einreisegesetz. Am Stammtisch wo man über die scheinbare
Ausländerflut hetzt, fühlt sie sich zu Hause, in den Köpfen sitzt sie fest.
Ohne Verstand, mit Waffen und die Zähne voll gewetzt, werden unzählige Menschen bis
Zu ihrem Tod gehetzt. Es wird auf Rasse, Führer und das Vaterland gesetzt.
Zu viele Menschenleben hat diese Ideologie zerfetzt!
Ich frag mich, warum so viele Leute weg schaun,
Ist es Angst, Akzeptanz oder Ignoranz?
Ich wag es, denn je mehr Leute sich traun' ,
Sich querzustellen desto stärker ist der Widerstand.

In die Mitte der Gesellschaft wollen sie ihren Müll verbreiten,
Mit "Thor Steinar" gehn sie weg vom Glatze-Bomberjacken-Style.
An Schulhöfen CD's verteilen, in Stadien Schlägereien.
Liedermacher, Rechtsrock für jeden was dabei. Dumpfe rechte Sprüche
Finden sich in vielen Parteien wieder,
Es brennen Häuser und Idioten schreien "Sieg Heil".
Manche sind schockiert doch wenige Leute greifen ein.
Ich werde nicht ruhen, ich will den Globus nazifrei.

Le fascisme est dangereux
Chaque jour il y a des gens qui se font tuer.
Le fascisme est vicieux
Encore imprégné dans trop de cervaux abimés.

Quant au racisme et la xénophobie,
Ma tolérance s' arrête ici!
Pas d'comprehension pour ces imbéciles!
Je n' attend plus, je passe à l'offensive.
Mon attaque est puissante et dynamique.
Je me défend, s'il le faut avec des front-kicks.
C'est ma façon de courage civique
J'reste radical, je reste antifasciste!

Stoppt jetzt - den eiskalten kontest!
Tödliche kunkurrenz - auf jedem kontinent.
Komplex, verstrickt und vernetzt
Ist der kampf um die macht im weltweiten kontext.
Wir wenden das blatt, jeder tut was er kann!
Gemeinsam nehmen wir jetzt das ruder in die hand.
Wir halten zusamm' die hoffnung stirbt zuletzt'.
Unsre antwort steht fest: globaler protest!

Ref.:

Aufstehn! wir setzen alles in bewegung.
Also auf geht's! nichts hält uns auf, on s' arrête pas!
Ey lasst uns aufstehn für eine weltweite bewegung
Also auf geht's! mouvement mondial, seid ihr dabei?

Dans tous les coins du monde entier on reste actif.
On a besoin de beaucoup de mains pour créer des alternatives.
Le chemin est loin, même si c'est dur on reste vif,
Chaqu' un à sa facon de lutter - notre mouvement est créatif!

Ce monde est complexe et interconnecté.
Il y a plein de liens au profit du marché
Global - en même temps des régions oubliées,
Complétement exploitées, dépendantes, affamées.
Donc on va s' unir et organiser mondialement pour s' opposer et pour créer un mouvement assez puissant pour faire trembler et faire bouger les appuis des systèmes basés sur l' ingéalité

Ref.:

Aufstehn! wir setzen alles in bewegung.
Auf geht's! nichts hält uns auf, on s' arrête pas!
Ey lasst uns aufstehn für eine weltweite bewegung
Also auf geht's! mouvement mondial, seid ihr dabei?

Keiner hält uns auf weil wir zusammen stehn.
Wir werden laut, wenn wir auf die straße gehen
Für solidarität.
Wir hörn nicht auf, unsren traum zu leben.
Wir geben nicht auf, wir ballen die faust - um uns aufzulehnen.

Stopp jetzt! wir durchbrechen den kontest!
Kontern gemeinsam mit konsens als konzept.
Komtrast - même s' ils nous opressent - die bewegung bleibt ein kollektiver prozess,
Der im kleinen anfängt, sich im großen fortsetzt.
Jeder trägt dazu bei, projekt für projekt.
Dieses lied ist für euch! die hoffnung stirbt zuletzt.
Unsre antwort steht fest: globaler protest.

Etes-vous prêts à dépasser les murs?
A raisonner le silence et à éclaircir l'obscur.
À créer un endroit où on ne trouve plus de clôture.
Essayez d'profiter du moment, même si c'est dur!
Donc décontractez vous et lancez vous dans l'aventure!
Dansez, fêtez, sautez, faites tout ce qui vous fait plaisir.
Dites ce que vous pensez, mais vous n'avez jamais osé dire-
Ça va exploser, on a la joie et le sourire.
Tu sais que le moment est venu de sortir de ta vie quotidienne.
Elle te freine.
Plein de peur, tu n'as pas le choix.
Et si le même déroulement de chaque journée te suffi, prépare toi!
Car se soir et le moment ou tout changera.

BOUM - prépare toi pour cette explosion ce soir on va tout lâcher,
Cette soirée va tout casser
BOUM - prépare toi pour cette explosion et pour une fois oublie tes soucis!

Je vais vivre ma vie, la journée et la nuit.
Les angoisses et les craintes, je les laisse derrière moi, car elle me freinent trop.
Je vais vivre ma vie, la journée et la nuit -
Un instant du courant attrapé pour de vrais et le sentir si chaud.
Je n'veux plus de soucis -
NON
Mais je veux de la joie
OUAIS!
Pour une seule fois j'aimerais me sentir libre comme un oiseau,
Je n'veux plus de soucis-
NON
Maisje veux de la joie
OUAIS
Et il me faut plus de mots.
Tu sais que le moment est venue de sortir de ta vie quotidienne.

Prépare to!

Ref.:

On est là, les rebelles sont là - pour une nouvelle définition
Du reggae et du ragga
Haut les bras, les rebelles sont là. nous restons critiques dans
Tout les domaines.

J'aime bien reggae music - crois-moi qu'j'aime bien le dancehall
Ce que j'aime pas, c'est les paroles d'homophobie et les paroles
De "hot gal"
Les sounds que je kiffe sont conscious et foutent à l'hopital
Tous les bad-boys, tous les bad-man, tous les imbéciles avec leurs balles
Nos paroles sont dures, nos paroles sont antinational
Notre relation avec l'état n'est pas bonne, n'est pas amical
Il nous traite de voyous, il nous traite d'une bande amical
C'est mon choix d'être rebelle, c'est mon choix d'être radical.

Ref.: ...

Je reste rebelle - contre les abus sexuels
Je défends les homosexuel(le)s
Je sais que la vie peut être belle
C'est un appel à la morale, c'est un appel des rebelles
J'observe une situation, regardez-moi ce gars-là
Il n'arrête pas de draguer cette fille, puis elle le recale
Il commence à la bousculer,et j'espère que dans ce cas là
Tous les gens vont venir avec nous pour lui faire du mal.

Ref.: ...

Ca parle de rastafari et puis ca parle de selassie
Du roi des rois, du sauveur de l'Afrique et de l'éthiopie.
Heureusement, il était là pour combattre et lutter contre l'italie
Mais n'oublions pas le massacre qu'il a fait en érythrée
Je pense qu'il faut faire gaffe avec les gens qu'on glorifie
Je tolère tout sauf l'intolérance, j'accepte ton avis
Mais c'est dommage que beaucoup de chanteurs et beaucoup de mc
Semblent ne pas avoir de propre opinion, ils sont seulement des copies.

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

Dying swans, twisted wings
Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life
In this garden of fear
I have seen many things
In a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more
Bring this savage back home

Wilderness house of pain
Makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain
Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real
Those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls
To this brave new world

A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world

In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world

Dragon kings, dying queens
Where is salvation now
Lost my life, lost my dreams
Rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here
Dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned
In this brand new world

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way have I dreamt this time this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face seen this room been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't take no more

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

I get up put on the light dreading the on coming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away myself from drifting saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning lost a nightmare I retrace

Lost a hell that I revisit lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Ohh oo oo ohh
Ohh oo oo ohh
Ohh oo oo ohh

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

I have sailed to many lands now I make my final journey
On the bow i stand, west is where i go
Through the night i plough still my heart calculate and pray
As the compass swings my will is strong
I will not be led astray

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know
I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know
I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Withered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live

Out of the silent planet, dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise, no more second chances
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late
Before you know the crime it's all too late

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation

Demons are inside you and they are making a play
Watching and their hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready to take over your mind

You and only God will know what can be done
You and only God will know I am the only one
You and only God will know what can be done
You and only God will know I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all of my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and he's coming my way
It's an honor to be chosen and i wait for the day

Could it be it's the end of our world

Nothing left but to face this all of my own

Diablo comes again
To make trophies out of men

Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright

Toe to toe throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will Iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
you're the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend your own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some they say that you have killed a hundred man
Others say that you have died and live again

No man's ever understood your genius

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost
At what price a life is lost

At what point do we begin
Fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a gray place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame
On society these days
But what kind of good or bad
A new generation brings

Sometimes take just more than that
To survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

Just a few small tears between
Someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between
Being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn
Of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road
And the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a gray place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue was frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a new born in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

The ferryman wants his money you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a new born in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again

Your time will come

Thank God we ended war
We're at peace and fight no more
Everyone is helping getting back
When I turn on my TV
Not a single catastrophe
The future's looking bright
We are right on track

We're singing oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

We're dancing in the sun
And everybody's happy
Welcome to a world where no one cares who's number one
Where you don't feel no pain
And nobody is screaming
Everyone has time and no one's ever on the run
We're dancing in the sun

Remember those hungry kids?
Now they got Mars and Twix
Another good old misery has passed
You love suits and they love you
It's like a dream come true
Black and white side by side at last

We're singing oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

We're dancing in the sun
And everybody's happy
Welcome to a world where no one cares who's number one
Where you don't feel no pain
And nobody is screaming

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
And You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops

Don't let the hurdle fall
So be the girl you loved

I'll wait
So show me while you're strong
Ignore everybody else
We're alone now

I'll wait
So show me while you're strong
Ignore everybody else

Suddenly, I'm hit
It's the starkness of the dawn
And your friends are gone
And your friends won't come
So show me where you fit
So show me where you fit

I'll wait
So show me why you're strong
Ignore everybody else

What's the reasons for that..
Let go of the burden that keeps you
looking back at the tracks that you made as you fell.
What's the reasons for that
if we will never try to stand again.

Two summers passed but the winters didn't.
You moved but you keep coming back.
This place kept us both down and you knew that.
But you,
you took the first breath
as we reached the surface.
You took the first breath.

Two summers passed but the winters didn't.
They remained within us like monuments of the words we never said.
But you,
you took the first breath
as we reached the surface.
You took the first breath.
And i,
i told you my secrets.
There will be no more cold.
You took the first breath,
now will you let go.

You tried to find home and it's in your hands now.
You tried and it's far from what slipped through,
slipped through ours.
Wasn't this what you asked for.
You tried to find home and it's in your hands now.

So shouldn't you
let go of the burden that keeps you looking back at the tracks
that you made as you fell.
What's the reasons for that
if we will never try to stand again.

Two summers passed but the winters didn't.
You moved but you keep coming back.

I tried to see you
Through broken glass
Prepare to warn you
Nothing will last

I don't want you
You make me crazy
Cannot have you
You make me crazy

Trust in something
To be let down
I've gathered my fears
Just as I hit the ground

I don't want you
You make me crazy
Cannot have you
You make me crazy

Oh!

So much pain inside
My head begins to explode
I'm lost without reason
Grown cold

You're lost forever
Etched in my mind
Streams of pressure
Leave me so unkind

I don't want you
You make me crazy
Cannot have you
You make me crazy

Oh!

So much pain inside
My head begins to explode
I'm lost without reason
Grown cold

You've taken all that's good in me
Now I've taken back, but you sit in hell

You threw me with your cue face down
Come around like nothing have happened

Jump
It's all the same

Back down
It's all the same

Back down

Original text by  Jerkstore
Okay, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga…"
Again, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
Never had shit, never take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga
Give me everything…"

Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with, haven't came up
And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinking that they fucking with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
"Oh, my God, don't be mean to me"
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in the way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s

Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
Never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…"

Uhh, let's go

Yeah… yeah, yeah, what, um
Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan something
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful
Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful

And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying, "Come and see"
And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There will be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

'Til Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast the golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked and behold, a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him

I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
I started to keep going
But something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in
And I give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been it's been awhile
She was glad to see me
I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said it's not to late to start again
We could spend a night together
Take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot

Then I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes I'm in need of something
But it's something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said good-bye
She just left me standing in there, I never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot

Well, go on down to Jackson; go ahead and wreck your health.
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself,
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair!

Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson.

See if I care.

"Goodbye," that's all she wrote.

But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg.
They'll lead you 'round town like a scalded hound,
With your tail tucked between your legs,
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man.
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Jaypan Fan.

Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,

I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear
You are someone else, I am still right here

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down,  I will make you hurt

If I could start again, a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way

Nico KIZ, aka der Blonde aus dem Mustopf
Kriegt nach der letzten Stunde schön Bomben auf'm Schulhof
20 Leute stehen lachend hinter dir da, ich war 5 Jahre 'n Opfer
Du bist es die 50 danach
Zum Glück hab ich für so 'n Scheiß nie genug Ehre gehabt
Hab gehört du ziehst immer noch 17-Jährige ab
Egal, ich häng mit meinen Jungs (Gib mir mal die Belton Kanne)
Zum ersten Mal ohne Quietscheentchen in der Wanne
Ich wollt' doch nur sprühen, warum schreien die, die stechen uns ab
Und jagen uns hinterher, über 3 U-Bahnstationen
Hätte mein Sportlehrer damals auch 'n Messer gehabt
Hätte ich sicher auch ne Ehrenurkunde geholt
Dann musst' ich unbedingt doch noch mit krassen Leuten hängen, rumbangen
Danach lernte ich zum Glück echte Freunde kennen
Seitdem nie mehr mit Vollidioten auch nicht mit den Bullen mit
Hoff' ich seh euch nie wieder, wie das Geld das ihr mir schuldet

Du bist gerade im Club, auf Nase, mit den Mädels
Und ich ritze diesen Text in deinen AMG Mercedes
Wir stehen vor deiner Villa und du hörst uns schreien
Wir sind das letzte, doch werden die ersten sein

Ich bin nicht mehr in die Schule vertieft
14 und ich interessier' mich nur für Musik
Bis das Studio im Jugendclub schließt
Mein bester Freund ist ein Jugo, ein Freak
Der nachts von einer Heimat träumt, in der die Munition fliegt
Und tags Touris abzieht
Doch mit Älteren abzuhängen war ein super Gefühl
Jeder hat in seiner Jugend gedealt
Mein Vater hat den Stoff gefunden, das Klo runtergespült
Bin ich bei Einbrüchen Schmiere gestanden
Hab ich von der Beute nie was bekommen, Mitläufer
Normal, dass wir auf Partys ungebetene Gäste sind
Der Gastgeber greift ein, weil wir sein Mädchen belästigen
Die Stimmung kippt, ich seh tatenlos zu
Der Gastgeber bricht zusammen, Atemnot, Blut
In der Wanne haben wir alle erstmal Bomben gekriegt
Und die anderen schoben alles auf mich. (Was?)

Du bist gerade im Club, auf Nase, mit den Mädels
Und ich ritze diesen Text in deinen AMG Mercedes (Oh, das wird teuer)
Wir stehen vor deiner Villa und du hörst uns schreien (Stürmt den Palast!)
Wir sind das letzte, doch werden die ersten sein

ADS, Nervensäge seit der ersten Klasse
Ich fing an mit Rap, weil ich kein Fernsehen hatte
Trotz der Brille hatt' ich kein Verstand
Und kam wirklich alleine zu dem Einzelkampf
Und die kamen zu viert, zum Kottbusser Tor
Aber keiner machte mir in Sachen botten was vor
Stolz auf die Eins in Sport und die Fünf in Mathe
Damals war Rap auf Deutsch für euch nur Kinderkacke
Fick die Bonzenclique und die Straßengang
Lauf' lieber ins Verderben als euch nachzurennen
Leider gab's noch keine Amokläufer als wir Kinder waren
Denn seit Winnenden haben sie Angst vor Brillenschlangen
Nicht dazu zu gehören hat immer seinen Preis
Doch das Blut auf meinem Shirt war niemals nur meins
Du bist im VIP, wir hängen draußen ab
Und tanzen zu diesem Song auf deinem Autodach

Du bist gerade im Club, auf Nase, mit den Mädels
Und ich ritze diesen Text in deinen AMG Mercedes
Wir stehen vor deiner Villa und du hörst uns schreien
Wir sind das letzte, doch werden die ersten sein

Du bist gerade im Club, auf Nase, mit den Mädels

He comes with us... ? ...oh my God, oh my God, this guy is so awesome I can't believe it. Do you see that?" - "Yeah, that's so Berlin. Are we going to Berghain this weekend?" - "We should!" - We really should. We didn't get in last time... Let me just make fuckin'..."

Ariane, erstes Mal Berlin, 15 Jahre
Abgeschnittene Hotpants, blond gefärbte Haare
Bestellt sich einen Wodka, will dass ich ihn bezahle
Da kommst du aber auch mit auf Toilette, ziehst Nase
Ich küss dich auf den Mund du drehst dich weg
Guck mal links und rechts, hier hat jeder Sex
Zeig mal da unten dein Leberfleck
Ich fass dir an die F-F-F nach Schema F
Du drückst meine Hand weg, sagst du magst mich sehr gerne
Ich leg dir noch 'ne Line, du ziehst und sagst du siehst Sterne
So wie du dich anziehst bist du doch 'ne perverse
Schlampe, die will das ich sie unterwerfe
Ich drücke dich runter, du bläst meinen Schwanz
Wirst ohnmächtig mit meinem Gerät in der Hand
Ich spritz ab, gehe weg, du lehnst an der Wand und schläfst
Ich tanz mit der nächsten Madame

Und am Montag geht es wieder ins Büro
Sie haben recht, ich Idiot, natürlich Chef
Das mach ich gern in meiner Mittagspause
Das haben sie morgen auf dem Tisch
Da fehlt nur noch der letzte Schliff
Bevor das nicht fertig ist, gehe ich nicht nach Hause

Michaela, 52 Jahre, damals schon im E-Werk, immer mit 'ner Fahne
Knallt heimlich Meth, ich sag, dass ich sie verrate
Wenn sie nicht mitkommt und tut was ich sage
Du fickst jetzt mit Peter, los zieh dich schon aus
(Nein man, ich will nicht, der sieht widerlich aus!)
Peter auf Speed, holt 2 cm raus, erstmal das Geld
Seh ich wie Mutter Teresa aus?
Ab geht die Post, dem Geld folgen Taten
3 Viagra und er hat einen Harten
Er hält sich nicht zurück, das gibt ein paar Narben
Nach 20 Minuten hört sie auf zu atmen
Peter rastet aus, ist seit 6 Tagen drauf
"Wir müssen uns stellen, da komm 'wa jetzt 'nimmer raus"
Ich stech ihm durchs Fett mit meinem Messer in den Bauch
Er verreckt, ich hau ab, direkt Kater Blau

Und am Montag geht es wieder ins Büro
Sie haben recht, ich Idiot, natürlich Chef
Das mach ich gern in meiner Mittagspause
Das haben sie morgen auf dem Tisch
Da fehlt nur noch der letzte Schliff
Bevor das nicht fertig ist, gehe ich nicht nach Hause

Ich weiß nicht seinen Namen, ca. 30 Jahre
Gangsterrapstar, den kenn ich aus dem Fernsehen
Mal sehen ob die so hart sind wie die Zeitungen sagen
Ich gehe raus, warte in der Seitenstraße
Er kommt um die Ecke hat mein Messer am Hals
Du weißt dass das in deiner Kehle steckt wenn du beißt?
Das was gleich passiert hältst du besser geheim
Ich denk nicht dass du das deinem Schutzgelderpresser mitteilst
Er öffnet seine Lippen, fängt an zu blasen
Nebenbei erklär ich ihm wo ich ihn gleich vergrabe
Tränen in den Augen, Rotze in der Nase
Hoffnungslose Lage, sein Kopf ändert die Farbe
Ich komme, bin abgelenkt, passe nicht auf
Er nimmt mir das Messer weg, ab in mein Bauch
Okay du hast gewonnen, ich gehe gleich drauf
Doch du wirst immer an mich denken
Wenn dir deine Kleine einen kaut

Und am Montag geht es wieder ins Büro
Sie haben recht, ich Idiot, natürlich Chef
Das mach ich gern in meiner Mittagspause
Das haben sie morgen auf dem Tisch
Da fehlt nur noch der letzte Schliff
Bevor das nicht fertig ist, gehe ich nicht nach Hause

Ey, Kevin!
Wat denn jetzt schon wieder?
Ick such die Ariane!
Ja, weiß ick doch nicht man...
Du, ick hab dir gesagt, du sollst auf die uffpassen!
Ja, aber das ist doch jetzt dem ? sein ?

Tut mir leid wenn ich den Untertanenstolz jetzt verletze
Doch was quatscht ihr da, es gibt nicht genug Ausbeutungsplätze
Ihr wollt Kapitalismus mit Herz?
Fick mich, aber nicht im Etap Hotel
Sondern richtig schön mit Essen gehen
Und am nächsten Morgen noch Taxigeld
Vor der Glotze, sauer auf die scheiß Sozialschmarotzer
Anstatt auf den Chef, der mit dem Geld aus eurer Arbeit
Seiner Tochter noch 'nen Lamborghini kauft
Alter, dann verdient ihr's auch
Doch ich versteh, ihr regt euch lieber über Brangelina auf
Für's Gewissen 10 Euro spenden
Dann kommen die hoffentlich nicht über die Grenzen
Und holen sich alles zurück, vielleicht lieber doch die Waffenlieferung canceln?
Fleißig wie ihr seid habt ihr doch die Sterbeurkunde schon vom Amt geholt
Der Knopf leuchtet in ampelrot, Tarek sag ihnen, was haben wir im Angebot!

Soll ich dich *stich*?
Willst du, dass *piu piu*?
Wie wär's mit *ratata*?
Oder lieber *boom*?
Ich hab ein' roten Knopf
Mit einem Totenkopf
Wenn ich ihn drücke, dann geht alles hoch am Block

Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Meine Vorfahren ham Wildschweine gejagt
Jetzt leb' ich mit Barbaren, die tun was die Bildzeitung ihn' sagt
Ihr Partypatrioten
Seid nur weniger konsequent als diese Hakenkreuz-Idioten
Die geh'n halt noch selber ein paar Ausländer töten
Anstatt jemand' zu bezahl'n, um sie vom Schlauchboot zu treten
Die Welt zu Gast bei Freunden und so
Du und dein Boss ham nix gemeinsam bis auf das Deutschlandtrikot
Ich hab noch nie so treue Sklaven gesehen
Die bereit sind für mehr Arbeit auf die Straße zu gehen
Und Promis treten für die Truppen in Afghanistan auf
Wo sind bloß die Terroristen, wenn man sie grade mal braucht?

Soll ich dich *stich*?
Willst du, dass *piu piu*?
Wie wär's mit *ratata*?
Oder lieber *boom*?
Ich hab ein' roten Knopf
Mit einem Totenkopf
Wenn ich ihn drücke, dann geht alles hoch am Block

Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um
Boom, boom, boom,boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Der Lynchmob ist krank vor Neid
Auf das 5-Sterne-Hotel im Asylantenheim
Der Lynchmob hat keinen Cent im Portemonnaie
Egal ob Merkel nun ein' Minirock oder Kopftuch trägt
Ihr könnt im Wahllokal ankreuzen, wer den Puff besitzt
Es bleiben immer die gleichen Freier, denen ihr ein' lutschen müsst
Denkt ihr die Flüchtlinge sind in Partyboote gestiegen?
Mit dem großen Traum im Park mit Drogen zu dealen?
Keine Nazis - ihr seid brave Deutsche
Die sich nicht infizieren lassen mit der Affenseuche
K.I.Z. Selbstmordattentäter
Ich sprenge eure Demo und es regnet Hackepeter

Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Ich bring euch alle um
Bring euch alle um, bring euch alle um

Der Babysitter hat abgesagt
Scheißegal heut geh ich steil
Mische meinem Kind 'ne Schlaftablette in den Babybrei
Der "Endlich wieder Single"-Post hat 20.000 Facebook-Likes
Sie sagt, dass sie mich betrogen hat?
Egal ich führe 10 zu 1
Opa leidet Höllenqualen, Opa wird an Krebs verrecken
Ich bin im Kit Kat und verchecke seine Schmerztabletten
Pupillenteller, meine Kiefer die mahlen
Denn ich hacke meine Komplexe mit meiner Kreditkarte klein
Ein Raver liegt zuckend am Boden
Ich filme seinen Todeskampf
Er bittet mich Hilfe zu holen
Ich sage "Ihgitt, fass mich bloß nicht an!"
Ich wollte zum Gottesdienst
Dachte er wird mir vergeben
Doch ich gehe in Flammen auf, als ich die Kirche betrete

Ich ruf die Partyzombies mit dem Telefon
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Gib mir Vodka, gib mir Koks
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos), Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos)
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos), Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos)
Ich spuck' dich an und hoffe du schlägst mich tot

Ich lass meinen Lakaien für mich einen Geldschein verbrennen
Champagner für alle, die es sich leisten können
Das Problem ist nicht, dass ich ein Alkoholiker bin
Das Problem ist dass ich hier nichts zum saufen bekomm
Ich hau der Barfrau auf die Schnauze und alle drehen sich um
Was denn? Auf meinem Planeten ist sowas nur Sachbeschädigung!
Ich will nicht umsonst für meine Bodyguards zahlen
Und mach 'nen Affen, wie die Eltern von Oliver Kahn
Ich hab den Speed-Pimmel und du die Hängetitten
Wer von uns beiden ist hier grad am Resteficken?
Ich ruf mein Baby an, "Guten Morgen, na wie gehts?"
Spoilerwarnung: Ich habe AIDS

Ich ruf die Partyzombies mit dem Telefon
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Gib mir Vodka, gib mir Koks
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos), Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos)
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos), Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos)
Ich spuck' dich an und hoffe du schlägst mich tot

Was das hier für 'ne Party? Noch keiner was gelegt?
Zehn Vodka Bull für Papi - Zeit, dass sich was dreht
Die Kleine findet mich geil, ihre Freundin flüstert "Mach das nicht"
Zeig mal dein Ausweis, gnade dir Gott, wenn du Schlampe schon über 18 bist
Das ist, wie bei Captain Hook, du musst dir das Kondom nur vorstellen
Sie rennt vor mir weg, ich schaff es gerade noch zum nächsten Club zu torkeln
Gebe den Ehering an der Garderobe ab, frage jeden hier ob er noch Drogen hat
Du machst Party als ob du Geburtstag hast, ich mach Party als wär ich im Todestrakt
Wenn heut nix mehr geht, wird noch ne billige Nutte bei Tinder herbestellt
Vor meinem Schlafzimmer die gleiche Messlatte wie vor 'nem Kinderkarusell
Du hast Ehre bist der, der bei sich die Flüchtlinge aufnimmt
Ich bin der, der im Berghain die Pissrinne austrinkt
Ich finger 'ne Olle beim Tanzen und check' erst danach
Dass sie meine Schwester ist
Naja auch egal, hab' ja früher auch schon mal bei dir ins Bett gepisst
Sie ist auch drauf, wir fahren nach Haus'
Zwei Banger wollen unsere Taschen sehen
Nehmt die Kohle und die Schlampe
Aber lasst mich gehen

Ich ruf die Partyzombies mit dem Telefon
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Gib mir Vodka, gib mir Koks
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos), Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos)
Heute Abend wird ehrenlos
Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos), Ehrenlos (Ehrenlos)
Ich guck dich an und hoffe du schlägst mich tot

Album  Hurra die Welt geht unter
Seitdem du fort bist, befind ich mich im freien Fall
Jeden Morgen verkatert, meine Wohnung ein Schweinestall
Du hast ein Herz in mein Treppenhaus gesprüht
Es wurde gestern überstrichen
Als will mir irgendjemand sagen, vergiss das Mädchen
Doch ich möchte dich vermissen
Die Fingernägel einer fremden Frau
Bohren sich durch meine Haut ins Fleisch
Die Kratzspuren auf meinem Rücken sehen aus
So als hätte sie mich ausgepeitscht
Manchmal hab ich einen One Night Stand
Als Gegengift für mein Selbstmitleid
Ruf dich mit unterdrückter Nummer an
Doch ich weiß, das du weißt, wer ins Handy schweigt

Von 44 bis 361 waren wir das schönste Paar weit und breit
Und du denkst ich schlaf alleine ein?
Doch meine treue Begleitung ist meine Einsamkeit
Hab mich mit Drogen und mit Alk betäubt
Suche mit irgendwelchen Leuten Streit
Und du denkst ich schlaf alleine ein?
Doch meine treue Begleitung ist meine Einsamkeit

Seitdem du fort bist, befind ich mich im freien Fall
Bin nur auf Partys, rede mir ein du wärst scheiß egal
Sie nennen mich Bruder zu Begrüßung, wenn ich weg bin ein' Spasten
Dabei hab ich all meinen falschen Freunden immer Gästelistenplätzchen gebacken
Wieso denke ich das weißes Pulver die Einsamkeit verjagt? (Einsamkeit)
Sie mag mich nicht wenn ich kokse
Ich kokse weil sie mich nicht mag
Ich seh dich auf der Tanzfläche, du wirkst super entspannt
Du lächelst und hälst mein pochendes Herz in der blutigen Hand

Von 44 bis 361, waren wir das schönste Paar weit und breit
Und du denkst ich schlaf alleine ein?
Doch meine treue Begleitung ist meine Einsamkeit
Hab mich mit Drogen und mit Alk betäubt
Suche mit irgendwelchen Leuten Streit
Und du denkst ich schlaf alleine ein?
Doch meine treue Begleitung ist meine Einsamkeit

Seitdem du fort bist, befind ich mich im freien Fall
Ich werde schnell leben, jung sterben und deine hübsche Leiche sein
Es tut mir Leid, ich lies dich alleine in deiner Verzweiflung
Ich war auf der Bühne und du hattest den Termin für die Abtreibung
Die Leute lügen wenn sie sagen "Zeit heilt alle Wunden"
Denn es ist vorbei, seit 5732 Stunden
Und jetzt liegt ein anderer Mann neben dir und küsst dich wach
Vielleicht kann ich ihn irgendwann dafür lieben, dass er dich glücklich macht

Von 44 bis 361 waren wir das schönste Paar weit und breit
Und du denkst ich schlaf alleine ein?
Doch meine treue Begleitung ist meine Einsamkeit
Hab mich mit Drogen und mit Alk betäubt
Suche mit irgendwelchen Leuten Streit
Und du denkst ich schlaf alleine ein?
Doch meine treue Begleitung ist meine Einsamkeit

Meine Frau ist 20 Jahre jünger (Das ist Geld)
Sieht aus wie 30 Jahre jünger (Das ist Geld)
Ich kaufe ihr ein Fußballteam (Das ist Geld)
Ich sehe was das du nicht siehst und das ist Geld!

Du Wasser und Brot, ich Schampus und Koks
Schmeiß' die Fuffies durch den Club, die Menge trampelt sich tot
Frag mich nicht wer meine Kinder aufzieht
Frag mich nicht wie 'ne U-Bahn von innen aussieht (Das ist Geld)

Bowling-Bahn in der Stretch-Limousine
Du verkaufst für ein' Scheck deine Niere
Keine Schwielen an den Händen (Das ist Geld)
Sagen "Geld ist nicht alles" (Das ist Geld)

Mein achtzigster Vorkoster krümmt sich am Boden
Ein waschechter Pornostar entjungfert mein' Sohn (Das ist Geld)
Für 20 Kinder Unterhalt zahlen
'Nem Penner was geben wollen, aber nur Hunderter haben

Ich schmeiß' das Geld zum Fenster raus
Du stehst da unten, fängst es auf
Davon kaufst du diesen Hit
Und das Geld kommt zu mir zurück

(Geld! Geld!)
Wo sind die Millionäre? (Geld! Geld!)
Und meine Obdachlosen? (Geld! Geld!)
Wie heißt das Zauberwort? (Geld! Geld! Geld! Geld! Geld!)

Die Jungfräulichkeit der Tochter beim Pokern verlieren (Das ist Geld)
Vor 'ner leerstehenden Wohnung erfrieren

Ihr seid gefeuert ihr Schmarotzer
Und ich tanz durch die Fabrik mit den brandneuen Robotern
N' schönen Benz hast du gebaut, guck ihn dir kurz mal an
Dann geb ich Vollgas und fahr neben dir durch den Schlamm

Ich schmeiß' das Geld zum Fenster raus
Du stehst da unten fängst es auf
Davon kaufst du diesen Hit

Wegen bedrucktem Papier (Das ist Geld)
Den Chef wegen der Sache im Parkhaus nicht anzeigen
Der Grund das K.I.Z. bis heute zusammen bleiben

Dass ich Schwuchteln hasse hab ich früher gerne gesagt
Heute nicht mehr, denn sonst platzt der Werbevertrag (Das ist Geld)
Tja, da guckste mein Lieber!
Ja, die gibt's auch in lila

Ich schmeiß' das Geld zum Fenster raus

Album  Hurra die Welt geht unter
In meiner Gegend leben geisteskranke Menschen
Um zu sterben kann es reichen den Falschen anzurempeln
Du wirfst dem Bettler etwas in den Hut
Denkst du das macht die Messerstecherei von gestern wieder gut?
Am Tatort lagen Briefe und Rosen, doch die Blumen hab ich für meine Geliebte gestohlen
Unsere Körper sind dünn, die Wände sind dünner
Wenn sie den Strom abstellen, gibt's ein Candlelight-Dinner
Wenn die Bullen einen Dealer hochnehmen, wird geteilt:
Ein Beamter baut ein' Joint, sein Kollege legt 'ne Line
Heute stürmt die Polizei die falsche Wohnungstüre
Deshalb wird ein Kindergärtner halb totgeprügelt
Als ich am nächsten Morgen durch den Türspion blick
Stirbt schon wieder ein Junkie an 'ner Überdosis
Wenn jemand zu dir sagt: "Du darfst niemandem trauen"
Will er wahrscheinlich grade deine Brieftasche klauen

Alle anderen sind glücklich und satt (Wir bringen den Hass)
Brennende Autos, plündert die Stadt (Wir bringen den Hass)
Pflastersteine treffen dein' Kopf (Wir, wir bringen den Hass)
Abendessen gibt es im Knast (Wir, wir, wir bringen den Hass)

Der Reporter will ein Video von Neandertalern?
Wir schreien "Uga, Uga" und jagen den Kameramann
Mein Onkel brüllt "Warum zündet ihr kein Porsche am Ku'damm an?"
Seit den Krawallen muss er U-Bahn fahren
Du fragst die Lehrerin "Was soll ich von dir lernen du Schlampe?"
Sie hat Angst vor euch und Vodka in der Thermoskanne
Papa wollte mir beibringen dass man Schwächere nicht schlägt
Deshalb sitze ich beim Arzt und meine Fresse wird genäht
Die Nachbarin kriegt von ihrem Typen auf die Schnauze
Als sie weint verläuft die Schminke und man sieht das blaue Auge
Ich seh sie 100 Kilo Lidl-Tüten stemmen
Eigentlich müsste sie ihn verprügeln können
Silvester knallen wir uns den Frust von der Seele
Alle hielten den Schuss für 'ne Rakete
Drei Wochen lang derselbe Song in Dauerschleife
Danach fanden die Bullen seine verfaulte Leiche
Beziehungsweise was der Hund von ihm übrig lies
Wozu ein Abschiedsbrief? Wenn ihn niemand liest

Alle anderen sind glücklich und satt (Wir, wir bringen den Hass)
Brennende Autos, plündert die Stadt (Wir bringen den Hass)
Pflastersteine treffen dein' Kopf (Wir, wir bringen den Hass)
Abendessen gibt es im Knast (Wir, wir, wir bringen den Hass)

Siehst du den Typ da drüben wie er mit den Tränen kämpft?
Seine Frau macht Geld im wackelnden Mercedes Benz
Wenn es regnet steht er klitschnass neben ihr
Auf dem Straßenstrich, hält für sie den Regenschirm
Siehst du den Penner vor'm Getränkemarkt?
Auf dem Plakat in seinen Händen steht "Das Ende naht"
Im Treppenhaus steht der Sensemann
Grüßt mich mit Ghettofaust und sagt ich bin als nächstes dran
Und ein Stockwerk tiefer beißt ein Pitbullkiefer
In das Bein von einem schreienden Gerichtsvollzieher
Der eine Täter hat kein Job, er hat keine Papiere
Den Job von Täter Nummer 2 macht jetzt eine Maschine
Der Tankwart tut so als würde ihm das ganze Geld gehören
Also stirbt er für den Shell-Konzern
Für acht Euro die Stunde, nen Fuffie Kasseninhalt
Und nen Boss der ihm nicht mal seinen Grabstein bezahlt

Alle anderen sind glücklich und satt (Wir, wir bringen den Hass)
Brennende Autos, plündert die Stadt (Wir bringen den Hass)
Pflastersteine treffen dein' Kopf (Wir, wir bringen den Hass)
Abendessen gibt es im Knast (Wir, wir, wir bringen den Hass)

(Wir bringen den Hass
Wir bringen den Hass
Wir, wir bringen den Hass
Wir, wir bringen den Hass
Wir bringen den Hass
Wir, wir bringen den Hass
Wir, wir, wir bringen den Hass
Wir, wir bringen den Hass
Wir, wir, wir bringen den Hass)

Kleidung ist gegen Gott, wir tragen Feigenblatt
Schwingen an Lianen über'n Heinrichplatz
Und die Alten erzählen vom Häuserkampf
Beim Barbecue in den Ruinen der Deutschen Bank
Vogelnester in einer löchrigen Leuchtreklame
Wir wärmen uns auf an einer brennenden Deutschlandfahne
Und wenn einer auf der Parkbank schläft
Dann nur weil sich ein Mädchen an seinen Arm anlehnt
Drei Stunden Arbeit am Tag, weil es mehr nicht braucht
Heut' Nacht denken wir uns Namen für Sterne aus
Danken dieser Bombe vor 10 Jahren
Und machen Liebe bis die Sonne es sehen kann
Weißt du noch als wir in die Tische ritzten in den Schulen
"Bitte Herr vergib ihnen nicht, denn sie wissen was sie tun"
Unter den Pflastersteinen wartet der Sandstrand
Wenn nicht mit Rap, dann mit der Pumpgun

Henning May:
Und wir singen im Atomschutzbunker:
"Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!
Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!
Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!"

Und wir singen im Atomschutzbunker:
"Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!
"Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!
Auf den Trümmern das Paradies

Nimm dir Pfeil und Bogen, wir erlegen einen Leckerbissen
Es gibt kein' Knast mehr, wir grillen auf den Gefängnisgittern
Verbrannte McDonald's zeugen von unsern Heldentaten
Seit wir Nestlé von den Feldern jagten
Schmecken Äpfel so wie Äpfel und Tomaten nach Tomaten
Und wir kochen unser Essen in den Helmen der Soldaten
Du willst einen rauchen? Dann geh dir was pflücken im Garten
Doch unser heutiges Leben lässt sich auch nüchtern ertragen
Komm wir fahren in den moosbedeckten
Hallen im Reichstag ein Bürostuhlwettrennen
Unsere Haustüren müssen keine Schlösser mehr haben
Geld wurde zu Konfetti und wir haben besser geschlafen
Ein Goldbarren ist für uns das gleiche wie ein Ziegelstein
Der Kamin geht aus, wirf' mal noch 'ne Bibel rein
Die Kids gruseln sich, denn ich erzähle vom Papst
Dieses Leben ist so schön, wer braucht ein Leben danach?
(Wer braucht ein Leben danach, wer braucht ein Leben danach?)

Auf den Trümmern das Paradies

Die Kühe weiden hinter uns, wir rauchen Ott spielen Tavla
Dort wo früher der Potsdamer Platz war
Wenn ich aufwache streich ich dir noch einmal durch's Haar
"Schatz ich geh zur Arbeit, bin gleich wieder da"
Wir stehen auf wann wir wollen, fahren weg wenn wir wollen
Sehen aus wie wir wollen, haben Sex wie wir wollen
Und nicht wie die Kirche oder Pornos es uns erzählen
Baby, die Zeit mit dir war so wunderschön
Ja, jetzt ist es wieder aus, aber unsere Kinder wein' nicht
Denn wir ziehen sie alle miteinander auf
Erinnerst du dich noch als sie das große Feuer löschen wollten?
Dieses Gefühl, als in den Flammen unsere Pässe schmolzen?
Sie dachten echt ihre Scheiße hält ewig
Ich zeig' den Kleinen Monopoly, doch sie verstehn's nicht
"Ein Hundert-Euro-Schein? Was soll das sein?
Wieso soll ich dir was wegnehm' wenn wir alles teilen?"

Ich wuchs auf in kuscheliger Wärme
Meine Nachbarn waren Mutters Gedärme
Sie wusste, dass da draußen die Hölle ist
Trotzdem presste sie mich in das grelle Licht (Hure!)
Ich verließ ihre Lende, direkt in des Doktors gierige Hände
Vermummte Menschen um mich herum
Papa lächelt, ich bin seine Rentenversicherung
Bild dir nichts darauf ein, dass du Vater bist
Du bist nur irgendein Idiot der mein' Arsch abwischt
Wehe ich erbe eure Glubschaugen
Ich werde Mama das Leben aus der Brust saugen
Was habt ihr euch bei meinem Namen nur gedacht? (Verräter!)
Ihr habt meine Nabelschnur gekappt
Und mich fallen gelassen in eine kalte Welt
Die Papa selbst doch auch nur mit Alk aushält

Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama

Omas Knochenfinger stochern in meinem Babyspeck
Ausgestellt wie ein Zootier im Käfigbett
Sie wissen dass ich ausbrechen werde
Und tragen mich, damit ich das laufen nicht lerne
Meine Babysitter waren Jediritter
Robocop und Dr. Spock
Ich habe keine Angst, denn die Plastiksoldatenarmee
Steht am Bett und bewacht mich beim Schlafen
Doch die Großen mochten meine Bodyguards nicht
Und haben alle in der Mülltonne erstickt
Und dann sagten sie, es gäbe keinen Weihnachtsmann
Aber ließen mir die Monster im Kleiderschrank, ich hör sie flüstern
Papa lass das Licht an und die Tür zu meinem Zimmer einen Spalt auf
Denn in euren Gute-Nacht Geschichten
Setzen Eltern ihre Kinder im Wald aus

Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama

Ihr sollt mich morgens nicht in den Kindergarten bringen
Ich will so lange schlafen, bis ich erwachsen bin
Ich werde nie die anderen Kinder verstehen
Die Sandburgen zertreten und Insekten quälen
Kleine Teufel, die für ein paar Gummibären so tun
Als ob wir allerbeste Kumpels wären
Die Erzieher machen einen auf interessiert
Doch meinen Kuchen aus Sand haben die nicht mal probiert
Die Sterne die im Schlafzimmer hängen sind Attrappen
Ich zieh mir an den Haaren, um schneller zu wachsen
Endlich groß sein und dicke Muskeln haben
Ich hab kein Asthma, ich will nur eure Luft nicht atmen
Jahr für Jahr werd' ich größer
Und bis zur Türklinke sind es nur noch ein paar Zentimeter
Ich hab meine Eltern satt
Und schwimme bis zum Horizont durch das Bällebad

Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama
Ich hab zwei Kugeln in der Kammer
Eine für Papa und eine für Mama

Mit Sprengstoffgürtel im Nobelrestaurant
Wenn der Ober jetzt nicht kommt, wird hier alles weggebombt
Wir wollen Hummer, Kaviar und Kobe-Rind umsonst
Wir wollen den besten Tisch neben Wowereit bekommen
Das hier ist eine Geiselnahme
Die Medien und das SEK sind eingeladen
Ich und meine Freundin feiern heute Jahrestag
Und heut Abend liegen wir Hand in Hand im Leichenwagen
Ich stell den Bullen meine Forderungen
Wir haben hier den Bürgermeister mit paar Senatoren
Entweder brüllst du meinen Heiratsantrag in das Megaphon
Oder ich bring alle fünf Minuten irgendjemand um
Und als die Scharfschützen mit den Gewehren auf uns zielen
Formen Laserpointer ein Herz auf uns'rer Stirn
Sie schwört, in der Hölle vermähl ich mich mit dir
Und die Kugeln durchquer'n unser Gehirn

Mädchen mach den Schampus auf
Ich hab doch gesagt, ich bring dich ganz groß raus
Wir sind Superstars über Nacht
Unsre Poster in der ganzen Stadt

Mein Mädchen hat ein Zeittor okay?!
Und ja, sie kennt die Pläne der Cyborg Armee
Sie hat versucht euch zu warnen
Doch durch die Gummizellenwand konntet ihr Idioten kein Wort verstehen
Die Ärzte haben gesagt, sie ist wahnsinnig
Und dass sie ihre Freunde wären, aber waren sie nicht
Haben sie gefoltert zu viert, betäubt und fixiert
Sie hat sich die Todesliste in den Arm geritzt
Der Arzt liegt zitternd da, sabbert wie ein Spast
Die Spritze in seinem Arm war für sie gedacht
Ich habe seinen Schlüssel, trage seinen Kittel
Und wir fahren im Krankenwagen in die rabenschwarze Nacht
Drück das Gaspedal mein Schatz, ich knall ein paar von ihnen ab
Und im Rückspiegel sehen wir die Festung brennen
Irgendwann werden sie uns töten und es Selbstmord nennen
Doch bis dahin knallen wir die Sektkorken

Mädchen mach den Schampus auf
Ich hab doch gesagt, ich bring dich ganz groß raus
Wir sind Superstars über Nacht
Unsre Poster in der ganzen Stadt

Du hast all dein Mut zusammen genommen
Und jetzt sind wir hier
Du singst vor und alle anderem am Set applaudieren
Außer er - "Okay gesungen, nicht so gut gedanced
Guck dich an, dich würd ich nicht mal anpissen wenn du brennst"
Du rennst heulend raus, ich hinterher
Der einzige, der heut noch vor ne Jury tritt, das ist er
Abends gibts ne Bombe als er in sein Cabrio steigen will
Wir kommen jetzt mit zu dir, gib's in dein Navi ein, sei still
Wir drehen dein Song auf den Boxen laut und keiner hört sein
Geschrei aus'm Kofferraum
Denn jetzt hat er die Tränen in den Augen, Pisse in der Jeans
Los mach den Safe leer oder ich das Magazin
Zurück zur Karre auf die Autobahn
Baby, deine Lippen fühlen sich unglaublich an
Und er sitzt da wie Stephen Hawking
Am Stuhl fest gegurtet und hört Modern Talking im Loop, bis er verdurstet

Mädchen mach den Schampus auf
Ich hab doch gesagt, ich bring dich ganz groß raus
Wir sind Superstars über Nacht
Unsre Poster in der ganzen Stadt

"Ich werd' dich glücklicher machen, als du es jemals warst"

Ich verfolge dich Mädchen
Ruf dich ständig an und spiele Callcenter-Agent
Bis du mir verrätst in welchem Haus du lebst
Ich hab laut gestöhnt, danach hast du aufgelegt
Meine Ex, sie sagt ich wär 'n Freak
Ich durchsuch dein Müll und finde raus welches Parfum du liebst
Du hast 'ne Wahnsinnsfurcht, rennst zum Karatekurs
Du rennst nachts panisch den Park hindurch, Baby warte kurz
All die Briefe mit Gefühlen für dich, hast du mir rot korrigiert mit 6- zurück
In die Klinik geschickt, trotz all der Pillen und elektrischen Schocks
Blieb mir der Duft deiner Wäsche im Kopf und seitdem mir meine Flucht gelang
Versteckst du dich im Zeugenschutzprogramm
Splitternackt liegst du da, deine Nippel sind hart
Denn es ist Valentinstag und du witterst Gefahr
Ich bin im Schrank

Das ist Tarek KIZ, ihm gibt niemand einen Korb (Niemand einen Korb)

Wär es besser jemand würde dich beschützen
Ich hab eine Knarre gekauft und pass heute Nacht auf dich auf
Neuerdings hast du ja Platz auf der Couch
Da dein Freund seit Wochen nicht zu erreichen ist, der scheißt auf dich
Du hast echt was besseres verdient, zum Beispiel mich
Ich bin doch dein Schmusebär und du meine Diddl Maus
Ich mach alles was du willst für dich und was du nicht willst auch
Du bist mir was schuldig und du weißt ich kann kein "Nein" ertragen
Und wenn ich dich nicht bekomme, soll dich keiner haben
Ich glaube die ersten Blumen zu denen du nicht sagst "Nein, Danke"
Werden die sein, die ich auf deinem Grabstein pflanze

Du erzählst deinen Freundinnen, du hast dich in mir so getäuscht
Jeden Tag verlink ich dich auf unseren alten Fotos neu
Du kannst zurzeit nicht wirklich schlafen, stehst noch einmal auf
Guckst aus dem Fenster und mein Wagen steht vor deinem Haus
Die Bullen anzurufen kannst du dir sparen
Denn die halten dich für verrückt nach den letzten 20 mal
Du brauchst 'ne Auszeit von deinem Mann, ich versteh's
Doch ich komm auf der Party an... und du gehst?
Ich halt dich fest am Handgelenk
Du weißt nicht was du an mir hast
Dein Neuer steht daneben rum und sagt nichts, dieser Spast
Wegen so einem verlass ich dich nicht
"Bringt er dich auch so zum Lachen, wie ich?"
"Nein, aber vor allem nicht so zum Weinen"
Das ist vorbei, ich hab mir helfen lassen
Seit dem Selbstmordversuch
Guck hier, ich hoffe dir gefällt mein Tattoo
Es ist dein Name Schatz
Weißt du noch, als du gefragt hast ob ich dich für immer liebe?
Da hab ich ja gesagt

Das ist Nico KIZ, ihm gibt niemand einen Korb (Niemand einen Korb)
Ihm gibt niemand einen Korb
Wenn du sagst du liebst ihn nicht, machst du dir etwas vor (Dir etwas vor)
Dann machst du dir etwas vor
Er ist verrückt, verrückt nach dir
Er ist verrückt, verrückt nach dir
Er ist verrückt, verrückt nach dir
Das ist Nico KIZ, er ist verrückt nach dir

Album  Hurra die Welt geht unter
Papa will dich waschen
Dabei warst du gerade erst baden
Es ist doch ganz normal an einem Samstagabend
Zeit mit den Liebsten zu verbringen
Keinohrhasen DVD, Papa hat dich doch nur lieb
Später wirst du das verstehen
Eine Hand auf dem Knie, eine Eins in Physik
Lass dich doch mal drücken, das ist mein Handy was du spürst
Ich bin so stolz auf dich mein Kind, du bist schon so groß
Nur noch ein bis zwei Jahre
Kein schlechtes Gewissen unser kleines Geheimnis
Ich wollt' dich doch nur kitzeln
Diese Tränen schmecken salzig
Mama würde dir nicht glauben, es gehören immer zwei dazu
Du fragst bei jedem Schritt im Flur
Was würde Manny Marc tun?

Wenn ich nix mehr errege, außer dein Mitleid
Und meine Spermienanzahl nicht mehr für ein Kind reicht
Dann klappt das doch, aber es ist geistig behindert
Und du weißt es wird dein Kind bleiben für immer (für immer, immer?)
Und niemals Rechtsanwalt oder ein Fußballstar
Vielleicht bestenfalls, alleine U-Bahn fahren
Und dann irgendwann wenn wir Falten kriegen
Sagst du im Streit zu mir "Hätt' ich doch abgetrieben"
Ich schlaf wieder mal auf der Couch ein
Und hör dich im Schlafzimmer auch weinen
Du willst 'ne Auszeit, denn kein Paradies kann so schön sein
Dass es diesen Müll hier ausgleicht
Du hörst die glücklichen Menschen dich in Gedanken ausbuhen
Und du fragst dich: Was würde Manny Marc tun?

Ich nehm dich mit in die Rummelbums-Disko
Lasst uns treffen
Null Problemo, alles vergessen
Rummelbums-Disko, lasst uns treffen
Null Problemo, alles vergessen

Rummel Rummel, Bums Bums, Disko Disko, null Problemo
Rummel Rummel, Bums Bums, Disko Disko, null Problemo

Ich muss Papa waschen, dabei ist er doch schon 50
Mama hat uns längst verlassen, er sitzt da betrinkt sich
Früher war er der, der mir Fahrradfahren beigebracht hat
Heute der, der nicht merkt, dass er sich gerade eingekackt hat
Ich muss es wegmachen, ihn ins Bett schaffen, guck ihn traurig an, er schreit
"Das hab ich früher für dich auch getan!"
Ich steh wieder an der Spüle, kipp den Jägermeister aus
Ich muss weinen, er auch
Doch plötzlich ändert sich sein Blick, er rastet einfach aus
"Wer sind Sie? Was tun sie hier in meinem Haus?"
Am nächsten Morgen sagt er wieder die Vergangenheit tut ihm leid
Er umarmt mich, Junge du bist alles was mir bleibt
Wenn du mich auch verlässt, knot ich ein Seil und steige dann auf einen Stuhl
Und ich frage mich: Was würde Manny Marc tun?

Papa verlor ich im Krieg, Mama und Schwesterherz ans Meer
Ihre durstigen Schreie wollte der Schlepper nicht mehr hören
Ich sei der nächste, würde ich nicht aufhören zu heulen
Seitdem weine ich nicht mehr, doch sehe ihn in meinen Träumen
Teil mein Bett mit drei Fremden, weiß nicht genau wo ich bin
Hier gibt es keine Soldaten und trotzdem muss man uns beschützen
Wie soll ich eure Sprache lernen, was ich höre sind jeden Tag die selben Worte:
"Verpisst euch wo ihr herkommt!"
Vielleicht geht's morgen zurück, sagen sie jeden Tag
Und mir scheint ihnen wärs lieber es wär heut schon soweit
Macheten oder Gesetze, eins von beiden bringt mich um
Und ich frage mich: Was würde Manny Marc tun?

Ich nehm dich mit in die Rummelbums-Disko
Lasst uns treffen
Null Problemo, alles vergessen
Rummelbums-Disko, lasst uns treffen
Null Problemo, alles vergessen

Rummel Rummel, Bums Bums, Disko Disko, null Problemo
Rummel Rummel, Bums Bums, Disko Disko, null Problemo

Nico K.I.Z. - gern geschehen
Ich hab' die Saurier sterben sehen
Fans wollen ein Bild von mir machen
Aber sie dürfen sich kein Bild von mir machen
Da staunt ihr was? Ziemlich krasse Punchline
Macht euch'n schönen Tag und lasst mich'n guten Mann sein
Es liegt an eurem geistigen Fassungsvermögen
Wenn ihr bei K.I.Z. nicht lacht, ihr Amöben
Unendliche Weisheit und Körper aus Stahl
Abertausende verlassen erleuchtet den Saal
Ich bin kein Großkotz
Ich bin bloß Gott

(Wir) haben niemals unseren Arsch verkauft
(Wir) haben Pyramiden auf dem Mars gebaut
(Ja wir) reisen von hier in die Unendlichkeit
(Denn wir) wir bestehen nicht aus Menschenfleisch

(Ihr seid alles, wir sind nichts
Nehmt uns auf das Raumschiff mit
Ihr seid alles, wir sind nichts
Nehmt uns auf das Raumschiff mit)

Ihr Untermenschen, verbeugt euch nun vor
Den Erfindern von deutschem Humor
Auf einmal findet jeder hier schwul sein okay
Aber Homosexualität war uns're Idee
Ihr unterfordert mein Riesenhirn
Ihr schreibt Geschichte, wir diktieren
Die BPjM versucht unser Schaffen zu verbieten
Doch wir haben schon über euch gewacht, da hattet ihr noch Kiemen
Verdammt, wieder mal das Grillfleisch vergessen
Für das Bilderberg-Treffen
Kein Plan warum ihr Christen, Moslems und Juden noch Streit habt
Allah, Jehova, Gott - Jungs duzt mich doch einfach!

(Wir) haben niemals unseren Arsch verkauft
(Wir) haben Pyramiden auf dem Mars gebaut
(Ja wir) reisen von hier in die Unendlichkeit
(Denn wir) wir bestehen nicht aus Menschenfleisch

Tarek Ebéné, der nubische Prinz
Die Wahrheit steht nicht in euren Schulbüchern drin
Kleopatra zum Beispiel war höchstens 'ne Vier
Ich hab Züge gesprüht, da habt ihr noch in Höhlen geschmiert
Ich bin von eurer Sterblichkeit angeekelt
Und versteh' kein Wort, wenn ihr alle durcheinander betet
Hab' Originalaufnahmen vom Holocaust
Denn ich hatte meine GoPro auf
Moses und ich haben Lines auf den Steintafeln gezogen
"Wo bleibt der Dritte Weltkrieg? Wollt ihr, dass ich einschlafe hier oben?"
Seht, was wir erschaffen haben - ihr müsst uns einfach lieben
Die Orsons, Trailerpark, 257

(Wir) haben niemals unseren Arsch verkauft
(Wir) haben Pyramiden auf dem Mars gebaut
(Ja wir) reisen von hier in die Unendlichkeit
(Denn wir) wir bestehen nicht aus Menschenfleisch

Sie haben niemals ihren Arsch verkauft
Sie haben Pyramiden auf dem Mars gebaut
Sie reisen von hier in die Unendlichkeit
Denn sie bestehen nicht aus Menschenfleisch

(Wir) haben niemals unseren Arsch verkauft
(Wir) haben Pyramiden auf dem Mars gebaut
(Ja wir) reisen von hier in die Unendlichkeit
(Denn wir) wir bestehen nicht aus Menschenfleisch

Album  Hurra die Welt geht unter
Kleidung ist gegen Gott, wir tragen Feigenblatt
Schwingen an Lianen über'n Heinrichplatz
Und die Alten erzählen vom Häuserkampf
Beim Barbecue in den Ruinen der Deutschen Bank
Vogelnester in einer löchrigen Leuchtreklame
Wir wärmen uns auf an einer brennenden Deutschlandfahne
Und wenn einer auf der Parkbank schläft
Dann nur weil sich ein Mädchen an seinen Arm anlehnt
Drei Stunden Arbeit am Tag, weil es mehr nicht braucht
Heut' Nacht denken wir uns Namen für Sterne aus
Danken dieser Bombe vor 10 Jahren
Und machen Liebe bis die Sonne es sehen kann
Weißt du noch als wir in die Tische ritzten in den Schulen
"Bitte Herr vergib ihnen nicht, denn sie wissen was sie tun"
Unter den Pflastersteinen wartet der Sandstrand
Wenn nicht mit Rap, dann mit der Pumpgun

Henning May:
Und wir singen im Atomschutzbunker:
"Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!
Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!

Und wir singen im Atomschutzbunker:
"Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!
"Hurra, diese Welt geht unter!
Auf den Trümmern das Paradies

Nimm dir Pfeil und Bogen, wir erlegen einen Leckerbissen
Es gibt kein' Knast mehr, wir grillen auf den Gefängnisgittern
Verbrannte McDonald's zeugen von unsern Heldentaten
Seit wir Nestlé von den Feldern jagten
Schmecken Äpfel so wie Äpfel und Tomaten nach Tomaten
Und wir kochen unser Essen in den Helmen der Soldaten
Du willst einen rauchen? Dann geh dir was pflücken im Garten
Doch unser heutiges Leben lässt sich auch nüchtern ertragen
Komm wir fahren in den moosbedeckten
Hallen im Reichstag ein Bürostuhlwettrennen
Unsere Haustüren müssen keine Schlösser mehr haben
Geld wurde zu Konfetti und wir haben besser geschlafen
Ein Goldbarren ist für uns das gleiche wie ein Ziegelstein
Der Kamin geht aus, wirf' mal noch 'ne Bibel rein
Die Kids gruseln sich, denn ich erzähle vom Papst
Dieses Leben ist so schön, wer braucht ein Leben danach?
(Wer braucht ein Leben danach, wer braucht ein Leben danach?)

Henning May:

Und wir singen im Atomschutzbunker:

Auf den Trümmern das Paradies

Die Kühe weiden hinter uns, wir rauchen Ott spielen Tavla
Dort wo früher der Potsdamer Platz war
Wenn ich aufwache streich ich dir noch einmal durch's Haar
"Schatz ich geh zur Arbeit, bin gleich wieder da"
Wir stehen auf wann wir wollen, fahren weg wenn wir wollen
Sehen aus wie wir wollen, haben Sex wie wir wollen
Und nicht wie die Kirche oder Pornos es uns erzählen
Baby, die Zeit mit dir war so wunderschön
Ja, jetzt ist es wieder aus, aber unsere Kinder wein' nicht
Denn wir ziehen sie alle miteinander auf
Erinnerst du dich noch als sie das große Feuer löschen wollten?
Dieses Gefühl, als in den Flammen unsere Pässe schmolzen?
Sie dachten echt ihre Scheiße hält ewig
Ich zeig' den Kleinen Monopoly, doch sie verstehn's nicht
"Ein Hundert-Euro-Schein? Was soll das sein?
Wieso soll ich dir was wegnehm' wenn wir alles teilen?"

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his

You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money

She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money (money...money)
If you ain't no punk
Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!)

Yeah, it's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave your ass she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries

So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this nine is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

"All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours"

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches (Okay, okay)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga it's go time

I roll in dough with a good grind and I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet, they say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it"

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most till someone said to me

"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it"

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank

Pass out, drank, wake up, drank

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Hop out, do you bang?

Where is she taking me?
Where is she taking me?

All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
(That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't trippin')
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in 's lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
(And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too)
Wait hold up, ay I see somebody

Aha, got them niggas, K-dot, you good?

The world gets smaller
My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller
You might be bigger, but I'm much smarter
My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller

What don't kill you lets you live
To remember what it did
I'm a bit relieved you're still the same
'Cause there's no illusion you've changed

Now it's all over
I see now, I'm a veteran of things I don't want to be

And the more I learn, the less I know
And the deeper it feels, the less it shows
There was a time and a day when
I didn't think I would be here

But now, it's all over
I see now, I'm a veteran of things I don't want to be
I've been down, and it's over

Ladies and gentlemen: Welcome to The Love Show...Ooh

Ich weiß nicht, ob das Liebe ist
Wenn du mir meine beine brichst
Wenn du mir meine Chips wegisst
Weiß ich nicht, ob das Liebe ist

Aber ich steh' auf dich dafür
Was treibst du eigentlich mit mir?
Du bist gemein, du bist nicht fair
Ich geb' dir alles und noch mehr

Lieb mich oder hass mich
Wenn du mich schlägst, find' ich das fantastisch
Ich seh' das nicht so drastisch
Denn ich lieb' dich und du hasst mich

Mega lieb...mich oder hass mich
Wenn du mich schlägst, find' ich das fantastisch
Ich seh' das nicht so drastisch
Denn ich lieb' dich und du hasst mich

Du erzählst Gerüchte, die nicht stimmen
Sagst, ich könnte gar nicht schwimmen
Tust mir weh
Das trifft mich schwer
Mach' so weiter Baby gib mir mehr!

Und du bist ganz genau mein Typ
Weil du mich den ganzen Tag belügst
Ich setze dich auf meine Thron
Dass du mich ausnutzt ist der Lohn

Du glaubst es ist vorbei
Vielleicht aber auch nicht - Vielleicht nicht Ahhhha
Du hast die Qual der Wahl
Enscheid' dich, Kopf oder Zahl

Lieb mich oder hass mich...

Schlag zu oder ich verlass dich...

Denn ich lieb' dich und du hasst mich

I woke up this morning
With a bad hangover
And my penis was missing again
This happens all the time, it's detachable

(Detachable penis)

This comes in handy a lot of the time
I can leave it home
get me in trouble
Or I can rent it out when I don't need it

But now and then I go to a party,
Get drunk, and the next morning
I can't, for the life of me,
Remember what I did with it

First I looked around my apartment
And I couldn't find it
So I called up where the party was
They hadn't seen it either
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet
'Cause, for some reason I leave it there sometimes
But, not this time
So I told them if it pops up to let me know

I called a few people who were at the party
But they were of no help either
I was starting to get desperate
I really don't like being without my penis for too long
Make me feel like less of a man
And, I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak

After a few hours searching the house,
Calling everyone I could think of,
I was starting to get very depressed, so
I went to the kia and ate breakfast

Then as I walked down the 2nd Avenue
Towards St. Marks place
Where all those people sell XXX
And other junk on the street

I saw my penis lying on a blanket
Next to a broken toaster oven
Some guy was selling it
I had to buy it off him
He wanted 22 bucks
But I talked him down to 17
I took it home, washed it off
And put it back on
I was happy again, complete

People sometimes tell me
I should get it permanently attached,
But, I dunno...
Even if sometimes it's a pain in the ass
I like having a detachable penis

(Detachable penis)

Stranded in the spooky town
Stoplights are swaying and the phone lines are down
The floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eye
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
The skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

Now it's coming closer
Now it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded, all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now, baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing, taking its toll

Isolation
When you leave it's like I disappear
Desolation
Every time you go it feels like
Seconds slowly turn to minutes
A month of Sundays coming up
Time again it pulls me under
Wonder if I'll ever rise above
It's too much but not enough

Misery loves company
For a little bit of sympathy

It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today

Desperation
Sinking into somewhere dark and cold
Deviation
A place I knew I didn't wanna go
To forget is all I know

Misery loves company
For a little bit of sympathy

It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today

Minutes slowly turn to hours
Another moment passes by
Seconds of eternity
I wonder if it's time to say goodbye

It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again
It's here today but it's gone tomorrow
It's here today and today will never come again

Giant tropical centipedes share their territories with tarantulas.

Despite its impressive length, it's a nimble navigator, and some can be highly venomous.

As quick as lightning, just like the tarantula it's killing, the centipede has two curved hollow fangs which inject paralyzing venom.

Even tarantulas aren't immune from an ambush.

This centipede is a predator.

Das große Leben eines großen Mannes
braucht als Basis einen großen Traum,
den er träumt in einem großen Bett,
und so ein Bett gehört in einen großen Raum.
Große Räume gibt es nur in großen Häusern,
mit großen Fenstern, um hinaus zu schau'n
auf das eigene, entsprechend große Land,
das umgeben ist von einem großen Zaun.

Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört.
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt.
Ich bin der Diener von dem, was ich verdiene,
ich bin der Sklave von dem, was ich versklavt.
Und allen Dingen über die ich verfüge,
füge ich mich brav.

Ich hab's geschafft, wonach ich immer strebte.
Alle Dinge ringsumher gehören mir.
Doch das Einzige was ich dabei empfinde.
Ist die Angst, es wieder zu verlier'n.
Und so verkriech ich mich mit allen meinen Schätzen.
Ins verkabelte gepanzerte Versteck.
Ich bin Müde, doch wag ich nicht zu schlafen
sonst kommt der Pöbel und nimmt mir alles weg.

Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört.
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt.
Was ich beherrsche, das raubt mir die Beherrschung
bin ganz benommen, von dem was ich mir nahm
um meinem Schicksal geschickt zu entkommen - doch es kam

Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört.
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt.
ich bin erdrückt, von all den Unterdrückten
und weil mein Reichtum mir immer noch nicht reicht,
bleibt mir als Sicherheit, doch nur ein wenig Sicherheit - vielleicht.

Wenn ich ehrlich bin, habe ich den Beruf
des Musikers nur gewählt, weil im Fernsehen
Popstars den ganzen Tag von jungen Dingern
umgeben sind, die an ihnen herumfingern.
Wenn sie von der Bühne in die Massen schauen,
sehen sie tausende wunderschöne Frauen
in Ekstase ihre T-Shirts nach oben reißen
und Bikinioberteile auf die Bühne schmeißen.

Also opferte ich meine besten Jahre,
und übte wie ein besessener auf der Gitarre.
Tag für Tag in einem dunklen Proberaum
und das alles nur für meinen Traum!
Doch der ist nicht in Erfüllung gegangen:
Keine Models, keine Teenies, keine Zahnspangen.
Alles was ich seh', auf den Konzerten
sind dicke Männer mit Bärten.

Ich schäme mich für meine Fans
was soll ich tun, die gehen nicht!
Wie machen das die andren Bands?
Ich kann nicht mehr, erlöse mich!
Ich will von High Society
und V.I.P.s umgeben sein.
Stattdessen seh' ich jeden Tag
erbärmliches Proletenpack.

Zugegeben hin und wieder passiert es,
dass ein relativ kultiviertes Individuum
mich mit seiner Anwesenheit überrascht.
In so einem Fall nehm ich mir die Zeit.
Doch will ich mit ihr dann irgendwan raufgeh'n
fällt ihr ein, sie muss um viertel sechs aufsteh'n.
Schon ist sie weg, und ich schenk' mir noch ein Glas ein
Kann ja wohl nicht wahr sein!

Ich schäme mich für meine Fans
was soll ich tun, die gehen nicht!
Wie machen das die andren Bands?
Ich kann nicht mehr, erlöse mich!
Ich will von High Society
und V.I.P.s umgeben sein.

Geschlechtsverkehr!
Geschlechtsverkehr!

Eine wichtige Lebensstation
War meine erste Kopulation.
Ich wohnte in einem Internat,
Da ging es heftig zu, in der Tat.
Ich schlich mich in Carolas Zimmer,
Dort sah ich sie im Kerzenschimmer,
Und nur ein kleines Stückchen Seide
Bedeckte ihre Scheide.

Geschlechtsverkehr!
Geschlechtsverkehr!
Geschlechtsverkehr!
Geschlechtsverkehr!

Und als ich ihr darauf erklärte,
Dass ich sie sexuell begehrte,
Sagte sie: "Ich will dir gestatten,
Mich auf der Stelle zu begatten."
Und so begann ich, wie beschrieben,
Den Penis tief hineinzuschieben
Und kurz darauf bekam ich einen
Orgasmus; sie leider keinen.

Die Tür steht auf,
Ich trete ein
Du lächelst nie,
Doch dein Glück kann ich fühlen.
Und meine Hand,
Fährt durch dein Haar,
Ich lehn mich an dich
Und schließ meine Augen.

Dann leg ich dir,
Die Riemen rum.
Verstehn' uns ohne ein Wort
zu sagen.
Du atmest tief,
Dann geht es los.
Ich halt mich fest und du gehst darin auf,
Mich zu tragen.


Trag mich so weit es geht,
Trag mich egal wo hin.
Solang ich nur bei dir,
Und in Bewegung bin.

Dein Körper glänzt,
Im Abendlicht.
Ich spür' die Kraft,
Hinter jeder Bewegung.
Du Bäumst dich auf,
Ich geb mich hin.
Und unter jedem deiner Schritte erbebt,
Die Umgebung.


Trag mich so weit es geht,
Trag mich egal wo hin.
Solang ich nur bei dir,
Und in Bewegung bin.


Trag mich so weit es geht,

Trag mich so Schnell du kannst.
Trag mich wo hin du willst,

Nur mal angenommen, ich könnte meinen Körper dermaßen
Verbiegen, dass mein Kopf bis in den Anus hinein passen
Würde. Ja dann wär' mein Gedanke der:
Warum nicht auch meine Arme mit hinein um dann weiter
Zu kriechen in meinem Leib empor? Ja ich weiss es geht leider
In Wirklichkeit
Nicht ganz so weit.

Aber lassen wir einmal die biologischen Argumente.
Mich intressiert, wenn ich bis in meinen Kopf kriechen könnte,
Käme ich dann aus
Meinem Mund heraus?
Wo befände sich dieser eigentlich?

Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I'd like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Another means I'll find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That I can never find a way to reach
My inner self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind

Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me

Life's got to always be messing with me
Can't they chill and let me be free?
Can't I take away all this pain?
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feeling like a freak on a leash
Feeling like I have no release
How many times have I felt diseased?
Nothing in my life is free, is free

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Oh, yo, pretty ladies around the world, got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls, tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down, and you'll know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Word up

Everybody say, when you hear they call you, you've got to get it underway
Word up

It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you'll know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker D.J.'s who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason, and we know the reason why
You try to put on those Airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize that you're acting like fools
If there's music we can use it, be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Hey you, hey you, devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs, turn it up, turn it up
The wind is coming through, can't get enough

A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on your breast, your dress
Vibrations coming through, you're in a mess

A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor

Music do, music do

Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt
Says who, says who?  Anesthetize this bitch!
A-nes-the-tize this bitch, anesthetize!
Just let me be, between you and me, don't fit

Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper

The madness creeping up on me,
The pressure's building I foresee,
Alienation's lurking
Spawning lunacy.

Slowly escaping
This wreckage in making
So don't look back for me.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Die another day.
Die another day.

Misery often misleads.
It creates things we cannot see.
Excessive thoughts are bound
Distorting reality.

Slowly escaping
This carnage in making
So don't look back for me.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Die another day.
Die another day.

Hello, are you there?
How come won't you listen?
I really don't care.
I really don't care .

Slowly escaping
This wreckage in making
Nothing will be the same.
So don't look back for me .

Sometimes we take it all.

To die another day.

What's it gonna be today?
Keep chipping at my soul, and why must it disobey?
The only thing I loathe

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today
I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way
It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won
I'm done

Have I been lead astray?
Blaming the righteous, what do you think they'd say?
Attacking the altar

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today
I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way
It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won
I'm done

I'm done

I'm done with faceless feelings
I'm done with anything
I'm done trying to support you and sacrificing everything

Everything, everything

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today
I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way
It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won

Feelings you see are so hard to believe
All the chaos I have in my heart
Devils I make and the love can relate
All the solace inside tears me up

Take me away, set me on fire
There's no other way

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained, I'm so lost and lonely now

Weaving deceit is so easy for me 'cause the loathing I've had from the start
Evil disease all the hatred it breathes as I'm down on my knees torn apart

Take me away, set me on fire
There's no other way

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained, I'm so lost and lonely now

Where do I run? Where do I hide?
Give me a reason to my end my life
Where do I run? Where do I hide?
Give me a reason to get out alive

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained, I'm so lost and lonely now

Seething, I walk the circle I called out long ago
But somehow I get lost each time
Feeding this hunger deep inside that never lives
The voice within eats me up inside

One, I love hurting you
Two, I love your pain
Three, let's get together and play the sinner's game
Four is for the torture and five is for the shame
'Cause every time you want it, I get off on this game

You wanted to play, the coldness follows
This isn't a game, your life, I'll swallow
And I can't help but smile at your pain
You wanted to play, but I already won

Gloating, I plant the seed inside your head right away, watch it grow
Destroying your insides, pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways
I watch the tears fall, I crack a smile

One, I love hurting you
Two, I love your pain
Three, let's get together and play the sinner's game
Four is for the torture and five is for the shame
'Cause every time you want it, I get off on this game

And I can't help but smile at your pain
You wanted to play, but I already won

I look at you and start to crack, start to crack
I give into, you take it back, take it back
This lullaby is all you have, all you have
Sadistic pleasure, I attack, I attack
I attack, I attack, I attack

You wanted to play, the coldness follows
This isn't a game, your life, I'll swallow

You wanted to play, but I already won

Why does life got be this way?

Help me, I am freaking, and my heart is barely beating
And the demons, they are creeping around
Take me, I am sinking, and my lungs are barely breathing as the angels put me into the ground

And everybody's peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

Slap me, I am shaking, and my guts are really aching
And the demons, they're laughing out loud
Spare me, I am fading, and my will is dissipating as the angels put me into the ground.

And everybody's peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

My mind is debating, these lesions I'm making
This mess is sedating, the power embracing
The bullshit I'm facing, my feelings, I'm hating
Reality is failing, this shit is degrading

You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time, all the time, now

We are hard and grey, always praised to do what they say
Calling me deranged, feeling power, I must take its place some way

Never gonna run away, seeking out the path, but the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I'm insane, so dangerous, don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel, got me strained, so betrayed, get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins

We are the ones reaching out in vain, trying to solve our problems

How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means nothing to me

Victimized, deceived, a black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease, the black veil of insanity misleads

Our hearts are free
Does that mean anything?
Do what we're told, self-seeking hypocrisy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means fuck to me

Victimized, deceived, a black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease, the black veil of insanity misleads

Black veil, it's coming for me, it's coming for me, it's coming for me
It's coming for me, it's the black veil of insanity, it's coming for me
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free

Victimized, deceived, a black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease, the black veil of insanity misleads

Sometimes things get in the way, my thoughts I cannot convey
It's all pointing straight at you
We hate loving everyday
Our lives, twirled in every way, I give it all back to you

I can't help this going down

I can't take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That's what we do, we do

Sometimes, things don't go away
In turn, you just run away
It's all coming back for you, betrayed, life is in decay
Your thoughts you cannot obey
Right now, whatcha gonna do?

I can't help this going down

I can't take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That's what we do, we do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do

I hear the calling of the helpless stranger
He's all alone and no one gets his anger
I feel this pain everytime I'm here with you, with you
All the heartache and the fucked up insults
I find you begging on your knees, I figured
This is how it's supposed to be with you, with you

I can't wait for your lies to be broken down
I gave you Hell

I can't take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That's what we do
I can't take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That's what we do

Hey you, hey you, devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs, turn it up, turn it up
The wind is coming through, can't get enough

A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on your breast, your dress
Vibrations coming through, you're in a mess

A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt
Says who, says who?  Anesthetize this bitch!
A-nes-the-tize this bitch, anesthetize!
Just let me be, between you and me, don't fit
Don't fit!

Music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor.

Es ist Montagmorgen, 7 Uhr, ein neuer Tag beginnt
Stehe auf, zieh' mich an, Augenringe bis zum Kinn
Aber irgendwas is' anders, warum bin ich gut gelaunt?
Draußen regnet es in Strömen und ich steh' stundenlang im Stau

Was ist mit mir los? Sonst eher 'n Misanthrop
Heute bin ich sogar froh über die Leute im Büro
Ich würde gerne weiter alles scheiße finden, aber kann ich nicht
Ich fand' das vorher besser, ich war gerne angepisst

Doch ich kann (doch ich kann)
Nichts dafür (nichts dafür)
Das ist alles, alles wegen dir (wegen dir)
Und es liegt (und es liegt)
Nicht an mir (nicht an mir)
Das ist alles (das ist alles)
Wegen dir

Das ist alles wegen dir (wegen dir)
Wegen dir (wegen dir)
Wegen dir
Ich kann mich nicht konzentrier'n
Wegen dir (wegen dir)
Wegen dir (wegen dir)
Ich muss alle 3 Sekunden Facebook aktualisieren
Wegen dir

Auf einmal ist die Stadt wunderhübsch mit ihren Platten aus Beton
Selbst was im Radio kommt gar nicht so kacke wie sonst
Sogar irgendwie ganz gut der neue Song von Beyoncé
Selbst die Frida Gold Single is' - nein, is' sie nich'

Aber davon abgesehen ist auf einmal alles schön
Was ist mein Problem? Warum hab' ich kein Problem?
Außerdem wann, wie und wo wir uns wiederseh'n
Meine Freunde fragen: "Alter, wie lang' soll das noch so geh'n?"

Doch ich kann (doch ich kann)
Nichts dafür (nichts dafür)
Das ist alles, alles wegen dir (wegen dir)
Und es liegt (und es liegt)
Nicht an mir (nicht an mir)
Das ist alles (das ist alles)

Das ist alles wegen dir (wegen dir)
Wegen dir (wegen dir)

Ich kann mich nicht konzentrier'n
Wegen dir (wegen dir)
Wegen dir (wegen dir)
Ich muss alle 3 Sekunden Facebook aktualisieren
Wegen dir

Schlecht gelaunt, die Welt ist schuld, damit kam ich besser klar
Aber irgendwie ist heute alles anders als es gestern war

Doch ich kann nichts dafür
Das ist alles, alles wegen dir
Und es liegt nicht an mir
Das ist alles wegen dir

Doch ich kann (doch ich kann)
Nichts dafür (nichts dafür)
Das ist alles, alles wegen dir (wegen dir)
Und es liegt (und es liegt)
Nicht an mir (nicht an mir)
Das ist alles (das ist alles)

Ich hab' mich schon wieder blamiert

Warum zur Hölle bin ich eigentlich hier?

Ich hab unsere Fans schon gekannt, da kannte die noch keiner
Damals ging es nicht um Uhren, schnelle Autos oder Weiber
Früher als noch jeder von denen was zu sagen hatte
Da ging's um Ideale, da ging es um die Sache
Vor paar Jahren waren die echt, da war der Scheiß noch raw
15 Uhr auf Festivals, 30 Gäste bei der Show
Doch alles, was sie mitgeschrien haben, war gelogen
Die sind doch mittlerweile alle nach Berlin gezogen
Und jetzt von keinem aus der Band noch den Taufnamen kenn'
Ja, Ja, aber Hauptsache Fan
Die waren mir mal sympathisch, doch dann auf einmal bekannt
Nur noch Marken im Schrank und total arrogant

Unsere Fans haben sich verändert

Seitdem unsere Fans jeder kennt, haben die sich voll verändert
Früher liefen unsere Fans noch nicht auf jedem Sender
Damals war das alles noch nicht so wie heutzutage
Mittlerweile zahlen die ernsthaft 30 Euro für 'ne Karte!
Unsere Fans waren mal dagegen, die wollten nicht gefallen
Früher kleine Läden und jetzt nur noch volle Hallen
Und ich fand die mal gut, die waren treu und korrekt
Doch ist man drei Minuten weg, feiern die 'nen neuen Act!
Und vom Bassisten der Band nicht die Geschwister zu kennen
Ja, Ja, so ein richtiger Fan
Von denen hatte ich mal Plakate an der Wand, aber nicht grade lang
Die waren kurz interessant, aber dann zu bekannt

Meine Mutter sagt: Junge geh mal schlafen, fahr mal in' Urlaub
Aber ich soll auf die Straße, sagt Farin Urlaub
Ja okay, jetzt steh ich hier, doch bin allein vor einer Wand
Da bin nur ich und sonst nichts, nur dieser Stein in meiner Hand

Es ist ein einsamer Krieg gegen den Dreck, der mich umgibt
Den verfickten Dreck, den scheinbar keiner außer mir sieht
Aber wie auch, wenn niemand rausschaut
Lieber auf der Couch mit 'Frauentausch' oder 'Bauer sucht Frau'

Und ja natürlich nur ironisch und nur so nebenbei
Aber im Vergleich mit den Opfern da ist das eigene Leben schon geil
Ein Hund beißt nicht, wenn er bellt und alles ist gut
Solange die auf RTL noch bisschen dümmer sind als du

Und ich schieße in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Ich ziehe in den Krieg, aber keiner zieht mit
Drei Schüsse in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Der einzige hier draußen bin leider wieder ich
Und ich schieße in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Doch keine Reaktion, nur Beschwerden über Krach
Drei Schüsse in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Die Revolution oder 'Berlin Tag und Nacht'

Du wirst nicht enttäuscht, wenn du nie etwas erwartest
Und bevor du etwas falsch machst, dann mach mal lieber gar nichts
Irgendjemand sagt schon irgendwann mal irgendwas
Ansonsten musst du halt zufrieden sein mit dem was du hast

Und selbst wenn alles scheiße ist, du pleite bist und sonst nichts kannst
Dann sei doch einfach stolz auf dein Land
Oder gib die Schuld ein paar anderen armen Schweinen
Hey, wie wäre es denn mit den Leuten im Asylbewerberheim?

Und nein ich war nie Anti-Alles, ich war immer Anti-Ihr
Doch hab schon lange angefangen mich mit Dingen zu arrangieren
Und genau das wollte ich nie, ich bin schon viel zu lange hier
Ich muss hier weg, denn ansonsten werde ich irgendwann wie ihr

Ich schieße in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Ich ziehe in den Krieg, aber keiner zieht mit
Drei Schüsse in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Der einzige hier draußen bin leider wieder ich
Und ich schieße in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Doch keine Reaktion, nur Beschwerden über Krach
Drei Schüsse in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Die Revolution oder 'Berlin Tag und Nacht'

Allen ist alles egal, außer der Handyvertrag
(Und ich male alles schwarz)
Mit 390 Euro Harz kommt man nicht weit im Biomarkt
(Und ich male alles schwarz)
Dein verkackter Kommentar war natürlich nur ein Spaß, alles klar
(Und ich male alles schwarz)
Die ganze Nacht besoffene Vollidioten bedienen an der Bar
Für 7 Euro die Stunde, aber schwarz

Ich schieße in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Ich ziehe in den Krieg, aber keiner zieht mit
Drei Schüsse in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Der einzige hier draußen bin leider wieder ich
Und ich schieße in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)
Doch keine Reaktion, nur Beschwerden über Krach
Drei Schüsse in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)

Ich schieße in die Luft (bäng, bäng, bäng)

Ich komme aus Böblingen bei Stuttgart (Uncool!)
Jetzt wohn ich in Berlin, seit 18 Monaten
Und muss sagen, ich bin echt angekomm' (Aha!)
Meine Kleidung unterstreicht meinen Charakter
Meine Brille ist nicht Vintage, verdammt die ist Retro!

Undercut und Jutebeutel, ich trinke Club-Mate
Oder gibt's den Caffè Latte auch mit Sojamilch? (I like!)
Die große Frage: Schreibt mich irgendjemand auf die Gästeliste?
(Äh, na ja) - Bitte, bitte, bitte!

Und ich damit komplett alleine bin

Ich will nicht nach Berlin!

Ich habe da gerade so'n Projekt (Super!)
Noch nichts Konkretes, aber sehr geil
Businessmäßig hab' ich mich da noch nicht festgelegt
Irgendwas im "Creative"-Bereich (Auf jeden Fall!)
Bloß kein Nine-to-Five-Job (No-Go!) - Find ich ja megaätzend!
Genau, ich mach einfach einen Fashion-Blog (Geil!)
Und laufe dann mit meiner Spiegelreflex durch Friedrichshain
Und mache Fotos von "Streetart" und interessanten Leuten
Hauptsache hier in Berlin!

Ich weiger' mich das hinzunehm', alle stehn nur da
Dabei passieren so viel schlimme Dinge jeden Tag
Unzumutbarkeiten wie die neuen Folgen Scrubs
Generell Mario Barth, doch die Leute wollen das
Mittlerweile kommt zum dritten Mal dasselbe Lied
Das ist keine Musik, das sind die Black Eyed Peas
Wir müssen rausgehn, hier darf man nicht mehr rauchen an der Bar
Die Welt geht vor die Hunde, Mädchen, traurig aber wahr

Doch wenn du mich küsst schreibt schreibt Noel wieder Songs für Liam
(Wenn du mich küsst, wenn du mich küsst)
Kommen unsere Freunde zurück aus Berlin
(Wenn du mich küsst)
Und wenn du mich küsst, dann ist die Welt ein bisschen weniger scheiße
(Wenn du mich küsst, wenn du mich küsst)
Bleibst du hier oder gehen wir beide?
(Wenn du mich küsst)

Hättest du mich mal ein bisschen früher geküsst
Dann wäre AIDS jetzt besiegt und die Nineties nicht zurück
Uns beide hätte man nicht in der S-Bahn kontrolliert
Und Josh Homme hätte nie die Arctic Monkeys produziert
Vieles wäre nie passiert, Dinge, die vermeidbar sind
Dann gäb es keinen einzigen romantischen Til-Schweiger-Film
Daran kann man nix ändern, das war alles gestern
Aber du hast jetzt die Chance, unsere Zukunft zu verbessern

Endless summer days
That I spent with you
Under the light and shades
Eons old and new
Watchin' the sun go down in the deepest blue
Far in the distance sounds, only waves come through

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We're endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
In the deepest blue
In the deepest blue

Endless summer days
That I spent with you
Into the salty haze
Of our wildest youth
Watchin' the sun go down in the deepest blue
Far in the distance sounds, only waves come through

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We're endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
In the deepest blue
In the deepest blue

Swimming in the deepest
Swimming in the deepest
We're in the deepest blue

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We're endless like the sea, a never-ending flow

Drivers out on the bridge
Slowing down as they go through a lane shift
Wires snap
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling

At the end of the work day
Stuck in traffic, don't feel when the road sways
Underneath
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling

To their partners and kids
Don't suspect anything 'til the bridge splits
Wires snap
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling down

Where I sat, I saw brake lights flash
And I pictured them, all the people
Their faces in free fall, the water beneath
I pushed my palms against the table hard to see if it hurt

Were it glass, would I have shattered it?
Could I battle every impulse to panic and then win
Swim out through the metal twisting
Upward like a sculpture or some terrible beast?

People trapped in their cars
Put both feet on the glass and then kick hard
Water pours in
Seatbelts twist
River flowing
And everything going down

People under the water line
Workers sift through the wreckage of it, find
Seatbelts stuck
Water fills up
River flowing
And everything going downstream

On the dining room wall, I watched it
Play in the reflection of the television
The reversal in the mirror hung, I could see it all
How the dust clouds gather color as they billow out
Shades change shifting in the night
From the lights atop an ambulance
Like a firework's flash, then that otherworldly glow
In the smoke thrown in the aftermath blows
Almost frozen for a moment there
I could see it all

Every dust cloud
Shattered glass
Billow out on the TV
Wires snap
And the concrete gives
Metal twists up and onward

I can see it all
Every dust cloud
Shattered glass
Billow out on the TV
Wires snap
And the concrete gives in
Metal twists up and onward, I watch
And I can see it all

All the wreckage
All the cars piled
In the river and the rail yard
The metal twists
Wires snap
Concrete blocks split
And dangle from tie rods
And metal twists up

Wires sway
When a breeze blows
In the distant
Sirens glow
I can see it all

Where they look for survivors
Searchlights float
Change the color of smoke clouds
And shadows still fall
People under the water

People trapped in their cars
Kick and try to get out
People still with their seat belts on
Pets they had in the back
And car seats

And I watch it on TV lying down here
On the floor in the dining room, reversed in the mirror
Where I know I'm not dreaming now
But I know I've been sleeping
I just don't know since when
I only know that it's light outside
I only know that the rent is still late
When did they find out the concrete gave?
When did they learn that the wires snapped?

Morning after snowstorm, stand in the silence
Almost feel reborn, all alone on the street
It's a certain sort of stillness
When the quiet surrounds you
The only sound, your shovel on concrete

I remember those piles from the snow plows
Always seemed much bigger back when I was kid
Pushed all of the snow to the end of the driveway
I was the only person up in the neighborhood
Morning after snowstorm

I turned the ignition
And I started my car
Morning after snowstorm
I scraped off my windshield
With the edge of a credit card

I remember that drive into work
Still can hear the voice coming over the radio
Listen to our experts
Give the best tips
For the next time you entertain dinner guests

I thought of the day
In a tie in the kitchen, I sat
And I watched you put make-up on
Thought of the day
In the basement when I played house

I felt ashamed
That I'd stayed in my head
In the same place for so long
Because I was afraid to change
But that's not an excuse to stay

Morning after snowstorm
I climbed up on the snowbank
And I stared at the neighborhood
Morning after snowstorm
I think I finally understood
What they meant when they said
There's a calm after the storm

Saw my grandpa at his workbench
Building grandma's bookshelf
Watched a woman walk her trash out to the street

Father alone on the highway
I heard the salt trucks
And neighbors off to work
Saw my mother
Saw how history loops
Around all of these moments
And then I saw you

In a dress there
With your eyes open wide
To put make-up on
Thought of the day
In the basement that I played house

And I felt ashamed
I'd ignored all the hands
That extended before and around me
Because I was afraid to change
But that's not an excuse to stay

It's not an excuse

I knew it was far too late
To walk out on the lake then
Halfway to the middle thawed
I wasn't doing all that great
Had I cut my hair short?
Had I grown my beard out long?
Had I gone to school or...;?
Why do all my plans fall through?

There's a leak in the basement
Stupid permanent estrangement
Casement windows need glazing
Hinges and arms need be replaced

All the way at the edge
I said, I think that we should head back
What if now the ice cracked?
Think I felt it bend
We took opposite steps
Tried to even the stress
Picked a safe direction but
You never know the way the ice thins

Half-asleep in dreams where
Ceilings start collapsing
Free fall through the roof beams
Get startled back awake
Before you hit the pavement
Floor of the foundation
Water in the basement
Bodies in the lake

Don't panic, I could hear you
Saying as I fell through
Blackness complete down
Waiting 'til my feet touched ground
At the bottom, they finally did
First reaction was this is it
Next thought was just stay calm
Kick up and save your phone

Because I wanted to tell you
Because I thought you should know

Because I thought it might scare you
To see me under the ice
Make you remember you cared for me
What would you do if I died?
Would you fly out for my funeral?
Get too drunk at my wake?
Would you make a scene then
Climb in and try to resuscitate me?

I was on the ice and I was underwater

I was getting pulled out
I was in my wet clothes
Stumble on the walk back
Someone stoked the fire at camp
I was by the flames
Trying to get my body warm
I was standing naked
Checking to see if my phone still worked

I will cut my hair short
Trust me, I will
I will let my beard go
Trust me, I will
I will never tempt fate
Not once, I swear
I will never trust ice
I will never trust a thing

Funny what you think of after a collapse
While lying in the dirt
The first thing that comes back
Is never quite what you'd have guessed
And if you could have
You probably would've said you'd check
If all your limbs were intact
Still and then try to get out

We played house with the
Neighbors in their basement
Sister made me husband
She was older so I did her bidding
I remember once their dad came in
And said, "You think this is bad?
You don't know the half"
And he laughed

It's funny what things come back
The first things you see

How he sort of smiled
Like it's only a joke, but he was lying
There was something else inside of his eyes
All those secrets people tell to little children
Are warnings that they give them
Like, "Look, I'm unhappy
Please don't make the same mistake as me"

Why are those old worn out jokes
On married life told at toasts
At receptions still?

How does it never occur
How often couples get burned
And end uncertain in Splitsville?

Funny what you think of in the wreckage
Lying there in the dirt and the dust and the glass
How you're suddenly somewhere
In the desert, in the night time
And it's gettin' close to Christmas
And then her and that movie voice she uses when she reads
"Welcome to the Land of Enchantment" from a highway sign
And it's late so you take the next exit

When that trip ended, we came back
The rent was due, I was jobless
I guess in retrospect, I should've sensed decay
Then that day, how you said
"I just don't know" and I promised
We'd rearrange things
Ro fix the mess I'd made here

But I guess in the end
We just moved furniture around
But I guess in the end
We just moved furniture around
But I guess in the end
We just moved furniture around
But I guess in the end

It sort of feels like every day it's harder
To stay happy where you are
There are all these ways to look through the fence
Into your neighbor's yard

Why even risk it?
It's safer to stay distant
When it's so hard now to just be content
Because there's always something else

Now I'm proposing my own toast
Composing my own joke for those married men
Maybe I'm miserable
I'd rather run for mayor in Splitsville
Than suffer your jokes again

Album  Rooms of the House
Yesterday alone I laid everything out on the carpet
Books, kitchen things, objects with specific purpose or none
Arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored
Out of context and then considered it

First the whole picture, then everything individually
Humming along at the deadest pace imaginable
One object, then another, and then the next
And I wondered what they meant there
If they meant anything still

Found notes
Camping supplies
A book you bought in the desert
"Identifying Wildflowers"
Pictures from vacations
From parties
Kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops
On that road trip out west
Objects
Everything itself
And then memory

All of it laid out there
From the dining room
The living room
The hallway and the basement and the kitchen
From that room we called the office but never used
Even the bathroom
Everything laid out there
On the floor, on the carpet, out of context

And I sat there for hours

Today I moved everything from the floor
To the table in the dining room
Placed each thing carefully without reason
Or at least without one I understood or could describe
There on the table together
And when I was done and stepped back
I realized what I had made
Keepsakes, pictures, letters
Ordinary objects all collected there
A memorial

And I thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones
All the things you see there but don't understand
But still bring a remembered thing back vividly
Invoke someone's reality when they're together
In that place, in that way, out of context
And I knew I had to take it down before anybody else saw

Tomorrow I plan to put them all somewhere
Those things in boxes
Side of the road, attic maybe
All these things that push and pull me through history
To places I once was
Places I might've gone
Places I ended up going

Postcards
Ticket stubs from one thing or another
A personalized coffee mug
With neither your name nor mine
Phone cards and old phones
A page from an old calendar I bought once
At a thrift store and insisted on hanging
That cycles of the moon print
Photos, old boots of mine
Put them in boxes

And I sat there for hours
In the living room first
Then in the dining room
Moving things around
Picking things up and seeing where they took me

To what place in history
What moment on our timeline
Where we were, where I was
Where I thought we'd end up
In this house or on the highway
Driving somewhere near Christmas
In the desert or anywhere else

And I put them in boxes

I let the car drift some
Eye your uncomfortable pose in profile
The postures of long drives
That endless cycling of your numb and near sleeping parts

And you lean much harder than you need
When the road curves
Swerve through traffic
And the cracks in the ground
Every gesture you require
Of a drive like this night
When you fight now
You just head out of town

I let the wheel go
Over center lines
Inside a place without time
A loop through history
Eye you in periphery
Now prone in the passenger seat
It's a mystery
The ways you can sleep

I want to leave here
For where nobody goes
I want to breathe in the air of all
Those sprawling ancient spaces on earth
You said we're so scared of alone
And I knew what you meant
You want to go where it glows
All those places where your watch doesn't work

You were riding those nights
On the highway, always hiding out
Inside a songwriter's dream there
Like a scene from a song
"Born to Run" or maybe "Running on Empty"

Ones where they would leave
Certain nights when you'd fight
You couldn't stick around
So you'd head out of town
Just hit the highway and drive
Certain nights when you'd thought it was fine
But it shook you when the baby would cry

Why did you always turn around in the end?
To hear the shattering of glass on the door again?
So loud the baby couldn't sleep any more?
What didn't you find that you were looking for?

Your mother called a hardware
Set you up an interview
An answer to an ad
The bosses' daughter still remembers dinner where her father
Said he wouldn't stick his neck out for trouble again

But they did then
And those days you'd wake up
And just decide you wouldn't show
He'd show up at your door
Nights you'd skip town
He'd follow you out
Pretty soon you started falling for their daughter
And she fell for you

Drive, roll every window down
Let the desert enter, heavy and primitive in
Drift 'til rumble strips sound
Time moves so slow but I know
That you meant what you said
You want to go where it's frozen
All those places where the highways don't reach

You want to go where it glows
Somewhere that time is irrelevant
You want to go where it glows
Somewhere the spaces are infinite

You want to go where it glows
Somewhere you don't feel the hours pass by
You identified the flowers on the road
I rolled the windows down and shut off the radio

Did you ever think you'd end up here?
All those late nights you were driving alone?
You were riding to hide
Or you were looking for a brand new life
Did you ever think you'd find one back home?

Did you even think you'd get out alive?
Could you imagine then, the love you now know?

I think history's a system of roads
And there's nowhere it doesn't go

I pulled over to the side and felt no time
Off the highway with the landscape aglow
Still not sure what we were trying to find
I only know we went home

If I could play back every moment to you now
Spent lovesick and swollen on
Mornings mincing garlic
On the counter by the sink
If I could hit the instant replay
On only every good day
Would any of it catch you by surprise?

When you say, something is missing now
That's what came back to me
Normal mornings like that
Set the knife down and forget
Where I'd left it
Making breakfast
Put coffee on the stove
Then scour every counter for the knife

Don't be shy
Don't be kind
Somewhere snow collects
And bends the boughs of pines

But doesn't it seem a bit wasteful to you
To throw away all of the time
We spent perfecting our love
In close quarters and confines?
Isn't it wasteful? And I
Am terrified that it doesn't feel painful to me yet
Somewhere on top of the high rise
There's a woman on the edge of a building at the ledge
And traffic's backing up on 35

It's alright
I will fix whatever is not
The sweetness in your eyes
Just sit down, please, sit down
Here at the table and we'll talk
Somewhere televisions light up in the night

I know things weren't right
Maybe we were never cut out for the Midwest life
Maybe we'd have done much better on a coast
There are certain things I doubt we'll ever know

I know you were getting tired of my drinking
I guess I was never cut out for the coke scene
You were worried I would end up like your father
And tired of the smoke and somewhere the wind blows

Somewhere a storm touches down north in Hudsonville
Somewhere the coffee starts to boil on the stove
And somewhere the wind blows
Somewhere the river levels finally getting low
Somewhere I'm up past dawn 'til
Somewhere you live here still
Somewhere you're already gone

Somewhere a radio is playing in a living room
Says the city lacks the funds to fix the bridge

Somewhere the deer are overrun
So they're introducing wolves back on the ridge

And from here in the kitchen
I can hear the neighbors in the alley hanging linens
And the men collect the trash bins in the street
You're speaking to me but I can't understand you
The coffee is burning

And all of the times that we spent
That road trip out west
Through desert for the rest stops
The kitsch we both collect
That winter the whole weekend
We huddled by the stove
The cabin I had rented
The unexpected snow
That visit for Christmas
On television binges
We'll see friends in Brooklyn
Drive south to Richmond
There's traffic on the bridge
A woman on the ledge
And everywhere the wind

Everything is happening at once

Album  Rooms of the House
There were shadows in the bedroom
Where the light got thrown by the lamp on the night stand
On your mother's side, after midnight, still
You can see it all, you can see it all

And the closet in the corner
On the far back shelf with the keepsakes, she hid
That box there, full of letters of regret
By the pictures of the kids

You get faint recollections of your
Mother's sigh, countryside drive
And the landscape seen from the window of the back seat
With some flowers in a basket

That afternoon after school
You and your older sisters
Found your parents in the kitchen at the table
Father lifting off the lid of the box

And a hush fell
Over everything like a funeral prayer
A reverence, ancestral, heavy in the air
Though you didn't understand what it meant

That they never said her name aloud around you
Even sitting at the table with her things they'd kept
You recall faintly cards, tiny clothes
And the smell of the paint in the upstairs bedroom
Until then you didn't know that's what the box had held

Your parents tiptoeing slowly around
Always speaking in code

No, they never said her name aloud around you
Only told you it was perfect where your sister went
And you didn't understand why it hurt them
So much then that she'd come and left so soon
Could only guess inside your head at what a "stillbirth" meant
Only knew that mother wept

You watched while father held her
Said "Some things come, but can't stay here"
You saw a brightness, like a light through your eyes
Closed tight then she tumbled away

From here, some place
To remain in the night time shadows she made
To be an absence in mom
A sadness hanging over her

Like some pentecostal flame
Drifting on and off
She was "Sister" only whispered
Sometimes "Her" or "The Child We Lost"

You were visions
A vagueness
A faded image
You were visions

You were a flame lit
That burned out twice as brightly
As the rest of us did
When you left, you were light
Then you tumbled away

There are shadows that fall
Still here at a certain angle
In the bedroom on the night stand
By your mother's side
From the light left on there

There's the box in the closet
All the things kept
And the landscape where she left
Flowers on the grave
Marble where they etched that name
And mother cried the whole way home

But she never said it once out loud
On the way back home from where you thought they meant
When they said where sister went

After grandpa got hospice sick
And he couldn't fall sleep
They wheeled his stretcher bed beside her at night
And I saw the light

On the day that he died
By their bed in grandma's eyes
While us grandkids said our goodbyes

She said, "Don't cry"
Somewhere he holds her
And said a name I didn't recognize
And the light with all the shadows combined...;

You in the living room
You on a Tuesday afternoon
A breeze seen when the curtains move

You by the window with both feet up on the couch
Where you sit and you read and I watch you

From the office, the sunlight frames your silhouette
I think of lighting fireworks, I think of pirouettes
I idly write down observations on the scene
Like do the blueprints name the rooms alone?
Do we name them on our own?
We hardly live in there

You with a book propped on your knees
A breeze seen in your coffee steam

I'm in the office thinking back to rules of poetry, like
It's fourteen lines, the last two rhyme, what does pentameter mean?

You in the living room
Legs bent at forty-five degrees
I write AB AB
Try to find your rhyme scheme

I look for objects on the desk
With which to sculpt your image best
What would I name this, could I paint it?
Woman (reading)? Girl (at rest)?

I remember it so well
Watching you shifting your weight
Turning the page
I can see it all there
Inside a living room
Where only I live
And never go in
A role in name alone

And I pause where I am for a second when I hear your name
Sometimes I think I see your face in improbable places
Do those moments replay for you?
When I'm suddenly there and then won't go away
When you're sitting in the living room reading for the afternoon
Do you put your book down, look and try to find me there?

Sometimes I think of all the people
Who lived here before us
How the spaces in the memories you make
Change the room from just blueprints
To the place where you live

When you leave here
When you go from a home
You take all that you own
But the memories echo

On hardwood floor in the living room
Tore the carpet, the scratches below that we found
And the wine stain on the couch
We got drunk and decided
We'd still try to move it around

And I can't tell what the difference is
Between the ones that we made
And the ones that we didn't make
They all conjure images still
Where you sit and you read
In the sunlight, aware that I watch

And I live alone now
Save for the echoes

I live alone now
Save for the echoes

You still cross my mind from time to time
And I mostly smile
Still so set on finding out where we went wrong and
Why

So I retrace our every step with an unsure pen
Trying to figure out what my head thinks, but
My head just ain't what it used to be
And then again, what's the point anyway?

I remember you ascending all the stairs up to the balcony
To see if you could see me, hidden quietly away
I remember the skin of your fingers
The spot three quarters up I'd always touch when I was out of things to say

You held my hand, but you were too afraid to speak
You were too afraid to speak and I could never understand
I remember when you leaned in quick to kiss me, and I swear
Not a single force on earth could stop the trembling of my hand

And I remember how you smiled through the smoke
In a crowded little coffee house and laughed at all my jokes
And I remember the way that you dressed
How we wasted all the best of us in alcohol and sweat

And I remember when I knew that you'd be leaving
How I barely kept up breathing
And I bet, if I had to do it all again
I'd feel the same pain

And I remember panicked circles
In the terminal in tears
How I wept to god in fits
I've hated airports ever since

It must be true what people say
That only time can heal the pain
And every single day I feel it fade away, but

I still remember how the distance tricked us
And lead us helpless by the wrist into a pit to be devoured
I still remember how we held so strong to this
Though we had never really settled on a way out

I still remember the silence
And how we'd always find a way to turn and run to our mistakes
I still remember how it all came back together
Just to fall apart again

My dear, I hear your voice in mine

I've been alone here
I've been alone here
I've been afraid, my dear
I've been afraid, my dear

I've been at home here
I've been at home here
You've been away for years
You've been away for years

I've been alone
I've been alone
I've been alone
I've been alone

I breathed your name into the air
I etched your name into me
I felt my anger swelling
I swam into its sea

I held your name inside my heart
But it got buried in my fear
It tore the wiring of my brain
I did my best to keep it clear

So, dear, no matter how we part
I hold you sweetly in my head
And if I do not miss a part of you
A part of me is dead

If I can't love you as a lover
I will love you as a friend
And I will lay a bed before you
Keep you safe until the end

Oh, we could blame it on our hands
They lifted the drink to our mouths so we drank it
Or we could blame it on our bodies
They say, "We like the way we feel when we get touched"

You've got your fingers snared in my veins
I think it's time you pulled them out
And I don't care about the flesh it'll tear
It isn't flesh that I'm worried about

We held a match to keep our sight on the path
But the flame gave up and we lost it
And I've knelt for the last three years
Trying to find it back with the blackened matchstick

Today I'm not afraid of failure
"The past is a flower; the future, the snow"
I wasn't ever close to perfect
But I never let you go

You let your doubt like a river
Lead you on and on and on and
You will never get back
To save what you had, hear me promise, "I will
Bury your problems in me so sleep soundly"
I held your heart in my fingers
Now it's gone, it's gone, it's gone and
You will never admit
That you bid the wind blow the flames out
And buried the coals in the sea, you tricked me

You came back and you brought floods
Wearing a necklace made of hearts
That you'd dragged through the mud
And I guess I wasn't quite sure what to say to you

But then I saw mine, almost reached out to grab it. Said,
"Darling, you're the only one on Earth I want to have it"
But now I'm not so sure that that was true
After the hell you put it through

But there was no sharp pain this time
Just the ghost of your presence compressing my chest like a vine
An unshakeable absence, like most of my insides
Crawled out through my mouth and went west. But that's fine

We cast our hearts in plaster
We imagined our bodies were fashioned from stone but
They chipped at the brick and the mortar
We found out that we're only layers of skin hiding bone

And our bones are like chains
Old and rusted in the rain
They're going to snap when the weight shifts

You moved like a fire through the forest
Your hands were as red as the skin on your lips
You'd been flirting with distance, princess
I tasted its spit in your kiss

Oh, mistress, know
Today I will bury the flames of your failure
The past is a liar; the future, a whore
I'll lay your bones into the earth and you
Will haunt my head no more

Oh, we could blame it on our hands
Oh, we could blame it on our hands, but
It was our mouths that opened up to swallow
And our heads that commanded us drink

But as I buried your flames in the dirt
I watched the smoke pull your ghost from the grave. And
I fear they'll only lay in wait
Till we are face to face again

Just when I said, "I'm moving, I'm moving on"
I felt them come to life again
And again, and again, and again

There are fires
That tear through valleys and make dust from grass
There are fires

There are wires
Bound to blue light they pull us to the past
There are wires

We are tired
We should've known from the start that this thing wouldn't last
We are tired

She forced a smile, said, "Boy, come kiss my mouth.
You know that hope you're holding to? It looks an awful lot like fear.
Now, you're so quick to fall on failure, and so quick to raise your voice, like,
'If I can't find a mistake to blame, we didn't have a choice.'

Oh, but you had an option.
I was your chance to feel complete,
But when I leaned in close to you, you
Kissed your fear instead of me.

You had my hand in your hand,
You had my lip in your teeth,
You had my heart on your sleeve,
You had a chance to breathe.

But, boy, you wouldn't let your fear recede so I moved on.

And it's too late to change your mind now,
You got scared, boy, and I got gone.
Now you failed, and there's no way to turn back time.
You had your chance, boy, I tried."

"You tried?" I looked her in the eye and smiled,
"My girl, you must understand that fear is not some product that I made.
It crept unwelcome in my head the day they had her torn away.
It changed me.

Now at the end of every day I lie awake at night and wait
To feel the wires of my brain get cut and quietly rearranged, and
Hear my beaten heart exclaim, 'Still, I refuse to let her go.'

So we escape to our mistakes for they wait patiently for us.
Oh, how they always wait for me.

If my fear has kept me here, only my fear can set me free.
And I'm sorry, dear, but don't you dare speak another word.
How could I risk holding your heart in me while still in love with her?
You were wrong."

Out where the stones lay like bones by the ocean
Out where the waves crash contempt on the land
Someone was trembling for fear of the tempest
Somebody silently reached for their hand

Said, "Understand that if you're cold, I'll keep you warm
And besides, there's so much beauty in a storm
So come down with me to the shore
And what's more? I adore you

So tell me, what is there to fear?
You think some seraph up above
Is trying to rob us of our love
Because the sky's not clear?
My dear, you know there's not
Now, listen to the rain upon the rooftop"

But the wind picked up

Out where the stones stand up like thrones beside the ocean
Out where the waves make a grave of the sea
The lovers struggled in the middle of the tempest
And water angrily crawled up onto the beach

Said, "Hold my hand, and stay with me, we'll be released"
But the tide clung like an anchor to her feet
And though he tried to make the water line recede
It pulled her out into the sea

He could not break apart the waves
To bring her safely back in
He watched her hand break through the surface once
Then disappear again

Forever wait inside the sea for me
My dear, I hear you
You speak in every curling wave
And sing in every violent breeze
Someday not far away from here
My dear, I swear I'll see you
And we will hear the seraphs cry
They will still envy you and I

How they envied you and I
How they envied you and I
How they envied you and I

"My precious wife
I am in shambles
I am crumbling, I am
Was it something I did
Bid the tide
To climb so high
That it ripped our shore up?

I can fix it, I swear
If you trust me
I am old and I am rusting
But I care, I care"

"My precious wife
We made a promise
Pledged our flesh to be one
How can you doubt a love
That stood so proud as we raised our children?

I believe in
It still
It has faltered, and it is faded
But I know
It's there, it's there.

And how'd it change?
The way you thought of me?
How strange to think we once were lovers
Now we've wrapped the past up in broken glass
And when you speak my name you shudder

Oh precious wife
Please believe this
I'll revive it, I will
We've built a family from this marriage
Why would you tear it apart?"

"Oh, speak now, precious
Your silence screams
You're giving in to failure

Hear me
The promise that you made
Was meant to live forever

Until our deathbed
You're not allowed to change your mind
Was there nothing in that promise?
Are you listening to me?"

"Oh, husband, I could not control it
Husband, I could not abstain
One cannot stop the wind from blowing
Nor refuse the falling rain

Love stirred up a storm inside me
Wrapped its arms around my waist
I failed you
Dear, I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry

There was nothing I could do
No, there was nothing I could
Sure as the rain will fall
Some love just fails without a reason"

I've come here as a man in shambles
Worn out from begging on my knees
Please, I'm just trying to keep my family together
Now when you saw your lover
Wore a ring around her finger
Why didn't you stop?

I have half a mind to make you hurt
To make you bleed, to make you suffer
I swear, if you've touched her
Oh heaven, forgive what I would do
To you, you monster
Think about your children
They'll never believe what you've done

Listen, I am begging you
Back off
Let me rebuild all the things that you shattered

She meant it
I swear that she meant it
She whispered so often
"Husband, I'll always be here with you"

Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always is valueless
I wish I'd never heard her speak a word

And I hope you see us
Your wife and your children and I
Buried in the wreckage of your crime
While you're laying down your sins
Softly leaning in to kiss your guilt goodnight

She is mine, she is, she is mine
You stole her, somehow tricked her but
We'll survive, we will, we'll survive
She loves me dearly, you'll see, she
You are blind, you are, you are blind
She loves me, dearly loves me, she

Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe

He finally paused to take a breath
Then looked down
It felt like staring into hell
The man was seated in a chair
Before him, silent
A statue framed in pain and flesh

He thought, "Oh, what more can I say
To sway him?
To make this statue speak?
I swear he's made of stone and I
Am barely stirring up a breeze"
I'm barely stirring up a breeze

And after waiting
In this silence, finally
He finally turned around to leave
Broken and barely through the doorway
Breathing slowly
Beating hard, he heard him
Speak

"I guess love's a funny thing
The way it fades away without a warning
It doesn't ask to be excused
And when it's gone, oh, it's gone
And it ain't ever comin' back

There is nothing you can do to save it
To make it breathe the way it did
When you were sliding on the ring
Trust me, it's gone for
Good

Now there is nothing you can do to stop me
She is happy when she is with me and I am
I am finally alive
I'm sorry"

Scars will remain

I say we scrape them from each other, darling

They stored their passion in the creases
In the corners of their mouths
Every angle of light from the open window
Washed their aged faces out

"Should we feel guilty?" they said
"Should we feel guilty for this sin?
Lord, did we kill a man and woman
Just to lie here skin to skin?"

"I wasn't happy
I wasn't happy where I was
Oh, what is life without a purpose?
What is purpose without love?

I pray my children will forgive me
Though I bade the river flood
I have washed my hands a thousand times
But still can see the blood

I still can see the blood"

"Oh, great mercy, I am here
To beg forgiveness for this mess
I know I tore two worlds apart
But I can't change the way I felt

Love swept in like a storm
And ripped the hinges from the doors
Love poured in like a flood
I couldn't stop it any more

I will not be
No, I will not be
Drowned"

She said, "Lover, come and hold me
I'm terribly afraid
While you're shouting at the stars
My scars are not fading away"

He said, "Darling, I was begging
Heaven make them disappear
But see, I didn't get an answer
Or at least one I could hear

Now, I am thinking of the past
And how we both said vows and lied
And I am wondering how we trust ourselves
To say a second time

To say a second time"

To have and to hold
From this day and onward
For better or for worse
For richer or poorer
In sickness and in health
To love and to cherish
Till death do us part
Till death do us part

And how we've trembled at the way that time assembles little fires of desire in the tundra of our skin. So do yourself a little favor, savor every time you waver for that shaking in my voice was only slyly feigned chagrin. Tonight we ride.

Tonight we ride

Oh, lover, uncover. I know it's warm beneath your sheets, and there is ice along the streets, but listen, lover, we will recover. But we've no time to waste with meddling in affairs, we've locked so tightly in our dreams. We are not clean, we are not pure, we will not rest until we're sure. So rob your pretty little eyes of sleep's disguise. I'm at your bedside with a bucket full of lies, so clear your ears and listen. Up, my lady, pack your things, this place is not your home.

And I know what is

And to the glorious past: You've opened my window but broken the glass. And I beseech thee, 'shed thy beauty.' For as a child leaves the womb and learns the cold, you have taught us peril in the present, and you will bring us peril in our surely-soon-will-be. Unless...;

The river's not flooded this time

Oh, precious distance
Oh, precious pain
You've given me a name
And etched it in the stones of the river bank

Oh, precious distance
Oh, precious pain
You've given us a name
You've given us a name

"Rise!" said the King to the River, "Never let up! No, bring us a flood and bring it hard!" "Freeze!" said the Wind to the Water, "Never give in! No, build us a bridge! And build it strong and angry. Let it stall the King's decrees. Oh, you must contemplate the current, Boy, and command that coward cease. The boy breathes for his love says, 'I wait.' His love says, 'I wait.' She's shouting out, "I will come back. Yes, I will come back! And I will come. I have lived my life so uncomfortably. Darling, come for me, come for me."

"Rise!" said the Boy to his Lover, "Darling, get up. I've brought you my love, and brought it far!"
"Leave!" said the Girl to her Lover, "I've given in. If love is a bridge, we built it wrong!"

Curb your anger
Still your fists
She will never come back
She'll never come back
She'll never come
Never come back
She'll never come back
She'll never come

I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise
That your body couldn't keep
I think I saw you in my sleep

I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise
That your body couldn't keep
I think I saw you in my sleep

I thought I heard the door open, oh no
Thought I heard the door open but I only heard it close
I thought I heard a plane crashing
But now I think it was your passion snapping

I think you saw me confronting my fear, it
Went up with the bottle and went down with the beer and
I think you ought to stay away from here
There are ghosts in the walls and they
Crawl in your head through your ear

I think I saw you in my sleep, lover
I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every mangled promise
That your body couldn't keep
I think I saw you in my sleep

Now speak of anger
Forget all the fears you've kept
About love and sex and death and faith
Erased, or swinging sweet
From around her neck

And between her breasts
Let every lonely body
Finally break its fear of flesh
And say, "How strange it must've been
Back when we shook at the sight of sweat"

And let our worries wander out
Like water streaming from a spring
And sing of all the things
Our heads have failed to ruin
There's so much they have failed to ruin yet

Bright as lightning
Loud as thunder
We'll move all the hurt aside
To let love sustain our passions
And move up and onward
We are not our losses
We are only the extent to which we love

So build a home for your family
And build a castle for your friends
Now set their beds with sheets and blankets
Keep them safe until the end

I've felt the damage and burn from the fallout
My love failed but theirs prevailed
My friends, I'm only flesh and bone
But I won't let you die alone

So leave our hearts at the foot of the mountain
Let our burdens be locked in the stone
If you will help me roll it upward
I won't let you die alone

I see a beauty springing upward
From the earth and from out our hearts
For all the bad that seems to plague us
I swear to you there's good

No, oh, I won't let you die alone
My love, I will not let you die alone

They say that death is not a problem
It's a promise
I can only say for sure
That when it makes your bed
I'll kiss your head goodnight

So speak of all the love we lost
And what it cost us
Left us beg our breath to stop
But we kept on
And we were strong
And we, and we

Stayed bright as lightning
We sang loud as thunder
We moved ever forward
We are not our failures
We are love

I felt your sickness
Brush against my arm
As I walked by you
Heard your voice but
Couldn't tell that it was you

And slowly
Watched your sickness slip away
Into a place
That I'd once feared, but I
Was not afraid this time

So I gave chase and found it, finally
Slowly feeding from your head
And from my friends, and from my family
So I grabbed it by the neck

"For every lover you have ruined...;"
I dug my nails into its flesh
"...;and every life that you have taken"
Slammed its head against the brick

Its blood poured out onto the pavement
I stirred it in with dirt and spit
"I will take a part of you"
I made mortar from the mix

Tore every organ from its body
Broke its bone and fashioned bricks
I laid the mortar in between
I made a throne for hope to sit

"Too long you've torn us into pieces
Firmly held onto our wrists
Today I bury you in me"
I swallowed every inch of it


I'll
I'll hold you
As you have held me
You've held me in your heart

We'll be
We'll be set free from
We'll be set free from
Fear, we'll be set free

Oh we've felt our failures
We've watched our passions
Leave, but we're still breathing
Oh but we're still beating on

I'll
I'll hold you
As you have held me
You've held me in your heart

(And I will hold you in my heart)


But I still see him
Dead in the parking lot
At the gas station just down the street

And I still hear my friend say
"You know, you wouldn't believe the things
I saw when I was stationed overseas"

But he somehow keeps smiling
In spite all of that
While I keep finding ways
To push the good out for the bad

Oh how selfish of myself
To always say that it was
More than I could take
Like it was pain I couldn't shake
Like it could break me with its fingers
Throw my body in the lake
And I would slowly sink away

But the truth is, it was sorrow
That I made
And wouldn't face
See, I keep falling for the future
After tripping on the past
And I am always tearing sutures out
To make the anguish last

Like it defines me
Or reminds me
I've found comfort in my suffering
And uncertainty in happiness and death
Because what's next is such a mystery to me
And I am terrified of all the things
I feel but cannot see

Friends and family
Put your hand into my hand
And lay your head into my chest
You are all that I have left here
We are all that we have left

We are the lovers
We are the last of our kind
So link your arms and keep your chin up
And I swear that we'll be fine

We are the lovers
We are the last of our kind


Though we are not sure who we are
We keep our heads up
Though we are not sure where we're from
We keep our hearts up
Though we are not sure when we'll leave
We keep our heads up
Though we are not sure where we'll go
We keep our hopes up

Though we're not sure who we are
We keep our heads up
Though we're not sure where we're from
We keep our hearts up
Though we're not sure when we'll leave
We keep our heads up
Though we're not sure where we'll go
We keep our hopes up


Keep your head up
We're fine
Just keep your head up
I swear we'll be alright

Keep your head up
My friends, my friends
Keep your head up
I swear

I swear we'll never die, I swear
We'll get home safe and sound, I swear
I swear we'll never die, I swear
We'll live on underground, I swear


I will give your heart a place to rest
When everything you had has turned and left


I'll weave your names into my ribcage
Lock your hearts inside my chest
Regain the passion I once carried
Do away with all the rest

I tore the sickness from your bodies
Smashed its head against the bricks
I made a castle from its bones
That you may always dwell in it

So sing for every buried moment
That you'd thought would never end
And sing your fears about the future
And a dirge for faded friends

For all the love that you had held to
Why it somehow failed to keep
And sing each minute you've been frightened
Every hour that you've lost sleep

And sing for all your friends and family
Sing for those who didn't survive
But sing not for their final outcome
Sing a song of how they tried

We live amidst a violent storm
Leaves us unsatisfied at best
So fill your hearts with what's important
And be done with all the rest

We are what's left of what we once were
We are falling far behind
There's so much stacking up against us
And we're running out of time

We are but hopeful children
And we're the last of our kind
But if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never


We are but friends and family
We are the last of our kind
So hold my hand, I'll lift your head up
And I promise we'll be fine

We are but hopeful lovers
And we are running out of time
There's so much stacking up against us
And we're falling far behind

We are but hopeful lovers
We are the last of our kind
But if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never

We are but lovers
We are the last of our kind
And if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never

We are but lovers
We are the last of our kind
And if we let our hearts move outward
We will never die

I spoke too soon, it seems
For you made a home in my dreams while I slept
You kept running yourself through my head
Like, I won't be dead

Yet, I said, "You don't understand
We had no control, they stole it
Love's been so unfair to me"
"But see, boy, that's my point
You must move on"

Then felt her ghost move in me
I heard her voice call out my name but
This time it faded out, away
I'll bury it today, today

So I breathed her name out into a cold, cold room
Watched her ghost ascend the walls, and then dissolve
This time I choose to let it go

This time I choose to let her go
I will not let my fear become
The only world I've ever known

I know my heart, come kiss my mouth
And set me free, I've wounds to mend
And we'll be more than friends, my dear
I fear I've changed my mind again

But, boy, you're too late
But, boy, you're too late
My love, you're too late
Oh, God, it's too late
Too late
Too late

Pick up the phone
Blessed be the thief, disguised in skin
And blessed are the fingers that gesture him in

Paint the receiver, to the side of the fake
Lying at the bottom of the staircase
Broken elbows
And you're coming through the window

And whoever called night a blanket
Had never the felt the cold
And whoever called the night a blanket

So use your fingers, darling
And tear away at the restraints they call the body
It's the temporary things that rip us apart
For the body is but a piece of art, for you to tear to pieces

And to the night
Under the blanket, under the weight of the world
This is history to thievery

It's the crying and the screaming
For the lying and the lack thereof
And I can feel the blood as it saturates your face

This is history to thievery
These are only games we play
This is history to thievery
These are only games we play
Hang up the phone

Crows, wipe the blood off the end of your claws
Said the vulture, lets gather like storms
For the war, for the war

Crows, as the night turns its skin into coal
Dark as corpses but cluttered with gold
They will label you thieves, wolves, and whores, but

You are nothing less than angels
You are nothing less than angels
You are nothing less than angels
You are nothing less than angels
Cast down and covered in black

Ain't this the bloodiest mess in the world?
Said the virgin, a torn little girl
Boy, you went and made a sweet wreck of my soul
And I've already forgiven you

And blood was running down her dress
In streams, into her hands where she was stitching
On the flesh he'd left in sections
On the carpet near a bed that
Never slept while you was sleeping
In her clothes that he had laid with
On the floor with all his fingers
Crossed, in hoping that that distance wouldn't grow

But how it grew, and how it hurt
And how it hallowed every memory he'd
Never felt was threatened by a thing the world could
Conjure up to kill them
Oh, but he let it kill them
What a bunch of fools we lovers are

And now she's smiling
With herself put back together
Just a shadow of the past before the war, all sewn together
Like a city sick from
Storms and sick of waiting for a
God to call the floods out of her home

What a bunch of fools we lovers are, we lovers are
When tempted by the taste of flesh

"My boy, you are nothing more
Than a thief and a whore in a suit of the finest of armor"
Laughed the vulture, laughed the vulture
"Pathetic little child, I am embarrassed for you"

I'm reading over your shoulder
It says it in every line
In every curve and crack

It says it in every detail of your face
Unmistakably apparent in this dull light
Tracing a separate letter and forming a separate word

Twisting together
To build the same beautiful sentence
The same painful realization

The cracks in your lips
Open with the book
And the smile shows the lines in your face
Perfectly crooked
And perfectly familiar

The cracks in your lips
Open with the book
And the smile shows the lines in your face
Perfectly crooked
And perfectly familiar

And by the moment
Uncovered like a statue
Lay perfectly still
To show the cracks in your lips
Give purpose to this pattern and start to smile

Burst into flames, disappear
Before your best intentions
Can no longer hide her ears
From that which will make them bleed

Or your own two hands become too weak
To hold the blood inside the wounds

Or reality explodes before you
In a brilliant flash of spectral fire
To a thousand fragments of a past
Long dead and gone

This is remembering the last time we touched
The last time we spoke
Words ricocheting off empty tables

Vandalizing the pictures on these smoke-stained walls
And I can feel your mouth
As it opens from across the room

Your tongue and lips, forming the shape of your laughter
It's the curve of your stomach, it's the bend in your legs
It's the remnants of pages framed in the cracks of your bleeding lips
It's the curve of your stomach, it's the bend in your legs

Your crooked teeth
Oh, your crooked teeth, your crooked teeth
Oh, your crooked teeth, your crooked teeth
Oh, your crooked teeth, your crooked teeth

I'm reading over your shoulder
It says it in every line
In every curve and crack

The same stupid message in every stupid bend
In every stupid stitch
In every inch of our peeling skin

It's tracing the letters in the same sentence
It's screaming the same stupid thing
Like the howling of a plane
Playing over and over and over and over and over
And over and over and over and over and over...;

Don't call this an art project
This is science, this is progress
And don't pretend these are heartfelt words
We are children dressed as surgeons
But disturbed by the sight of our scars
And now we carry scalpels
To trace the scarring
Resting somewhere on the line between my house
Your heart and into your home

Where you lay sleeping like a ceiling fan in winter
Gently turning as the wind reaches its fingers through the window
Just to hold you, like I held you
Pressed like a rose between my fingers
Or like stones I keep in pockets
Meant to weigh me underwater
Meant to keep me underwater
I meant to keep me underwater

These scars will fade away but never disappear, my dear
We'll raise our fists like lightning rods to god and
If he strikes us down, then he strikes us down
But first, let him hear us speak
We are like the legacy of thunderstorms
We watched and swore in doorways
That we would never be the same again

I can feel you healing and I hate it
Like a harpist without hands
You only bang the strings
You used to love to touch so much
To hear the dissonance drain violently
Into the air and then dissolve
Like all the songs I sang
But never once could make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile

Oh, my god, I would kill to make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile
My god, I would kill to make you smile, smile, smile

And reach out to my hands, soft and frail
To make good on the love that you swear
Still exists, and still thrives
Though we've buried our bodies in blood
And old lies, like, "I'm fine"
And "You look so much better than him"

But don't trust the surgeon with your heart
She's drunk and sips from poison cups
And don't you trust the scientist
He says "Life is like a wineglass"
As he spills his drink, like secrets
All across your dress and says
"My dear, I must confess
I never thought you ever knew
What love was like for real
I never thought you needed me"

Oh, you've a pretty mouth
Leave your lips to linger on my skin
And kiss me one last time
I will roll off your tongue like a whisper

In the winter
Sleeping in the
Sutures of the
City's skin

Make yourself remember me
In cold and concrete

Oh, when will you realize
Oh, the city makes you real?
When will you realize
Your demons make you real?

Oh, you've a pretty mouth
Leave your lips to linger on my skin
And kiss me one last time
I will roll off your tongue like a whisper

Sleeping in the
Sutures of the
City's skin

Make yourself remember me
In cold and concrete

It's the way my hands felt
Lying still beneath your dress
It's the way my hands felt

Oh, I am transparent
Oh, I am a greenhouse filled with ghosts
I am transparent, oh

Oh dear god
Oh my god

Whisper secrets
Speak in a hushed voice
The first thing that you learn
Is that you never let them hear you

In a soundproof room
In a windowless world
Keep your voice down
Or dull your words

Then put on your bedroom face for him
All pursed lips
And half-closed eyes
With pink-stained skin
Screaming for sleeping hands on downed dresses

Screaming
For dead legs come alive
For dead legs come alive

For dead legs come alive

Oh dear god
There is no excuse for me

Oh dear god
What have I done?

I still love you
But I don't love myself

So here goes...;

One last letter now
One last attempt to make sense
Who have I been writing to?
I'm not sure any more

What have I been trying to accomplish?
It's a mystery, I guess
Self-made secrecy
Things get cloudy and now

All these stories and the
Struggle as an undercurrent
Both get blurry by the minute
Both get blurrier

So which voice is this then
That I am writing in?
Is it my own or his?
Has there ever been a difference
Between them at all?

I don't know
I don't know

One last desperate plea
One last verse to sing
One last laugh track to
Accompany the comedy

Have I been losing it completely
Losing sanity? Or
Has it been fabricated
Fashioned by the worst of me?

I know I knocked the table over
Because I watched the jar break
And I've been trying to repair it
Every single stupid day

But won't the cracks still show
No matter how well it's assembled?
Can I ever just decide
To let it die
And let you go?

All my motives and
Every single narrative below
Reflects that moment when it broke
And will I never let it go
No matter what?

Now I am throwing all the shards away
Discarding every fragment
And fumbling uncertain
Towards a curtain call

That no one wants to happen
That no one's going to clap for at all
But that still has to be

...for everything

Night fell on me writing this
And I ran out of paper
So I crossed the name out
At the top of the page

Not sure why I'm even writing this
But I guess it feels right
It sort of feels like I have to
Like an exorcism

I guess that makes me sound crazy
But that's alright
Lately I feel like I might be
Not that I've heard any voices or anything

Just like that everyday kind
Where you forget things you shouldn't
And you think too much about death

Maybe you know what I'm talking about?
Or maybe you would have known?
Or had known? Is it once knew?
I don't know what tense to use

I know I never used to feel like this
I used to never think of death or hear voices
I used to feel like everything was perfectly in order
A normal life, but I guess then came a departure

That I know you understand
Or would've understood
I guess things changed after that
And I'm mostly scared now

But it's there in the stories
Or whatever they are
You can see it
Anybody could, if they could look

I wrote some notes in the
Margins explaining it
The rest is in between lines
Or in the fine print

First, the feeling of abandonment
Then trying to cope
Then death and hope and the thing itself
Waiting for me

It's all there in the pages
Ahead of here
It's there, waiting for you
Or for me; I'm not sure

The whole story

For everything
For everything

Everybody wants a reason for everything
It's so much easier with someone or something to blame
I've always struggled at the root of the problem
Has it been absence or my constant lack of defense?

I've never spent a lot on finding a remedy
I guess I figured that it hurt for a reason, I guess
That's why I've always turned to writing it down
Not just in stories, but the letters in between, and

I guess that's why it haunts the pages of everything
To self-examine

I think the thing is that I shut off from everything
From friends and family and my own ambitions
From having fun; I just shut off from everything
Self-defeating? Yeah, probably, but I don't

Know that I had total control over it
And I'm not sure it even matters why
Sometimes things happen and you can't do anything
Plus, I'm the only one who deals with it anyway

So if everyone could do me a favor and just
Put their fingers down, I'd — and keep your mouths

Sorry, I know I seem angry. I'm not, I...;
I promise, I just know I did this to me
And I will deal with it accordingly, and I
Don't need opinions from those never a part of it

Don't need them pointing out my problems, they're mine
Don't need reminders; I know better than anyone
And yeah I know, I should be finding another way
I know that I should be out seeking a substitute

But just forgetting never really made sense to me
So I haven't been

Do I feel embarrassed about it?
I think you know the answer to that
I think you'd probably feel a little bit
Embarrassed for me, wouldn't you?

I know I should've moved on ages ago
Been happy already, but
It's never been that easy for me
Or maybe it was me that made it so hard

I know I've only ever tried a handful of times
To sever this thing torturing me
It never got me anywhere
With anyone; no friendship or hobby, no lover's bed worked

But looking back I maybe never tried hard enough
And it is my fault
Maybe I never tried at all

Third time writing you a letter
Getting darker
I'm getting worse
And worse

I had a reason for the writing
But trying to exorcise my demons didn't work
To try to rid me of the worry and to purge
You out of wonder for the future and the hurt
I wrote a poem

I'm increasingly aware
I've been painting things in gray
I'm increasingly alarmed by the pain
I'm increasingly alive
To every cloud up in the sky
I'm increasingly afraid it's gonna rain

See, lately I've
Hated me, for over-playing pain
For always pointing fingers out
At everyone, but who in fact is guilty

And for picking at my scabs
Like they could never break
But they can and they will
And I'll spill like a leak in the basement

A drunk in the night choir
Just slur all those words
To make deadbeat that
Sweet old refrain

Self-inflicting my pain
And therein lies the real shame
I heard when they were
Picking through the rubble

Finding limbs, they sang hymns
But now what of what I see?

The worry, the wonder
The shortness of days
The replacement for purpose
The things swept away

By the worry, the wonder
My slightness of frame
The replacements for feeling
The casual lay

And the worst of the wildlife
Wears clothes and can pray
And the worry, the wonder
For three meals a day

Only death unimpeded
Not slowing it's pace
Brings that petty, old worry
And wonder away

Name  a Poem
Artist  La Dispute
Album  Wildlife
So now, tell me how your story goes
Have you ever suffered?
If so, did you get better or have you
Never quite recovered from it?

Did you find your lover laying
In your bedroom with another and then
Did you let it hover over you
And everything else well after the fact?

Show me all your bruises
I know everybody wears them
They broadcast the pain
How you hurt, how you reacted

Did cancer take your child?
Did your father have a heart attack?
Have you had a moment force
The whole heart to grow or retract?

Or just shrink
Does the heart shrink?


Tell me everything
Tell me everything you know

Were you told as a child
How cruel the whole world can be?
Did anybody ever tell you that?

Tell me what your purpose is?
Who it was that put you here, and why?
Did anybody really put you here at all?

And what of those necessities?
Like how to cope with tragedy and pain?
Did anybody ever show you how?

When it hits, will my heart burst or break or grow strong?
Is there really only one way to know now?

I'm not sure if I'm ready yet to find out the hard way
How strong I am, what I'm made of
I'm not sure I am ready yet to walk through the fire
I'm not sure I can handle it

Do you think if the heart keeps on shrinking
One day there will be no heart at all?
And how long does it take?
Am I better off just bursting or breaking?
'Cause I don't see my heart getting strong

Tell your stories to me, show your bruises
Let's see what humanity is capable of handling
She lost her kid, only seven, to cancer
She answered with faith in her god and carried on, while

He was attacked by his son and was stabbed
In his stomach and his back and his arms, he showed me scars
82 years old, told me, "I still have my daughter and my wife
And I still have my life and my son"


Tell me what your worst fears are
I bet they look a lot like mine
Tell me what you think about
When you can't fall asleep at night

Tell me that you're struggling
Tell me that you're scared
No, tell me that you're terrified of life
Tell me that it's difficult
To not think of death sometimes

Tell me how you lost
Tell me how he left
Tell me how she left
Tell me how you lost everything that you had
Tell me it ain't ever coming back

Tell me about God
Tell me about love
Tell me that it's all of the above
Say you think of everything in fear
I bet you're not the only one who does

Everyone in the world comes at some point to suffering
I wonder when I will, I wonder
Everyone is out searching for someone or something
I wonder what I'll find, I wonder

Everyone in the world comes at some point to suffering
I wonder when I will, I wonder
Everyone is out searching for someone or something
I wonder what I'll find, I wonder

I wonder what I'll find, I wonder
I wonder what I'll find
I wonder what I'll find
I wonder what I'll find

An outcry
To lost dreams and the sense of wonder
To the streets that raised him, say goodbye
To the hope for the home he'd been holding
Say goodbye and be gone and be great

To the friends who left when they still could
For the ones who chose to stay
To waste away unplaced
Alone and pray
To get out, to grow old, to grow strong

And leave this city
So familiar
All its places
All these memories
Turn each day more to gray

More they space out till it's
Once a year we'll catch up
Maybe less
Or else just daydreams
While he's working late

Thinks only of those friends
And when they left
Are we still friends
At all, my friends?
Can I leave?

Rewind and find a younger man
All hopes and goals and dreams alight
And bright with friendship
At the crossroads in the night

"Now make a choice"
The city said
We were barely twenty then
But while I swore it my allegiance
They chose leaving, all my friends

And now it's letters
Maybe phone calls
That come less and less each year
All addressed with wives and children
To the fool who chose to stay here

And it hurts me to know I'm alone now
And it's worse when I know that I chose it
Don't make the same mistake as me
Don't make the same mistake

And now my friends have all left
Or it's been me gone all along?

I guess we all part one day
And drop like leaves into the breeze
And ain't it wild?
Ain't it bitter?
Didn't it carry you from me?

But it's the coping with my fear
That keeps me here, see, once it's gone
Do I regret you?
You can't retrieve it
Can I forget you?

I still believe
I might get left here
I might turn 63
Still sweeping up the gutters in the street
Or weeding concrete

Wait and see
We'll wait and see
Or rather, I will
Only me
Only me

Don't make the same mistake as me
Don't make the same mistake
Don't make the same mistake as me
Say goodbye and be gone and be great
And be done and be free

I heard the old man's voice break
Stutter once then stop it, I heard
A sentence started confidently
Halted by the sudden absence of a word

Stumbled and he sputtered, trying to find it back
Something once so simple gone now
When he finally gave up, told me
"Aw, it's like hell getting old"

When you came into the store
Did you know you'd show me your scars?

I had a heavy heart
He carried a door
It's shattered pane all wrapped in plastic
And he asked if I could fix it

Come by a little later
Help him put it back on hinges
"See, I'm far too old to lift it
And it's not for my house, it's my son's"

When you opened up the door
What is it you thought you'd find?

Nobody flinch

Later I came by
And backed into the driveway
Got out to find him waiting there
To lead me through the side yard

To back behind the house
Where the door frame stood empty and
Helped me keep it steady
While I hammered all the pins in

Then later on the porch
We somehow got to talking
He told me of the house
And how his son is schizophrenic

So they purchased it for him
The medication working
And they figured it would help him fit in
Help him lead a normal life

But the pills made him sleep too much
And he couldn't keep a job as a result
So one day he just gave up on taking them
And that day she had called you
He'd locked her outside of the house

How quickly did you get there?
And what were you thinking while walking up?
What fears flashed in front of you
Taunted you, walking to unlock the door?

I remember it, Ed
That story you told me
Came back clear tonight
Here while writing

And you should know the feeling never left me
The weight of my heart
When you showed me the scars
On your arms

When I looked in your eyes
And I heard what you'd said
How you'd probably would've died
Were it not for to care

For your daughter and wife
How he drove in the knife
Still your son
How you seemed to look through me

To some old projector screen
Playing back the scene as you
Described it on a movie reel
As real as the minute when it happened

That memory moving behind me
That moment that changed you for good

And he drove to the house
And pulled into the driveway
Got out to his wife
Waiting, frantic

She'd come by to check
Found the pillbox was empty
Went out to the pharmacy
To fill up his prescription

And came back to a locked door
And could not get back in
She'd knocked and she'd knocked
But he wasn't responding

You put the key into the lock
And turned it
Felt the bolt slide away
Slowly open

Went into the hall
His son held a knife
Standing off in the shadows
Lunged forward and tackled him

Stabbing him over and over
And breaking that window
He fled up the staircase
The ambulance came

Stitched and filled him with blood
While the cops took his son
With his wires so tangled
His father was a stranger

And I sit in my apartment
I'm getting no answers
I'm finding no peace
No release from the anger

I leave it at arms length
I'm keeping my distance
From hotels and Jesus
And blood on the carpet

I'm stomaching nothing
I'm reaching for no one
I'm leaving this city and
I'm headed out to nowhere

I carry your image
Your grandfather's coffin
And Ed, if you hear me
I think of you often

That's all I can offer
That's all that I know how to give

Like a shadow on a shadow
A phantom in a film strip
Faint glimmer of the past
Trapped in mother's old slides

Sits still in the apartment
While sifting through some pictures
Of the child that he once was
And the sense of hope they framed

"It's a shame"
And I fear that fate
While the humming from the street
Keeps me awake

He says, "I let life get twisted
Get worn out, torn up
And late with the rent
And now nothing makes sense

Except the bench and that piano
A feeling nearing order when I'm
Pressing down the chords"
And he plays

And it swells and breaks
But what'll it take to make
My life sound like that

And brings a fever
A dream of sweat and ecstasy
A kiss on every hammer hit
That follows as the keys fall

Down and bring an order first
Then chaos, then a calm
That paints every shift in
Murals on the wall

And it presses to your neck
It clutches to your hips
Softly sings to you of fireworks
And God and art and sex

And it's strange
That it feels so right
When nothing else does

But all the while he's playing
There's a humming coming up
And through the window from outside

And even he has to admit
A certain melody in it
But then, why can't he harmonize?

It's like the city's got its own song
But he can't play along
He sees the notes as they fly by
But always plays them wrong

And in the bathroom, it gets blurry
Gets warm and distorted
Like light pushed through the orange
Of the pillbox he poured in his palm

It falls to the floor
He smiles as it hits
Sounds a little like an instrument

Like a voice in the choir
That hum and that drumbeat
Of life as an art-form
And fire through the streets

That keep moving us in silence
To phantom baton sweeps
Keep tapping to the tempo of our feet

And all the ones
Who seem to fit
The best into the chorus
Never notice there's a song

And the ones who seem to hear it
End up tortured by the chords
When they fail to find
A way to sing along

And when you sing the wrong thing
It all starts collapsing
Starts to ring out and feedback
Starts lapsing and crashing

On notes that don't clash
But that never quite feel like they match
And I never quite feel like mine match

There's a melody in everything
I'm trying to find a harmony
But nothing seems to work
Nothing seems to fit

There's a melody in everything
I'm trying to find a harmony
But nothing seems to work
Nothing seems to fit

There's a melody in everything
I'm trying to find a harmony
But nothing seems to work
Nothing fits

Like any morning of my
Junior year
I stumble in the classroom
Late, but this day I see
Faces, I feel
An air like a funeral
Like a wake
As I sit down

Teacher speaking
Somewhat sombrely
But still confident and calm
Part eulogy
Her speech, and
Part poem, part celebration song

Her warmth and smile
She passes photocopies
Out to us of entries
From a journal
Kept so long ago
She starts to read
And suddenly
It's 1980

March 5
The cancer is furious
But our son is resilient
We have all the faith
We'll get through this
No matter what the end
Treatments are violent but
He keeps on smiling
It's amazing
Finding joy in the little things

April 12
Andrew's appetite's improved
And we thank God everyday
But still it's hard sometimes
To see him in that scarecrow frame

July 9
There's a suffering
When I look in his eyes
He's been through so much
We've all been through so much, but
What incredible resolve
Our little boy shows, only 7
Standing face to face with death
He said it's easy to find people
Who have suffered worse than him
"Like Jesus suffered worse than anyone"
He told me last night
"When God abandoned him", and

September 20
We've been playing in the yard
Lately his spirits are high
Although his blood counts aren't

October 14
He feels tired all the time

November 30
At the hospital again
It feels like home when we're here

December 8
He's getting worse...;

January 19
We buried our son today
Our youngest child
And while his death was ugly
We must not
Let it scare us from God
Abundant grace has restored him
A brand new body
And set him free from the torture
Finally rid of the cancer
Before the moment he left
He briefly wrested from death
Suddenly opened his eyes
Said, "I see everything"
"I see everything"

And I will never forget it
The peace and the comfort
You displayed through a pain
That I can only imagine

The loss of a child
To the torture of cancer
Help me

'Cause I can only imagine
How you recovered
Kept your faith
And held the brightness of life
Inside the smile of a child
You had to bury

And I will never forget him
Or your steadfast faith
No I will never forget you
Now six or seven years later

I'm devoid of all faith
I am empty of comfort
And I am weary of waiting
Though I've felt nowhere what you have
I see nothing at all
Though I've felt nowhere what he did
My eyes are closed

Another shooting on the south-east side
This a drive-by, mid-day
Outside of the bus stop
By Fuller and Franklin, or near there
Not far from the park
About a block from where
The other shooting was last month
Or was it last week?

Shots were fired from an SUV
Heading northbound, Eastown
The target, a rival
But they didn't hit the target this time
They hit a kid we think
Had nothing to do with it

And I travel backwards
Through time and space, and
I disintegrate, become invisible
I want to see it
Where I couldn't when it happened
I want to see it all
First hand this time
I want to know what it felt like

So I float behind police lines
Reconstruct the scene in fragments of memories
I want to know what his mother looked like up close
I want to see her leaning over his body
So I float there, transcend time
I want to capture it accurately
I want to know what the color of the blood was
Spilling out from the tarp onto the concrete

I want to write it all down
So I can always remember
If you could see it up close
How could you ever forget
How senseless death
How precious life
I want to be there
When the bullet hit


And the crowd poured out
As the shots drowned
Into siren sounds
Out of their houses now
And over front yards
All the way up to the place
Where the police tape ran
To mark the crime scene

Everybody trying to catch a glimpse
Of what was happening, of what was going on
Between the ambulance, and all the cop cars
Everybody gossiping, "Whose kid got hit?
Where'd it hit him, and who could've fired it?"
Everybody wondering, "How did it happen again?
And is he dead? These children, our kids"

Everybody wondering how far they were
From where the victims lived
And I visit them, their houses
Inside my dream I visit them
My spirit, soaring high and high
Up over King Park, leaves the crime scene
Travels further back, till far before the shooting
Through their windows, to their living rooms

I see them younger this time
Playing games and doing homework
All these marks of youth
Soon transformed coldly into stone
For fights and stupid feuds
For ruins wrapped in gold, and

Cruelly, I recall
Why I have come
To find a reason
But there cannot be a reason
Not for death, not like this
Not like this


Three days later, they made funeral plans
The family
Three days later, a mother
Had to bury her son


Not far away, the shooter
Holed up in a hotel
Near to the highway
With a friend and the gun
That same gun

He'd fled immediately
But was identified by witnesses
His picture on TV
Only 20 years old; they called him Grandpa
He was older than the others
By a year, maybe two, and
He was safe for awhile
Until somebody saw him there


And notified the authorities
Who surrounded the hotel
First arresting an accomplice
While attempting to flee
Then chasing him up the staircase
To the floor where he'd stayed
He closed the door hard behind him
Locked himself in the room

They could've kicked in the door
But knew the gun was still with him
One he'd already used
And so they feared what he'd do
I floated up through the window
Of a room to the west
I hovered out to the hallway
Tried to listen in

I heard them trying to reason
Get him to open the door
His uncle begging and pleading
Half-collapsed to the floor
He preached of hope and forgiveness
Said, "There is always a chance
To rectify what you've taken
Make your peace in the world"

I thought to slip through the door
I could've entered the room
I felt the burden of murder
It shook the earth to the core
Felt like the world was collapsing
Then we heard him speak

"Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
Can I ever be forgiven cause I killed that kid?
It was an accident, I swear it wasn't meant for him!

And if I turn it on me, if I even it out
Can I still get in or will they send me to hell?
Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?"
I left the hotel behind, don't want to know how it ends

Stained-glass and the choir sing out
That strong and ceaseless chorus here
So sweet the voices, sweep like
Leaves into the street, on Easter
A celebration, carried on
For God and hope and refuge
To keep each other, life
Give shelter from the storm (And keep warm)

The congregation gathers
Outside in the parking lot
Each service done, they keep the old hymn
Rolling on and on, and
I see the scene in color each day
Driving out to Eastown
That old abandoned church
And have I gone the same sad way?

Have I gone the same sad way?

Through the sixties flourished
And the seventies did flux
The eighties fluctuate each year
Unclear when the money would dry up
And when the nineties
Violent crime and rising
Unemployment rates came by
That parking lot grew dim and thin
Of sinners and saints

Until the voices
Unceasing, slowly faded to black
Until the weeds stormed the concrete
From unattended cracks
It had to know, had to feel that glory
Never coming back
Like I could feel it when the passion left
The last of what I had
It had to know

Like I knew
And I can't find it back
Might not ever

Ten years now, standing vacant
Ten years on empty, maybe more
Once held the faith of hundreds
Soon one more cell phone store

For years, they gathered here
Inside the building, sound and true
To sing their praises to a god
That gave them hope, to carry on
To carry through

So I've been thinking about that
Sometimes go slow when I drive by
How a home of stone and a house so holy
Grows so empty over time

What gave those people purpose
Past death approaching constantly
Now left to crumble slowly
Now left to wither with the weeds

Now left to ice and vandals
The advent candles long since gone
The old foundation shifting hard
The concrete overgrown, but

That stained-glass window
Sits untouched amongst the brickwork worn
A symbol of the beauty
Only perfect at that moment we were born

And just the other day
I swear I saw a man there
Pulling weeds out of the concrete
Sweeping up and patching cracks

I saw him lift a rag to
Wash the years of
Filth from off those windows
Made me wonder if there's
Anyone like that
For you and me
And anybody else
Who broke and lost hope

After sundown, before sleeping
I am the worst of me
I am a mess of these
Old themes and the murmur of half-dreams
Whisper seductively
And stage scenes, it's

Fear fiction, these visions
Caught somewhere between delusion and prophesy
What I haven't done
What I've wanted to
And what I fear you have
Becomes reality here

Bright lights in the young night
Keep to the beat
A classic party scene
Crowded and interesting
No love, no life, no history
Just touch, just chemistry, just

A roaring undercurrent
Simple and sensory
Young bodies, warm skin
Perfect symmetry and
It's a moment
Harmless; it's energy

It's like medicine
It's self-discovery, see
All the secrets I keep
Why are they secrets?

It's only temporary
That fleeting feeling of warmth
Just a flash before the line gets blurry
Between a longing for more
Than what the body wants now and
What the body wants now more than anything?

Was it integrity
That kept my hands to myself
Or just the thought of getting
Too far ahead of you?
Was it that I got too tired of the consequence?
Or was I just scared?

I only know I never wanted to get left behind
No pauses, not a second guess
First a swaying, then a stumble, then a swagger
They're just movements
Towards feeling
It doesn't matter, neither hesitates to carry on

A kind of energy, sweat and block out everything to
Find every aperture and compel the animal parts
Fan flames, taste fruit, taste bitter fruit
Just trying to learn how all the wires in the body work
Just trying to feel it out, it's like medicine
Find the healing in whatever bed they end up in

I want to feel it out
I want to know how it works
I want to know if it was worth it to worry
About the ghosts I feared
Would haunt the memory
About the damage that I'm sure the fear has done to me now

I want to know what it is
In me that won't follow through
Those nights the instinct
Takes a hold of me and pushes too
Maybe it's only that I've never gotten over you
Or am I still scared?

I see the church steps
A vision
Is there fiction in this one too? It's true
I've made a tale of it here
Still it's a little unclear
Who's been haunting who

And time can
Be such a funny thing
Always moving to the future
Glorifying the past
And amplifying the pain
In frames of glass

So was our touch half as sacred as I've made it seem
Or just another fabrication of a half-dream?
Just those chemicals, the adolescent love
Just us trying to grasp onto meaning

Onto a purpose
Onto a sense that
Something spiritual releases when the feeling hits
And when the feeling hits

And in that moment, sparks and harps play out
A sweeping melody through fog and fantasy
And in that moment there's an honesty instinctive and pure
But it departs like it came
Rapid and bearing no more
Than fleeting ecstasy of natural harmony

They fear the notes being played
And try to sing along
Don't be ashamed, be free to the feeling
Don't be ashamed, keep feeling
But find it, a body that makes sense
I've felt it

What will I find?
Some sacred thing
To help me handle the tragedy?
Or did I once
Did I have it and lose it?

No one should ever have to walk through the fire alone
No one should ever have to brave that storm, no
Everybody
Needs someone or something

And when I sing
Don't I sing your name out
Right at the same time
That I sing my own?

Some days, I swear I can feel you
Splitting the light through the window frame
The shapes it makes
Are always warmer, always brighter
Than the rest of what comes through

Some days, I swear I can hear you sing
To me, or whisper my name in the slightest way
It's like the warmest light now laid across my bedroom floor
Is somehow actually you
And not just sunlight

I have the memory, climb down the balcony
I put a flower on the back of its dress, it's
Probably best to forget it
It's probably best to let go

I paint it the shade of where the skin and the lip meet
Only a moment after breaking the kiss, and
I blur out everything else
That's how I choose to remember it

Some nights are a lot like the days, I lay awake too late
I watch the shadows cast and trace your shape
Those silver slivers on the wall, then on the bedsheets
I hear your song in the trees
I finally fall into rest

Often later when I'm sleeping you show up in my dreams
Just doing simple things, like buying groceries, and
When I wake up, I could swear you must've just left me
Like you got up to get breakfast
Or maybe just to get dressed

But the truth is
You were never there, you won't ever be
Sometimes I think I'm not either
So what do I do
When every day still seems to start and end with you?

And you won't ever know
You won't ever see
How much your ghost since then
Has been defining me

I leave the memory up atop the balcony
I tear this flower from the back of the dress
It's best this time, I bet
To just forget and let go

Paint it the shade of where the lip bleeds and blur it out
I blur out everything else
Just blur out everything else
And let go, and let go, and let go

Everybody has to let go someday
Everybody has to let go
I wonder when I will, I wonder

But if I still hear you singing in every city I'm in
After I blur it all out, our every memory, if
You never fade with the days, your shape still haunting me then
Should I not just sing along?
Should I not just sing along?

I will sing sweetly
Hope that the notes change but
I do not need it to happen
I'm not resigned to it

And if they never do
I'll sing your name in every line
Just like I did throughout this
Just like I've always done

In every gun, the empty church
And every tortured son
In all those giving up
In all those giving in

Until I die I will sing our names in unison
Until I die I will sing our names in unison
Until I die, until I

We killed a lot of innocent civilians.
To us every civilian in Baghdad was a terrorist.
They said "they are now in civilian clothes" that makes everybody free game,
But if they came in our perimeter, we lit 'em up.
And when we would pull the body out, and when we would search the car, we would find nothing.
This took place time and time again. No harm, no foul, that's okay, don't worry about it,
Because this is a new type of war, this is an eradication.

I honestly feel we're committing genocide over here,
I don't believe in killing civilians, and I'm not going to kill civilians for the United States Marine Corps.

All of this comes crashing down
Cornerstone's gone
Sleepless
Hopeless
No end in sight

Ink well
Has run dry
Fill it with
Blood of the scribe

Rest comes easy to the guiltless...
The vampire laments as he prays for the sun.
Doom, despair, tragedy are the tools of the trade

Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste

Frayed at the edge, flat lined
The anvil cracks, the hammer
Relentlessly comes down
A new pariah is born

Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste

Chastisement lays you down to sleep
Tucks you in with bloody kisses
Gifts of nightmares bitter sweet

Type A negative shuts me down
Catch phrase will be death of me
Is this not what you came to see?
What, are you not entertained?

Climb the walls 'til nails bleed
Rip the hair, tear the seams
Break the glass, head in hands
Bell tolls endlessly, no end in sight

Endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
Whipping the nightmares to a froth
Endless questions with no answers
No replacement for what's been lost
Lost

Everything suffocates in the dust of past
Fortunes squandered
The empire of lies to whom you pandered

Suffer a self-imposed exile
Taste the bitter fruits of denial
In the presence of greatness
The humble can only bow

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of eternal winter

Tell me a lie with the best of intentions
Mute in the age of mass communication
Dark days lead to darker nights
Frozen, out of time
It dies for blessed ego
The once mighty laid low

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

You taught me hate
I'll teach you fear
Open the eyes
Kill despair

Blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision
The day we all fell still
Rapture of the dying age
A shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass
It's only getting worse
Not worth a moments regret
Each dawn another curse
Every breath a twisting blade
What will be left behind in the ashes of the wake

An ill wind blows this way
The edge of the envelope burns
Forbearance and my vengeance
Payment for your intent
Fear and death in the wings
In thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does
Witness the mass disgrace
God forbid you read the signs
Watch for meanings between the lines

Gehenna has now arrived
No hindsight for the blind
Your trust has been misplaced
Believed the lies told to your face
Became another casualty and now it's too late
You finally made it home
Draped in the flag that you fell for
And so it goes
The ashes of the wake
Its only getting worse

If there was a single day I could live
A single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away

The blood's on the wall
So you might as well just admit it
And bleach out the stains
Commit to forgetting it

You're better off empty and blank
Than left with a single pathetic trace of this
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself
See who gives a fuck

Absorb yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself

I'll chain you to the truth
For the truth shall set you free
I'll turn the screws of vengeance
And bury you with honesty

I'll make all your dreams come to life
Then slay them as quickly as they came
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself
See who gives a fuck

Absorb yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself

See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck

If there was a single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away

Now you've got something to die for

Infidel
Imperial
Lust for blood
A blind crusade
Apocalyptic
We count the days

Bombs to set the people free
Blood to feed the dollar tree
Flags for coffins on the screen
Oil for the machine
Army of liberation
Gunpoint indoctrination
The fires of sedition
Fulfill the prophecy

Now you've got something to die for

Send the children to the fire
Sons and daughters stack the pyre
Stoke the flame of the empire
Live to lie another day
Face of hypocrisy
Raping democracy
Apocalyptic
We count the days

We'll never get out of this hole
Until we've dug our own grave
And drug the rest down with us
The burning home of the brave
Burn

Now you've got something to die for

Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward.
Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both.
For a wounded man shall say to his assailant: "If I live, I will kill you. If I die, you are forgiven."
Such is the Rule of Honor.

Broken the paradigm
An example must be set
Invoke the siren song and sign the death warrant
This is what has been wrought for thirty pieces of silver
The tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer

I am the result what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking
I've been all ears

Words meant to dwell in darkness shall never see the light of day
Words can be broken, so can bones
Execute the mandate
Mouth full of dirt, your name is removed from the registry
St. Peter greets with empty eyes, then turns and locks the gate

I am the result what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking
I've been all ears

Omerta

Cheaply venal, stupidly verbose
A slip of the tongue, a slit of the throat
Six feet under with no marker
Keep my name from your mouth forever
Free speech for the living
Dead men tell no tales
Your laughing finger will never point again

Omerta

Sing for me now

The sins of deliverance

The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope
It's when murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one-gun salute for the new independence day
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your sacrifice

The sins of deliverance

"So let the wicked perish in the presence of God"
For your sacrifice

The sins of the father atoned by the son
Confessions of commitments broken
A nail driven for every one
It's when murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one-gun salute for the new independence day
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your sacrifice

You are the cause, I am the effect
Created in hatred, a noose for your neck

The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope
They'll hallow your name for your sacrifice
They'll hallow your name
Sacrifice...
Sacrifice...
Sacrifice...
They'll hallow your name

The dirty lord of the manor surveys his filthy domain
Too many nights raising hell worked a little all too well
Constructed a monument to denial and excess
Sunk so low, crawled so far back there's nowhere left to regress
If these walls could talk, they would tell a horror story
Never-ending winter, violence and infidelity
Shadows fall through broken panes
Careless words that are filled with hate
Just enough to keep it together, never enough to make it work
All the tongues here are forked
We are a hailstorm of broken glass
Follow the path of least expectance

A huge stinking pile of sick

Pile it higher and higher
Light the match, start the fire
Level this place until nothing's left and take us with it

Surroundings are irate
Crack of dawn brings naught but pain
Resentment steadily grows, laughing in the gallows

Full throttle determined to fail
Pedal to the metal asleep at the wheel
We are the lucky ones, welcome home

Pile it higher and higher
Light the match, start the fire
Level this place until nothings left and take us with it

Poisoned nerves and a bloody antidote
Violence is not an aberration, it's a rule
Dying beyond the pale
Your beatings will continue until my morale improves
I don't hate you, I'm just removing an enemy
Remorse is for the dead

I'm just removing an enemy
Remorse is for the dead, my enemy
Remorse is for the dead

Witness shame's parade
The pain of blame repaid
It's fucking hopeless
Accusations and denial

Hopeless
Demon of another day
Colorless
Stoned
Solid gray

Emptiness
Of promises I made
So faithless
The tenants long betrayed

Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Silence
The only promise ever kept

Familiar touch
A ritual to numb the cut
Salvation in vice
Anguish is realizing what could have been
But never was
It's emptiness that fills the cup
Devotion in the method of my fall

Pointless
Futility continuing
Endless
Flowing in corrupted vein

Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Silence
The only promise ever kept
It's fucking hopeless

Hopeless

Blank stares from broken men
So withered from the poisons
They can't remember when
There were once honest reasons
It's all a lie, it died a hundred thousands miles ago
Pretending I'm still here

Justify
What I've become
Sanctify
What I've become

Amazing disgrace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Better lost if this is found
Best blinded, never to see

The race to save face
Nothing now is what
We meant it to be
Pretending I'm still here

It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal

Justify
What I've become
Sanctify
What I've become

Suffered consequence
It's been so long since any piece of this made any kind of sense
You anoint the king, I'll burn everything down to ashes
You giveth, I taketh away
You giveth, I taketh away

It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like, to be hated
To be fated, to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you (you, you, you)
No one bites back as hard, on their anger
None of my pain and woe, can show through (through, through, through)

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover

No one knows what it's like, to be mistreated
To be defeated, behind blue eyes (blue eyes, blue eyes, blue eyes)
And no one knows how to say, that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not telling lies (lies, lies)

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes

I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give life to the moon
Assuming the moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors and then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest.

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head.

Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do
And run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone.

I'm so sick of the tension (Ahh)
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this (Ahh)
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension (Ahh)
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this (Ahh)
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head.

You try to take the best of me, go away.
You try to take the best of me, go away.
You try to take the best of me, go away.
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head.

Stay away!

I am so sick of the tension (Stay)
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
(A-) Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest.

I'm so sick of the tension (Way)
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself

(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blind leaves you senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
And if I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself

(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid, I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

Don't you (Know?)
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)
I can't seem to convince myself (Why)
I'm stuck on the outside

Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real, oh

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence)
(I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (Distracting), reacting
Against my will I'll stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
It's haunting (It's haunting) how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

There's a place so dark, you can't see the end
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut
Looking through the rust and rot n' dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind street lamps
Chain link and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

I've been diggin' into crates ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat-race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords in double helixes and show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness and all of you MCs who hate us
So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones
I fire-bomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin' bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon Technicolor type A
On highways ride with road rage
Pages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings
Overall the same thing
Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with the pencil-pistol, official 16-line the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' "rah blah blah blah"

(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (Far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge, I'm about to break)

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break)

Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that I watch every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall (And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall (And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun)
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
(I feel the light betray me)

(The sun)
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

 (I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride, is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in

I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away

I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true
Now I find myself in question (They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association (You point the finger at me again)

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth, instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action these words were never true
Now I find myself in question (They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association (You point the finger at me again)

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth, instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
E-even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

It's true the way I feel was promised by your face
The sound of your voice painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you

You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant
And I can't bring you back

It's true the way I feel was promised by your face
The sound of your voice painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you

You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No!
No matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come, I
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you

You, now I see
Keeping everything inside

Even when I close my eyes

Memories consume like opening the wounds
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way; I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know
Somehow I need you to go

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know
Somehow I need to be alone

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away with no apologies

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Something has been taken from deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away, no one can ever see
Wounds so deep, they never show, they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years, they've played

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending, I don't feel misplaced
It's so much simpler than change

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

It's easier to run
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made

It's easier to go
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
A handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored

I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
Because you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
For once just to hear me out

So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here because you're all that I got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored

No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored

Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It's like nothing I could do would distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
Because from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize, instead of setting it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away, never goes away

And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

Hearing your name the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing' myself to them and every day
I regret saying those things because now I see
That I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away, never goes away

And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

It never goes away, it never goes away
It never goes away, it never goes away

Get away from me
Give me my space back, you got to just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you know
I've let you go
So get away from me
Give me my space back, you got to just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you know
I've let you go

And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you
I've let myself become you, I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

I don't know who to trust, no surprise
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

Tension is building inside, steadily
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Heavy thoughts forcing their way, out of me

Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

I won't waste myself on you, you, you
Waste myself on you, you, you

I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away

I won't trust myself with you, you, you

There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think having the upper hand means you've gotta keep putting me down
But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting util the upper hand is mine

One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone

So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall and I'm counting down the time
'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone
And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone

I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone
And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone

When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can
But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from you

(No, no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own because I can see
(Naw, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in
And now you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth
The more I push, the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm lying my way from you

(No, no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside, so let me go

Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

Coming at you

Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like, rewind that
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those
Who want to talk this and that so I suppose
That it gets to a point feelings got to get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, it goes

I try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that its better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it just like you

I try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, heart full of pain

I try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nobody's listening
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Nobody's listening

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly; afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Name  Numb
Artist  Linkin Park
Album  Meteora
(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything till I break away from me
I will break away; I'll find myself today

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

(I want to heal, I want to feel like I'm)
Somewhere I belong
(I want to heal, I want to feel like I'm)
Somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong

Album  Meteora
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Wake in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused, but I'm scared
I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help, somehow, somewhere
And no one cares

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!

Album  Minutes To Midnight
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say somethin'
Lightweights step it aside when we comin'
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumpin'
People on the street they panic and start runnin'

Words on loose leaf sheet, complete comin'
I jump on my mind, I summon the rhyme I'm dumpin'
Healin' the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin'

Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin'
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumpin'
Risk somethin', take back what's yours
Say somethin' that you know they might attack you for

'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I had before
Like it's stupid standin' for what I'm standin' for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor

Like they understand you, in the back of their jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
And these fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank, and cashin' their cheque
Askin' you to have compassion and have some respect

For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
In the living room laughin' like, "What did he say?"

(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)

In my livin' room watchin', but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react to get blown into fractions

Ten years old, it's somethin' to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'

Do you see the soldiers they're out today
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday

There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show

My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back he hand-wrote a quote inside
"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like "What did he say?"

(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between

Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between

Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none

And I cannot explain to you

Fear is not afraid of you
But guilt's a language you can understand
I cannot explain to you
In anything I say or do
But hope the actions speak the words they can

For my pride and my promise
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way

I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
'Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?
So if you're asking me I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shed what I made
I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you
So if you're asking me I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

Do you tell yourself I don't realize?
Your crusade's a disguise,
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives
I'm aware of what you've done

No, no more sorrow!
I've paid for your mistakes!
Your time is borrowed!
Your time has come to be replaced!

I see pain, I see need,
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed,
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived
You will pay for what you've done!

No, no more sorrow!

I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, o-o-oh

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, o-o-oh

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain, like an ocean everywhere

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away as a nation simply stares

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground, now I
Now I do

My insides all turned to ash
So slow
And blew away as I collapsed
So cold
A black wind took them away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

I used to be my own protection
But not now
'Cause my path has lost direction
Somehow
A black wind took you away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

So now you're gone
And I was wrong
I never knew what it was like
To be alone

On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day

On a Valentine's day

In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I'll start again and whatever pain may come
Today this ends, I'm forgiving what I've done

Name  Now We Are Free

Album  Gladiator - Music From The Motion Picture
I met a shell of a mountain who knew she was finished
Claimed she grew up from a grain of sand
With every year wider she bloomed a little bit longer
To the roof of the sky with outstretched hands
She made friends with the sun, shared enemies with no one
Counted weeks like she should of counted days
And swallowed handfuls of night so she could sleep tight
And turn her thoughts from its stone cold ways

And this was the beginning, the start of the ending
You can't die from a broken heart
But from the time the sun rose
To the space where it fell away
She would love, and it wouldn't take part
And every every day she would echo echo
In every single way she should let go let go
But it had her in its sights cupids icy arrows
But so, so what

So she caught every one with her heart like it was her duty
It walked the wrong wrong way down her one way plan
She was surrounded by forests, rivers and beauty
Until that glacier froze over the land
And so she blamed herself hated her wealth
She was born at too young of an age
And every night her dreams were touched by witches fingers
Until her heart was caged.
With every morning spent not caring if she cares or not
Sleeping in the melt and mud, waiting for the earth to rot
Burying herself alive she scrapes the hole that it left open
Empty as her very heart, that mountain was all broken
All broken, that mountain was all broken

Now I can see that her
Her blood's red and she's got feelings
And they always get spilled both without thinking
Without thinking, without thinking,
Without thinking, I can see that her

Her blood's red and she's got feelings
And they always get spilled both without thinking
Without thinking, they weren't thinking,
Without thinking, I can see that her

Her blood's red and she's got feelings
And they always get spilled both without thinking
Without thinking, I wasn't thinking,
Without thinking, I can see that our

Our blood's red and we got feelings
And we always spill both bloods without thinking
Without thinking, what were we thinking,
We weren't thinking, what were we thinking of

And they say that I'm crazy,
They just can't see what you mean to me
All I need is to be with you

Now that you're gone, just can't move on
For 62 years, I've loved you, my dear.
And I miss you something terrible, this heartache's unbearable
Why'd you go and leave me? I want you back, my sweet pea

I can't wear that same suit, out on the town without you
Waiting to find that same look in her eyes
I found a new honey,
But she'll never mean what you meant to me
You still are all of me.

The trees will all burn, ash falls like leaves.
The storm's growing cold, we can feel it in our knees.
They'll plan when you're calm or they'll scheme while you sleep.
They'll look you in the eyes while they chain your hands and feet.
Yeah they will

Watch out behind, trouble's coming.
Look up ahead, start running.
Look out behind, trouble's coming.
Watch up ahead, start running.

Watch out behind, trouble's coming.
Look up ahead, start running.
Watch out behind, trouble's coming.
Look up ahead, start running.
Watch out behind, trouble's coming.
Watch up ahead, start running.
Look out behind, trouble's coming.

Life sucks and I never tried suicide
Minds fucked even more than I realise
Times up keep it moving when she arrives
If you ever heard what I heard in my mind
Never try
You would cry
Thats a lie
You would die
I don’t ever wanna come down from a high
Im in the best seat
From time been a next breed
If your coming come at me directly
Don’t need no-one to defend me
Souls in a place even I can’t get to
Don’t fuck with the deadly
Moon waves and open seas
Quick coasting over seas
Fuck those who don’t believe
They will never wanna admit I’m the best here
For the mere fact that I’ve got ovaries
Its a woman world so to speak
Pussy you sour
Never giving credit where its due cos you don’t like pussy in power
Venom
Venom

My my if you ever heard what I heard in the night
What a fright
Must’ve been a parasite in my past life
I don’t ever wanna come down from a high
My soul ascended to the sky
Its just you and I
Gone but I’m feeling too alive
Tryna get me outta spite
Someones gotta pay I ain’t talking big amounts
Some kinda physical pain
Some kinda traumatic shit
Niggas wanna see dead bodies probably not they ain’t rolling with no automatic clips
Moving scatty all erratic and shit
Niggas pussy licking batty and shit
Oh you mad? Then come at me you prick
Make a move better pattern it quick
I assume you’ll be coming for blood
That makes 2 of us that makes 2 of us

Night time to daylight we roll trees
Saves live invade minds and go deep
Oh he wouldn’t of guessed I’m so chill
Part of the day in the life you won’t see
Part of the day in the life you can’t be here for
Its the day in the life of OG’s
Dealing with inner demons that won’t leave
No a word you will listen when my soul speaks
Down I go
So follow me follow me follow me
Actually don’t follow me
Nobody bother me
Im a mess honestly
Fuck all your policies
They wanna kick me down a demolish me
Use me and fucking abolish me
I don’t wanna hear no apologies
Or am I in my own head?
Can’t tell anymore psychotic to the death
When I dig deep I can never find nothing left
Its a mystery
Rage
Nothing but rage
Can’t figure out if I’m going insane
Aint’ no doubt we’ll be showing no mercy so think twice if you wanna get blazed
Nothing ain’t nice round here no games
I don’t wanna dark nobody in a flash
True its a stick up
Hands in the air
Put the money in bag all cash all cash

Strange days not like before
2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before

It's the turn of the century
New Year's Eve of '99
And we're all anticipating
What could happen overnight
It's a crazy situation
Gotta find myself a man
Who can lead me to temptation
And take me by the hand

Turn my dreams into the real thing, baby
Turn my dreams into the real thing

2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before
2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before

Our bodies all entangled
In a grip of ecstasy
When eleven turns to midnight
I'm gonna feel that lovin' heat
I want to feel the good vibrations
That you put inside my head
Let's return this for the last time
On this bed

Turn my dreams into the real thing, baby
Turn my dreams into the real thing

Weit von hier, jenseits des Fichtenwaldes liegt ein kleiner Garten. Dort singt die Nachtigall die ganze Nacht hindurch. Der kalte kristallene Mond schaut hernieder, die Eibe spreizt ihre riesigen Arme über die Schläfer.

Der Tod muss so schön sein, in weicher brauner Erde zu liegen, wogendes Gras über dem Haupt und der Stille zu lauschen.
Der Tod muss so schön sein. Kein gestern mehr, kein morgen. Zeit, vergessen. Leben, vergessen. In Frieden sein.

This is the room where crime scene stays,
The burning black book of fear tore out a page,
This is a house where a crime scene's staged

One of these days we'll be walking in the sun
Some simple day that has not yet begun
And one of the visions the Devil got away
And one of these dreams the dead didn't stay

This is a house where crime scene's staged

For clear space and soundess of mind
I've let you play me for some time
One can only receive and retain
But the lies you recite for your gain

So you rely on my faith in your kind
Or rather continue to pretend that I'm blind
You say I made your life a living hell
And yet still let me pay you when I fell

How is it you're feeling so uneasy?
How is it that I feel fine?
Life reveals what is dealt through seasons
Circle comes around each time

I've been blessed with eyes to see this
Behind the unwhole truth you hide
Bite to remind the bitten, bigger
Mouth repaying tenfold wide

I'm above
Over you I'm standing above
Claiming unconditional love

Try to keep bad blood in the past
Never thought a chance, a chance it would last
I have strength enough, enough to forgive
I desire peace where I live

How he'd wished that they would wed
"I promise on our love" she said
Promises were never kept
Alone on dirty floor he slept

And although he'd not accept
She was gone and so he wept
Then a demon came to him
"You must know I'm gonna win"

Blood on the wheels where the rust don’t stain
Your self-chosen cure is your self-chosen pain

No time to ride on the back of a beast such as suicide
Johnny, come lately,
The black light suits you baby

Too sweet, it’s there for the killing
Lyin' there at your feet, but the face in the mirror's grown older
A bell’s distant ringin', the scorpion stingin'
Wheel's making noise, but your mind don’t care
The world's screaming in like you're not even there

You slide, inside
To the back of a train they call "suicide"

You know the black light suits you baby

Time to time the skies come down

The wind has carried all of that away

Laugh at tiny holes
Buy and trade men's souls

Worth no more than pennies

Have been fair, I thought
May you never free
You from you or me

You turned your back and proved you're fake

No hesitation, no turning back

If I don't rat I'll never get out
I know nothing, that's not
what I'm about
You locked me up an innocent man
Because I got some pride
I got some pride

Can't you see what you're
doin' to me
Locked me down when I should be free
I've done no wrong
I'm an innocent man
You don't give a fuck
You'll never understand

I see it every day
Everywhere I look they say
Another life has been taken away
It makes my stomach turn
But livin' here you gotta learn
Get used to it, it's reality

Say your prayers
Hope it won't happen to you
Mind you business
Do what you gotta do
Don't look for trouble
Sometimes trouble finds you
What can you do, what can I do?

One on one fights don't exist
Fist fights are extinct
Nowadays people don't seem to think
They can't see how easy
It is to set a soul free
That decision is not theirs to make

Say your prayers
Hope it won't happen to you
Mind you business
Do what you gotta do
Don't look for trouble
Sometimes trouble finds you
What can you do, what can I do?

Now you see what I mean
Protecting my family and me
What can I do?

It makes my stomach turn
But livin' here you gotta learn
You gotta fight back when someone
Tries to take your life from you

We don't fake it
We just take it

Set it off

I see through bitter eyes
And the fact still remains
I read between your lies
You got beat at your own game

Take a trip with me
For soon I will sin
Without one regret
The pain will begin

As the knife got deeper
I won't go without a fight
But you know the price you'll pay
That price is with your life

Suffering and pain
Like nothing in your past
I walk the walk
And my path will be your last

I see through bitter eyes
And the fact still remains
I read between your lies
You got beat at your own game

Take a trip with me
For soon I will sin
Without one regret
The pain will begin

As the knife got deeper
I won't go without a fight
But you know the price you'll pay

Suffering and pain

I walk the walk
And my path will be your last

The path will be your fucking last

Weil die Welt sich so schnell dreht
Weil die Zeit so schnell vergeht
Kommst Du nicht hinterher
Weil die Hektik sich nicht legt
Und Du in der Masse untergehst
Bist du ein Tropfen im Meer

Doch Du lebst länger als ein Leben lang
Du bist das womit alles begann

Denn Du schreibst Geschichte
Mit jedem Schritt
Mit jedem Wort
Setzt Du sie fort
Du schreibst Geschichte
An jedem Tag
Denn jetzt und hier
Bist du ein Teil von ihr

Weil ein Monster vor dir steht
Und die bedrohlich in die Augen sieht
Bist Du lieber still
Weil jeder Dir erzählt
Wer Du bist und was Dir fehlt
Vergisst Du, was Du sagen willst

Doch Du lebst länger als ein Leben lang
Du bist das womit alles begann

Denn Du schreibst Geschichte
Mit jedem Schritt
Mit jedem Wort
Setzt Du sie fort
Du schreibst Geschichte
An jedem Tag
Denn jetzt und hier
Bist du ein Teil von ihr

Weil du nur einmal lebst
Willst du, dass sich was bewegt
Bevor du gehst
Bevor du gehst

Du lebst länger als ein Leben lang
Du bist das womit alles begann

Denn Du schreibst Geschichte
Mit jedem Schritt
Mit jedem Wort
Setzt Du sie fort
Du schreibst Geschichte
An jedem Tag
Denn jetzt und hier
Bist du ein Teil von ihr

[This is the last night of the world?]

(People of the Earth,
you are reconciled that this
is the last night of the world.)

This is it, we stand alone
We can see it all from here

The starless night across the mountainside
There's no one left to talk to
There's nothing left to say

Into the valleys the shadow of death
Grieves silently across the darkened sea

(As the end draws near)
You and me, we stand alone
We can see it all from here

Stretched far and wide
The barren skies
Fighting silence
Deep inside

Into the valleys, the shadow of death
Grieves silently across the darkened sea

(People of the Earth,
you are reconciled
that this is the last night of the world.)
[This is the last night of the world?]

(As the end draws near)

You and me, we stand alone
We can see it all from here

Grieves silently, it's in you and me

Oh ich liebe die Gefahr, ich war ihr nie ausgesetzt
Und egal wie es war, jede Zeit hat ihre Pest
Für ein bisschen anders sein verkauf ich Haus und Hof
Werd' leider meine Herkunft so aber auch nicht los
Die gefährliche Herkunft, so normal wie gewöhnlich
Und wenn Papa alles zahlt bin ich in meinem Viertel König
Deshalb zauber ich schnell noch Sorgen aus dem Hut
Ich bin kein Van Gogh, meinen Ohren geht es gut
Ich bin irgendwie links, aber das ist mir egal
Wichtig ist immer nur das Unterscheidungsmerkmal
Sind alle gegen Banken, bin ich dafür
Die ganze Welt am Zanken, aber nicht mit mir
Denn so sehr man auch sucht man findet keine Überzeugung
Denn der Oberflächen-Punk verleiht allem Bedeutung
Das ein bisschen Andersartigkeit verspricht
Für ein bisschen Überlegen fühlen können
Oder eben nicht

Immer ganz weit vorne
(Oder eben nicht)
Überlegen fühlen können
(Oder eben nicht)
Anders als all die anderen
(Oder eben nicht)
Und ich denk was ich sag
Doch im Leben nicht
(Doch im Leben nicht)
Oder nicht?
(Oder nicht?)

Kein Standpunkt hält
(Oder eben nicht)
Der Wandlung selbst
(Oder eben nicht)
Anders als all die anderen
(Oder eben nicht)
Und ich glaub was ich denk
Ja im Leben nicht
(Doch im Leben nicht)
Oder nicht?
(Oder nicht?)

Halb hip, doppelt doof, Hip Hip Hurra
Die Werber drehen durch, alle Träume wurden wahr
Sie verkaufen die Scheiße mit den härtesten Rebellen
Und die Schlauen lachen leise an den traurigen Stellen
All die traurigen Stellen, weil es so anders erdacht war
In den seltenen Fällen wo man wirklich gedacht hat
Dass man vielleicht doch einen Unterschied machen kann
Die Haltung bewahren und über Schwachsinn lachen kann
Die Zeiten sind durch, weg, vorbei, so restlos vorüber
Diese feinen Unterschiede kommen so nie wieder
Und die Kids sind nur einen Mausklick weit entfernt
Von der Wahrheit in all diesem heißen Lärm
Von der Wahrheit oder dem was sie dafür halten
Diese Wahrheit dreht durch, willst du sie behalten?
Und die Haltungen fallen wie dumme Dominosteine
Ich bin nicht wirklich erschüttert, ich hatte sowieso keine
Denn ich muss immer alles schlechter finden als es ist
Und immer schlauer sein als ich leider wirklich bin
Weil es manchmal vorkommt, dass man fast vergisst
Dass man anders ist, weil alle anders sind

Immer ganz weit vorne
Überlegen fühlen können
Anders als all die anderen
Und ich denk was ich sag
Doch im Leben nicht
Oder nicht

Kein Standpunkt hält
(Oder eben nicht)
Der Wandlung selbst
(Oder eben nicht)
Anders als all die anderen
(Oder eben nicht)
Und ich glaub was ich denk
Ja im Leben nicht
(Doch im Leben nicht)

Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
Come with us and you will see
This, our town of Halloween

This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene
Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright

It's our town, everybody scream
In this town of Halloween
I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red

I am the one hiding under your stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween

In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise

'Round that corner, man hiding in the trash can
Something's waiting to pounce and how you'll
Scream! This is Halloween
Red 'n' black, slimy green
Aren't you scared? Well, that's just fine

Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream, everybody scream
In our town of Halloween

I am the clown with the tear-away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the "who" when you call, "Who's there?"
I am the wind blowing through your hair

I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
'alloween, 'alloween
'alloween, 'alloween

Tender lumplings everywhere
Life's no fun without a good scare
That's our job, but we're not mean
In our town of Halloween

In this town, don't we love it now?
Everybody is waiting for the next surprise
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin

This is Halloween, everybody scream
Won't ya please make way for a very special guy
Our man Jack is king of the pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now

This is Halloween, this is Halloween
'alloween, 'alloween
'alloween, 'alloween

In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
(Ooh) Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want anymore from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
(Ooh) Tainted love

Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
But now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love

Once I ran to you (I ran)

Grüner Samt!

Endlich wird wieder geraucht
Komm schon Marsi, gib ein aus!
Grüner Rauch zieht über's Land
Grüner Samt!

Marsimoto der erste Mohikaner
Endlich wieder viel Gras, Spannung und Indianer
Die grüne Blue Man Group, der blaue Hulk,
Der schwarze Jack Black, der weiße Berry White
Du siehst nen' Denkmal zwischen einstürzenden Altbauten
Du siehst ne Blume wachsen mitten auf nem' Scheißhaufen!
Wer nie die Wahrheit sagt braucht auch nicht lügen
Ein Schmetterling ist eben nur ne Raupe mit Flügeln
Hab Trick 17 schon 18 mal gespielt
Der neue James Bond, die alte Britney Spears
Hatte nen Fallschirm dabei am 11. September
Ich hab angefangen mit nem Throw ya, Throw ya Hands up!

Augen auf, wo bin ich?!
Seh nur Palmen, heißen Sand und es ist windig
Sieht aus wie ne Insel, sieht aus wie gemalt
Ein Traum wird wahr und ich hab nichtmal was bezahlt!
Ruh mich erstmal aus, bau mir schnell ne' Sandburg
Überall nur Felsen und nen' Fels in der Brandung
Kokussnüsse falln' vom Himmel
Ein Schwarm Sardinen zieht vorbei, ich stürz mich in's Getümmel
Und plötzlich bist du da
Schöner runder Basketball, aus den USA
Ich sag "HI!", du sagst erstmal nix
Ich nehm dich an die Hand, du zeigst mir ein paar Tricks

Hook:

Nein! Ich bin nicht alleine!
Nein! Ich bin nicht alleine!
Nein! Ich bin nicht alleine!
Renn über die Insel mit nem' Ball an der Leine
Die Sonne lacht für uns
Du zeigst mir deine Kunst
Wir Baun' zusamm' ein Haus
Oben auf dem Baum
Wow! Nur fürs uns beide!
Du bist mein bester Kumpel

Yeah, du bist mein Kumpel Spalding
Wer war dein Vorbild? Na klar Michael Jordan
Wir fang' an zu quatschen, schön das du Zeit hast
Hast du Geschwister? Ja, Willson und Freitag!
Ich geb dir nen Korb, bau ihn in den Sand
Ich sag "Bitte" und du dunkst aus dem Stand
Mittlerweise hab ich einen Bart bis zu den Knien
Ich bin Marsi, Kein Bock mich zu rasieren
Ein Flugzeug kommt, fast hätt' es uns entdeckt
Schnell rein in's Versteck, Wir wolln' hier nichtmehr weg
Die Krabbe macht Salat
Die Schlange macht Spagat
Meine kleine Insel, kurz vor Dänemark!

Die Wellen die du siehst schlagen gegen diese Felsen
Seit drei Milliarden Jahren
Ob sie uns bemerken oder ob sie sich an irgendwas erinnern
Wir waren schon einmal kurz da
Haben alles getan
Es hat endlich geklappt
Halten etwas auf dem Arm das so aussieht wie wir
Es wird doppelt so schön
Es wird doppelt so viel
Wenn ich es teile mit dir – unendliche Weiten
Wir schicken Roboter auf Reisen
Bringt uns was Schönes mit
Wir schreiben – lassen es in Flaschen treiben
Bestimmt gibt's ne' Nachricht zurück
Wir wachen auf mit Sorgen
Wachen auf mit Falten
Wachen auf mit 'nem Lächeln im Gesicht
Jemand geht, wir holen Wasser
Löschen sein Feuer
Trotzdem vergessen wir ihn nicht

Denn wir leben auf einem blauen Planet
Der sich um einen Feuerball dreht
Mit 'nem Mond der die Meere bewegt
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und ein Schmetterling schlägt seine Flügel
Die ganze Erdkugel bebt
Wir haben überlebt
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder

Wir sind so weit auseinander
Doch fühlen uns so nah
Spreche deine Sprache nicht, doch versteh jedes Wort
Ich muss nur kurz an dich denken
Das Telefon klingelt
Es bleibt ein mystischer Ort
Lawinen aus Metall rollen jeden Morgen durch die Stadt
An unseren Fenstern vorbei
Mama Erde trägt Klunker – schmückt sich mit Brillanten
Wir rauben sie aus und bestimmen einen Preis
Wir sind Schwarz, wir sind Weiß, wir sind Grün
Und Gelb, Blau, Grau oder Rot
Wir sind mal Hendrix, Mozart, Biggy, Queens of the Stone Age und Depeche Mode
Wir gucken bis zum Urknall
Ich kann hören wie dein Herz tobt
Egal ob wir fallen oder aufsteigen
Du hast doch schon mal gewonnen
Gegen Millionen die so waren wie du
Das muss doch ausreichen, man

Wir leben auf einem blauen Planet
Der sich um einen Feuerball dreht
Mit 'nem Mond der die Meere bewegt
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und ein Schmetterling schlägt seine Flügel
Die ganze Erdkugel bebt
Wir haben überlebt
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder

Wir leben auf einem blauen Planet
Der sich um einen Feuerball dreht
Mit 'nem Mond der die Meere bewegt
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und du glaubst nicht an Wunder
Und ein Schmetterling schlägt seine Flügel

Drehen die Boombox auf - Bababoom, Badabam
Müssen raus hier, weil's uns auffrisst, hin wo's laut ist
Im Blaulicht getränkte Kulisse, ich brauch dich
Rauch sticht in die knallroten Augen
Sind wie Hunde, rennen alles über'n Haufen
Und schon stellen sie sich auf
Wenn man nichts im Kopf hat wozu werden Helme gebraucht?
Sie sehen es wird hell durch den Staub, diese Welt ist so laut
Es macht Boom und die Hälfte wird taub
Sehe vor mir nur 'ne Horde Zebras
Bin resistent gegen Tränengas
Steine regnen, sie werfen mit Wasser
Jeder Cop kontrolliert von 'nem Bastard
Jetzt wird Goethe zitiert, also Faust hoch
São Paulo, Paris, ja jetzt brennen wieder Autos
Leben von der Nacht in den Tag
Nicht nur unsere Schatten sind schwarz

Und ich stell mich unter das rote Licht
Gib mir Schutz, in meiner Hand Pyro

Sie ziehen unsere unausprechbaren Namen in den Schmutz

Ihr seid keine Maler, nur weil ihr die Wahrheit vertuscht
Eure Barrikaden sind Luft
Laden Signalfarben, warten (warten, warten) - Schuss
Die Straße versinkt
Sind die Zeugen Mandelas, Zeugen Martin Luther Kings
Käfige auf, lasst weiße Tauben fliegen
Evolution wird mit R geschrieben
Tibet, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Kairo
Wut in dei'm Blut, klettert deinen Hals hoch
Und dein Kopf explodiert
Wir feiern ein Fest, weil ein Opfer regiert
Jetzt wird Goethe zitiert, also Faust hoch

In der guten alten Zeit war'n alle Donnerstags schon breit
Ich sitz' auf'm Sofa, rauch das ganze Zeug allein
Alle sind jetzt "Troy" niemand geht mehr raus
Keiner kämpft mehr bis zum "Endboss" – alle geben auf
Jeder geht jetzt joggen, redet über seinen Bauch
Bevor die "Lila Wolken" kommen sind alle längst zuhaus'

Alle haben 'nen Job – ich hab' Langeweile!
Keiner hat mehr Bock auf Kiffen, Saufen, Feiern
So ist das hier im Block, Tag ein Tag aus
Halt mir zwei Finger an den Kopf und mach:
Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Alle haben 'nen Job – ich hab' Langeweile!
Keiner hat mehr Bock auf Kiffen, Saufen, Feiern
So ist das hier im Block, Tag ein Tag aus
Halt mir zwei Finger an den Kopf und mach:
Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Jeder glücklich Zweiter, keiner mehr Verlierer
Keiner geht mehr klauen, freundlich zum Kassierer
Alle ziehen aufs Land in die große Stadt nie wieder
Silbernes Besteck – Goldener Retriever
Alle mähen Rasen, putzen ihre Fenster
Jeder ist jetzt Zahnarzt – keiner ist mehr Gangster
Keiner fälscht mehr Stempel – alle gehen schwimmen
Jeder steht jetzt auf der Liste – niemand geht mehr hin
Keiner will mehr ballern, treffen um zu reden
Keiner macht mehr Malle, alle fahren nach Schweden
Jeder liebt die Bayern, vor'm Essen beten
Leben die kleinen Träume, verbrennen die großen Pläne

Alle haben 'nen Job – ich hab' Langeweile!
Keiner hat mehr Bock auf Kiffen, Saufen, Feiern
So ist das hier im Block, Tag ein Tag aus
Halt mir zwei Finger an den Kopf und mach:
Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Randale und Krawall, die Zeiten sind längst vorbei
Wo sind meine Leute hin, die waren früher überall
Was all die anderen starten sieht wie ne Landung aus
Und die Welt sie dreht sich weiter nur nicht mehr ganz so laut

(Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!)

Say it was your babel
Say it was my babel
It was my babel
Tell all people

Now you know it's over
Rolling off her shoulder
You can take a ladder to the shadows and forget
Was it how she kissed you
And then dismissed you?
Was it purposeful or was it just to hook you in?

Hallucinating
Chasing, changing
Racing, breaking
Hating till you lost it all
Where was your girlfriend?
She was not going
Where you were going
You are on your own

He was quick to burning
He was slow to learning
Though inside you're misted, he still kissed her when she cried
And did your best to please her
You did you end up and leave her
You befriended the harsh way it ended, now sleep tight

Hallucinating
Chasing, changing
Pacing, bracing
Breaking till you lost it all
??? to see
She beat you to it
and then you do it

Now you wanna be the one that shoots that truth ???
I'm running so far out of my head
This sprain of heart that ripples my day
You can never sail by thinking away

I'm not good in a crowd
I've got skills I can't speak of
Things I've seen will chase me to the grave

I'm not good in a crowd
I've got skills I can't speak of over there
Things that I've seen will chase me to the grave

Led with your hands tied, fed to the sand flies
Stumble the dunes, complain to the moon
Backs to the wheel, there's granite to shove
Take it, they give it, so rivet for rivet
I will build for my family a bulletproof roof

How does it feel, the weight of the steel
The weight of the steel of the flat of the blade
How does it feel to kneel at the feet
To kneel at the feet of the choices you've made

I'm not good in a crowd
I've got skills I can't speak of
Things I've seen will chase me to the grave

Backs to the wheel, there's granite to shove
Take it, they give it, and rivet for rivet
I will build for my family a bulletproof roof

Gonna miss you but my love has gone forever

But I know this one is for real

It's unfortunate that when we feel a storm
We can roll ourselves over 'cause we're uncomfortable
Oh, well, the devil makes us sin
But we like it when we're spinning in his grip

Love is like a sin, my love
For the ones that feel it the most
Look at her with her eyes like a flame
She will love you like a fly and never love you again

It's unfortunate that when we feel a storm
Can roll ourselves over when we're uncomfortable
Oh, well, the devil makes us sin

Look at her with a smile like a flame
She will love you like a fly and never love you again

In deepest hollow of our minds
A system failure left behind

And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain
And their necks crane

Dull residue of what once was
A shattered cloud of swirling doves

And their eyes change
As they learn to see through flames
And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain

Their eyes change
As they learn to see through flames
And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain

Drops on rocks fall fast and fleeting
Hearts and wings commence to beating
What's unseen with all believing
Vision walls fall all receding

Vision walls fall all receding
Drops on rocks come fast and fleeting
Rhythm laws unleash their meaning
Usher us into the dreaming

Vision walls fall all receding
Hearts and wings commence to beating
All unending, all completing
Vision walls fall fast and fleeting

Vision walls fall all revealing
Vision walls fall all revealing
Vision walls fall all revealing
Vision walls fall all revealing

In deepest hollow of our minds

I'm looking for you in the woods tonight
I'm looking, looking for you with my flashlight
I'm searching from in the high or down the ocean
And I pace myself in racing
Gain the wolf, gain the wolf

Conjure me as a child
Slipping down the wet side
Stretch up, I cannot reach him
Jumping up, they drag him from the water
I watch them march him into life
I watch them take him from the pale
Into the sky for your eagle eye
The sun seeds a sickle and a scythe

Ridicule they won't allow
Quench abuse and let love flower
Rip the cage out of your chest
Let the chaos fool the rest
Show without showing
What you know without knowing
Twigs snap, I catch, no canoe
Only you and me, alone on the old teal sea

Dissolving who we are
Call out for yesterday's destiny gone
We're on a foreign shore
It was the mark of falling
I was the car still running
And when you call I'll be your shield for life
And if you feel it, you'll fly
The sunset a-begging me
And I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in
As I was set to fall in

I wanna be clean but I gotta get high
It's good to be here, so hard to come by
You bring pain 'cause you got game
And needles and pins a man can't take

Peaches living in niches
Digging the scene like beautiful cliches
From these shapes of a gangster lean
Ignoring wars on gasoline
Our God's on yearning and made to get high
God's left hand wasn't made to get by
Got more highs left in me
And there's more room in recovery

From evil states that strip all chrome
From Marshall Amps into broken homes
And borstal blues to countless clicks
That rhythm sticks to those classic cheques
Steal your tears and drown your fears
All is clear in a glass of beer

Peaches living in niches
Digging the scene like beautiful cliches
You fill me with endorphins
And you star in magazines
We draw liquor from the mattress springs
It ain't over till the last bell rings
Got more highs, you and me
And deluxe rooms in recovery

Lost in the magic from the last time
This town turning, my rose to desire

Saturday come slow, do you love me?
Do you love me? Is there nothing there?

In the limestone caves, in the south ways lands
One time in the kingdom, belief is on the stand

Saturday come slow, do you love me?
Do you love me? Is there nothing there?

Saturday come slow, do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Is there nothing there?

The baby was born
Nettles and ferns
The evening, it chokes
The candle, it burns
This disguise covers
Bitter lies
Repeating the joke
The meaning, it dies
Pass me a coat
I'm not afraid to leave
I'm letting you know
I know what you need
I'll turn you around
This beautiful town
And then you'll believe it
When your eyes then deceive you

It's easy, dont let it go
It's easy, dont let it go
It's easy, dont let it go
Don't lose it

It's getting colder outside
Your rented space
They shadow box
And they paper chase
It never stops
And we'll never learn
No hope without dope
The jobless return
The bankers have bailed
The mighty retreat
The pleasure, it fails
At the end of the week
You take it or leave
Or what you receive
To what you receive
Is eternited leave

It's easy, dont let it go
It's easy, dont let it go
It's easy, dont let it go
Don't lose it

Incandescent light at doors
In adolescent menopause
In little clicks you got the music stops
The needle sticks and the penny drops
The summer's gone before you know
The muffled drums of relentless flow
You're looking at stars that give you vertigo
The sun's still burning and dust will blow
Honey scars, I'll keep you near
Our blood is gold, nothing to fear
We killed the time and I love you, dear
A kiss of wine, we'll disappear
The last of the last particles
Divisible, invisible
The last of the last particles
Divisible, invisible

You see a man's face
But you don't see his heart
You see a man's face
But you will never know his thoughts

Everywhere you go
There's a man to say love
Never neither

Take it to heart
For your heart is your heart
And your thoughts is your thoughts
Never mix love with hatred

You see a man's face
You will never see his heart

Shame, such a shame
I think I kind of lost myself again
Day, yesterday
I really should be leaving but I stay

Say, say my name
I need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain
It's easy to remember when it came

'Cause it feels like I've been
I've been here before
You are not my saviour
But I still don't go

Feels like something
That I've done before
I could fake it
But I still want more

Fade, made to fade
Passion's overrated anyway

Say, say my name
I need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain
It's easy to remember when it came

'Cause it feels like I've been
I've been here before
You are not my saviour

A flask, I drink of sober tea while relay cameras monitor me
And the buzz surrounds, it does (buzz surrounds, buzz surrounds)
Closed eyed, sky wide open, unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
Elsewhere, indefinitely far away, magnifies and deepens

Ready to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
And listening (keeps me from my hurt), my ears know that my eyes are closed (perish thoughts like contraband)
I train myself in martial arts as advertised
I reinforce my softened parts as advertised

See through me, little glazed lane a world in myself

Ready to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath (flickering I roam)
And listening, my ears know that my eyes are closed
Ready to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath (flickering I roam)
And listening, my ears know that my eyes are closed

I see to bolts, put keys to locks, no boat are rocked, I'm free to roam
On dummy screens and magazines
Closed eyed, sky wide open, unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
To think that I lay next to you wasting time when I could do
A simple job in strip lights, a flask, I drink a sober tea
'Till daylight sends me home flickering I roam

Daydreaming admiring being quietly open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky turning over at midnight
See through me, little glazed lane, a world in myself
Daydreaming admiring being quietly open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky turning over at midnight

Recollect me darling, raise me to your lips
Two undernourished egos, four rotating hips
Hold on to me tightly, I'm a sliding scale
Can't endure, then you can't inhale
Clearly, out of body experience interferes
And dreams of flying I fit nearly
Surrounds me though I get lonely

Slowly, moving up slowly, inertia keeps, she's moving up slowly
Slowly, moving up slowly, inertia creeps, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, she comes, moving up slowly
Inertia creeps, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, she comes, moving up slowly

In my home no chrome as clear as
See me now where my nearest tear is
Been there when I'm over careering
Room shifting is endearing
Between us is our kitchen
When she found my irritant's itchin'
Been here before, been here forever

Moving up slowly, inertia keeps, moving up slowly
Inertia creeps, moving up slowly, inertia keeps, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly, inertia creeps, moving up slowly
She comes

I make no sound in my Eiderdown
Awake I lie and the morning's blue
Room is still, my antenna in you
Nylon burns the bedspread, we're two
Gravity's zero, see me stall
I bounce off walls, lose my footing and fall
It can be sweet though incomplete though
And the frames will freeze, see me on all fours
It's been a long time

She comes, she comes

I want to X you, she comes
I want to X you, she comes
I want to X you

Caught your radio waves
I caught your radio waves, will you take a string?
Say you string me along, say you string me along
Say inertia creeps. Inertia creeps and she comes
Say she comes, say she comes, say she comes, say she comes

There's a man that live next door
In my neighborhood, in my neighborhood
He gets me down

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
And find a quiet place

Hear the pots and pans they fall
Bang against the wall
Bang against the wall
No rest at all

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay

I'm a little curious of you in crowded scenes
And how serene your friends and fiends
We flew and strolled as two eliminated gently
Why don't you close your eyes and reinvent me
You knew you got a heart made of stone
You should have let me know
You could have let me know
We'll go 'till morning comes
And traffic grows, and windows hum
Spending all week with your friends
Give me evenings and weekends
Evenings and weekends

I could be yours, we can unwind
All these outflows, all these outflows

You'd agree it's a typical high
You fly as you watch your name go by
And once the name goes by
Not thicker than water, nor thicker than mud
And the eight k thuds it does
Sunset so thickly, let's make it quiet and quickly
Don't frown, taste better on the way back down

I could be yours, we can unwind
All these outflows, all these outflows
All these outflows will lead to mine

We are vi-vicious, it's easy now, see
Stick me down, stick me down

We can unwind, all these other flaws
All these other flaws will lead to mine, will see to
All these other flaws, all these outflows will seem to...
All these outflows, will lead to mine
We can unwind all our flaws
We can unwind all our flaws

I seen you go down to a cold mirror
It was never clearer in my era, so
You lick a shine upon your forehead or
Check it by the signs in the corridor
You light my ways through the club maze
We would struggle through the dub daze

I seen myself in there upon my lover
It's how you go down to the men's room sink
Sad we talk of how madmen think
I seen myself in there upon my lover
I don't know her from another Miss
I don't know you from another

See me run now you're gone, dream on

Why you want to take me to this party and breathe?
I'm dying to leave
Every time we grind you know we severed lines
Where have all those flowers gone, long time passing
Why you keep me testing, keep me tasking?
You keep on asking

Toy-like people make me boy-like
Toy-like people make me boy-like
They're invisible, when the trip it flips
They get physical, way below my lips
And everything you got's, hoi polloi like
Now you're lost, and you're lethal
And now's about a time you gotta leave all
these good people, dream on

Nicer than the bird up in the tree-top
Cheaper than the chip inside my laptop
All the variations you could do with me
Nicer than the girl up in your mind you're free

Automatic crystal remote control
They come to move your soul

You kinda fade into the backgrounds
Like a better smoke'll bring you back rounds
Like a man slide inside you my dear
Your cheap beer's filled with crocodile tears
See 'em run now you're gone, dream on

Toy-like people make me boy-like
Toy-like people make me boy-like

I found a reason, I found a reason
Dream on, dream on, dream on

Don't know why minutes seem like hours

I'm gonna tell you something
You should never tell your spouse.

The reason I'm scared to have kids
Is all I see when I look at the world is crap.

How am I supposed to bring a kid into this world feeling like that?

I knew, when I'd meet the right guy,
He would make me feel safe to have that kid,
He would change the way I see things.

On our wedding day,
When I walked down the aisle and I saw you waiting,
I knew you weren't the guy to make me feel safe to change the way I see things.

Step up, you're a kid!

How could you say that?
How could you say that to me!?

Das Kleingeistliche wär mein Gral

dafür gibt's noch so viel Zeit . . .

Sie jagd den Trend, sie ist gefährlich
obszön, vulgär, abgrundtief und ehrlich
veführt, verhurt und provokant
das Luder hat dich in der Hand

Ich bin klein, mein Herz ist rein
kannst du nicht mein Spielzeug sein

Jagdzeit, es ist Jagdzeit

Die Bitch die jeder bei Namen kennt
Der Haken an dem dein Herz schon hängt

Lauf, lauf Baby lauf

Das Lächeln so echt wie ihre Titten
Magnet für Männer mit großen Schlitten
Sie spielt mit Reizen und macht dir Feuer
Ihre Liebe ist launisch und sündhaft teuer

Der heiße Fäger der mit dir den Boden wischt
Die Schlange die dir Eiskalt jede Lüge auftischt
Die Bitch die jeder bei Namen kennt
Die Nutte die dir am Arsch jetzt brennt

Ich bin klein, mein Herz ist rein
willst du nicht mein Opfer sein

Jagdzeit, es ist Jagdzeit
drum lauf, lauf Baby lauf

Die Puppe die mit dir Schlitten fährt
Das Blonde Gift das dein Herz verzehrt

Jagdzeit, lauf Baby lauf

Verlogene Bitch, durchtriebenes Luder
im Bett hast du die Hand am Ruder

Deine Lippen, dein Mund, dein Sex
dein Wille hat mich verhext
deine Augen, dein Duft, dein Haar, dein Wissen,
deine Macht, deine Fesseln, dein Schmutz, mein Gewissen
deine Macht, meine Hände, dein Blick
dein Faden, meine Lust, dein Fick

Jagdzeit!

Jagdzeit, es ist Jagdzeit

Das Weib das ewig lockt und ruft
die Beute die das Weite sucht

Lauf, lauf Baby lauf

Die Spur ist frisch, bereit zum Sprung
Schlachtfest auf der Waldlichtung

Willst du oder kannst du? Musst du oder hast du schon?
Weißt du oder meinst du? Glaubst du oder denkst du nur?
Machst du oder lässt du? Bist du oder tust nur so?
Was ist die Frage? Die eine, die an dir frisst?

Du bist von Haus aus uneins, lebst mit dir selbst im Krieg
Jemand, der aus seinen Fehlern nie Konsequenzen zieht
Was bringt dich nur ins Straucheln, was ist denn dein Problem?
Wo steckt der Fehlerteufel in deinem Denksystem?

Kopf, Kopf oder Zahl, Hop oder Top, du hast die Wahl
Was glaubst du zu erreichen, wenn du nie für etwas bist?
Wenn du dich nicht entscheidest, der Zweifel an dir frisst
Kopf oder Zahl

Lebst du oder träumst du? Suchst du noch nach dem Glück?
Fühlst du, sag liebst du? Oder stirbst du nur Stück für Stück?
Siehst du oder fliehst du? Was ist das große Ziel?
Wer hält das beste Blatt in deinem Schicksalsspiel?

Wirf eine Münze, spiele Schicksal, du kniest in deinen Ängsten
Erstickst an deiner Furcht, hast du nie was riskiert?
Hast du es nicht einmal versucht?
Kopf oder Zahl

Was bleibt für dich, wenn dein Ende naht?
Immer nur Ausreden und kein echtes Ziel
Schuld sind nur die Anderen, alles wird dir zu viel
Was gibt dir Kraft, wohin führt dein Weg?
Ist alles vorbestimmt, was hält dich denn bloß auf?
Steckt die Kugel für dein Leben schon im Mündungslauf?

Kopf, Kopf oder Zahl, Hop oder Top, du hast die Wahl
Das Leben stellt die Weichen, es zeigt dir nur den Weg
Du musst schon selbst entscheiden, wohin die Reise geht
Kopf oder Zahl

Wirf deine Münze, spiel mit deinem Schicksal
Kannst du von dir behaupten, du hast deinen Traum gelebt?
Was bleibt von deinen Taten, wenn deine Stunde schlägt?
Kopf oder Zahl

Siehst du mich
Hörst du mich
Was hab ich dir getan
Warum zerstörst du mich
Fühlst du mich
Spürst du mich
Wenn du mich nicht mehr liebst
warum berührst du mich
Brauchst du mich
Sag glaubst du nicht
Dass es besser ist
du lebst dein Leben ohne mich
Erkennst du mich
Verstehst du nicht
Warum bist du überhaupt noch hier
Was willst du noch von mir

Augen auf
Wer sieht versteht
wie gnadenlos die Zeit vergeht
wie sich der Zeiger dreht
unentwegt
Er steht nie still

Du weißt nicht was du willst
Du weißt nicht wo du stehst
weißt nicht woher du kommst
wohin du gehst
Du weißt nicht was dich treibt
was am Ende für dich bleibt
Warum bist du so blass
so kalt so herzlos
Du weißt nicht was du tust
weißt nicht woran du glaubst
Sag mir wozu und ob
du mich noch brauchst
Wenn's einfach nicht mehr passt
Wenn du mich wirklich nur noch hasst
Warum bist du noch hier
Wofür
Was willst du noch von mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch von mir

Siehst du mich
Erkennst du mich
Ganz tief in meinem Herz ist noch ein Platz für dich
Ich suche dich
Ich sehne mich
nach dem was ich geliebt hab
doch ich find' es nicht

Augen auf
Wer sieht versteht
wie gnadenlos die Zeit vergeht
wie sich der Zeiger dreht
unentwegt
Er steht nie still

Viel zu lange
Viel zu spät
Sturm geerntet
Wind gesät
die Zeit vergeht
unentwegt
Sie steht nie still

Du weißt nicht was du willst
Du weißt nicht wo du stehst
weißt nicht woher du kommst
wohin du gehst
Du weißt nicht was dich treibt
was am Ende für dich bleibt
Warum bist du so blass
so kalt so herzlos
Du weißt nicht was du tust
weißt nicht woran du glaubst
Sag mir wozu und ob
du mich noch brauchst
Wenn's einfach nicht mehr passt
Wenn du mich wirklich nur noch hasst
Warum bist du noch hier
Wofür
Was willst du noch von mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du wirklich noch von mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch von mir
Sag Mir
Was willst du noch

Was willst du noch
Was willst du wirklich noch von mir

Album  Totgesagte Leben Länger
Vernascht und ausgespuckt
Zu lang, zu viel geschluckt
Betrogen, zur Schnecke gemacht
Belogen und ausgelacht
Verführt und dann gehörnt
Versetzt und abgeturned
Verzehrt und ausgeschwitzt
Entflammt und abgeblitzt
Geblendet, verhungert und
Verendent
Die beste Zeit
Verschwendent
An eine Schlampe wie dich

Du bist ein Miststück
Du bist das Stück Mist
Du bist ein Miststück
Ein Stück Mist

Geküßt und infiziert
Gehaßt und abserviert
Betrogen und ausgelacht
Verbrannt und kaltgemacht
Verführt und dann verletzt
Berührt und ausgesetzt
Mein Bett umsonst beschmutzt
Verdreht und ausgenutzt
Geblendet, verhungert und
Verendet
Die beste Zeit
Verschwendet
An eine Schlampe wie dich

Du bist ein Miststück
Du bist das Stück Mist
Du bist ein Miststück
Ein Stück Mist

Ich kann nicht, ich kann nicht
Ich kann nicht ohne dich sein
Ich kann nicht, ich kann nicht
Ich kann nicht mit dir
Ich kann nicht, ich kann nicht
Ich kann nicht allein sein
Miststück
Ich haße dich

Ich kann nicht, ich kann nicht
Ich kann nicht ohne dich sein
Ich kann nicht, ich kann nicht
Ich kann nicht mit dir
Ich kann nicht, ich kann nicht
Ich kann nicht allein sein
Fick dich
Gottverdammtes Miststück!

Geblendet, verhungert und
Verdorben ich weiß genau
Schon morgen
Will ich dich wieder zurück

Du bist ein Miststück
Du bist das Stück Mist
Du bist ein Miststück
Ein Stück Mist

An even strobe a pulse of flashing hate
Lights of synthetic souls massproduced
Hammered into shape a sign of times dreams
Turn into systems a new way a new breed
Implanted in our minds

Here I am in the hand of a sterile hate
The new control I can not wake
I'm not a sleep

New intelligence arise in emptied bodies
Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic
Fits through not known codes mother
Machine in genocide now scorn a dying race

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me
Changing what am I to be contorted
An eternity defeated

Programmed to appease you we're symbols of perfection
Humanoids runed by your laws:
Destroy erase improve lesson first:
Submission we're docile servant dogs
Our leashes are your limbs computed deep within

Remoted minds controlled our thoughts
No more doubts
The new way is here disgorged
Another thousands fakes that obey to a circuit skein to vacuum

Mechanical thoughts
I now conceive no longer me
Always to see inanity
Millions to be units like me
Eternally human patterns
Copied, dissected, distorted
Completed to fit the machine
The nerve fibres give in to cords to the unknown

See me be me same contents same machine

The currency of ours
No more flesh and bone
We are too unaware of what we have been before

Evolution in reverse
Now it's time for me
Changing what am I to be contorted
An eternity defeated by the new machine

Album  Destroy Erase Improve
Squint your eyes to see clearly
Blur reality to make it real
Let focus go from your deceiving eyes
To know what's been concealed
We've all been blinded
Subjects to visual misinformation
A systematic denial of the crystalline

To see the fine grain, to read the hidden words
The context of parallel truth
Devoid of fragmentation

Our light-induced image of truth
Filtered blank of its substance
As our eyes won't adhere to intuitive lines
Everything examined, separated, one thing at a time
The harder we stare
The more complete the disintegration
Dissolution

Eyes re-opened
Reasoning focalized
Receptors activated

Perspectives distorted
The ladder beyond our grasp
The twin-headed serpent forever hidden
Where's the true knowledge
Where engines of the sane and insanity merge
The clarity
The unity

Reality untouchable, transparent
Invisible to our fixed, restricted fields of vision
Existence taken for granted
Absolute

Possessed, owned, controlled
By the common sense-infected rational gaze
Onward forever we walk among the ignorant
Never stray from the common lines

___________________
Name  Rational Gaze
Artist  Meshuggah
Album  Nothing
Beams of fire sweep through my head
Thrusts of pain increasingly engaged
Sensory receptors succumb
I am no one now, only agony

My crimson liquid so frantically spilled
The ruby fluid of life unleashed

Ripples ascend to the surface of my eyes
Their red pens drawing at random, at will
A myriad pains begotten in their wake
The bastard spawn of a mutinous self

The regurgitation of my micro nemesis
Salivating red at the prospect of my ruin, my doom

Malfunction - the means for its ascent
Bloodletting - the stringent voice to beckon my soul
So futile, any resisting tension
As death-induced mechanics propel its growth

The implement, the device of my extinction
The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane
The definitive scourge of its mockery
The end-art instruments lethality attained

Heed - it commands, heed my will
Bleed - it says, bleed you will

Falling into the clarity of undoing
Scornful gods haggle for my soul
Mind's eye flickers and vascillates as I let go
Taunting whispers accompany my deletion

A sneering grin, the voice of my reaper
Chanting softly the song of depletion

___________
Name  Bleed
Artist  Meshuggah
Album  ObZen
No more ifs, no bias, no ambiguity
No wondering whether this is it
Clarity so brightly shining
The image so painfully absolute

No edges blurred on this awareness
No unknown weight to tip the knowledge scales
Eyes dilated to grasp it all
As every illusion of what we are fails

An unquestionable picture - determined, complete
Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt
So vivid, so deprived of hesitation
Shining in its evil splendor

The burning hatred of man
A million degrees on display
Human voracity delineated
The demons in us all by fumes portrayed

Stare, see, take in, grasp
Comprehend, assimilate, behold your reflection

The framing - gold plated lies
The canvas - hurting souls caught and weaved
The artist - the human dream
Incinerated, devoured, deceived

Name  Combustion
Artist  Meshuggah
Album  ObZen
A state of perfection, immersed in filth
Equilibrium obtained
Pure in devotion to all things unwell
This sweet Zen of our ill condition sustained

A new belief-system
Salvation found in vomit and blood
Where depravation, lies
Corruption, war and pain is God

Balance
Harmony found in the sickly, the vile
Unflinching eyes, joyous and gleaming
Intense in their need to watch things die

A new belief-system
Salvation found in vomit and blood
Where depravation, lies
Corruption, war and pain is God

Decay, disgrace, disgust
Our state of Zen

The grime of contempt and degeneration
Sticky, foul and pungent
The sediment of our creation
We flourish in this bloodred soil

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me loving every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away

Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright, yeah (alright)
Someone to need me
Love me every single night, yeah

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time, yeah yeah
She make me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime

I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived

You gotta believe me
Hey, I'm talking to you

Well, I know, it's hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die

Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, ha ha

Whoa, feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love
It's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time, yeah
Oh ooh, she makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
She's all mine, yeah
Yo, yeah

As I was goin' over
The Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell
And his money he was countin'

I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier

Oh, "Or the Devil, he may take ya."

Yeah

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Master, master
Master, master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land
Yeah-heah!

Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take
(Pray the Lord my soul to take)

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Boooooo!
Yeah, yeah!
Yo oh!

We're off to Never Never Land (Take my hand)
We're off to Never Never Land (Take my hand)
We're off to Never Never Land
We're off to Never Never Land

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

(And the road becomes my bride)
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay as slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah!

Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah!

(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

And my ties are severed clean
Less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
And you will, yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere

Life it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Our house wrapped in disrepair,
A small mouse peeked out from a hole beneath the stairs
nearby to where my dad sat in his favorite chair,
Thinking about the gov't and muttering a prayer
I scattered some oats in hopes she'd stay
And sat still to stop from scaring her away-
But she hurried on her little way
And scurried around my mind
Ever since,
Every day

Open wide my door, my door, my Lord
(Open wide my door)
To whatever makes me love You more
(Open wide my door)
While there's still light to run towards
(Open wide my door)

Like water on dry wood
Equal parts misguided and misunderstood
But all the neighborhood
Watched a fire burn from where they stood
And the smoke said
"We're not half as bad as G-d is good"
And there's a whisper in my ear,
The voice of loneliness and fear, so I say:

"Devil, disappear!
I'm still (ehh... technically...) a virgin
After 27 years-
Which never bothered me before,
What's maybe 50 more?"

Open wide my door, my door, my Lord
(Open wide my door)
To whatever makes me love You more
(Open wide my door)
While there's still light to run towards
(Open wide my door)

She came back for the oats
But she brought along a "friend"
(This never ends)(This never ends)
The harder the rain,
The lower the flowers in the garden bend
(This never ends)(This never ends)
I'd rather never talk again
Than to continue to pretend
This never ends (This never ends)(This never ends)

January, 1979.
Saw a terrible crash and i couldn't help but laugh,
As my ear pressed against the past like a glass on a wall of a house in a photograph.
My forehead no longer sweet with holy kisses worthy of your fiery lips.
I was floating in a peaceful sea 'rescued' by a sinking ship.

If I could become the servant of all, no lower place to fall. (If could be your servant)
If I could become the servant of all, no lower place to fall. (If I could be your servant)
If I could become the servant of all, no lower place to fall. (If could be your servant)
If I could become the servant of all, no lower place to fall. (If I could be your servant)

You watch me like a ten car highway wreck with detached, vulgar curiosity.
This looking down at the tops of the hats of us passers-by from your 7th floor balcony.
From such a height you missed creatures too small for sight carry on covert conversations.
And the misguided insects crown me their grasshopper king with a dance of celebration.

After years with a crown on my head, I've grown overfed, unconcerned and comfortably numb.
Kept busy indulging in the pleasures of the wealthy.
(Someone make me afraid of what I've become!)
At the first sign of possible sorrow, I turned my heels and ran.
(Oh, I'll never learn.)
My life is a cup of sugar I've borrowed before time began and forgot to return.

It was a matter of time--I always said I could see so now I'm going blind. (I could be your servant)
It was a matter of time--I always said I could see so now I'm going blind. (If I could be your servant)
It was a matter of time--I always said I could see so now I'm going blind. (I could be your servant)
It was a matter of miserable time-- but I heard somewhere there was a cure for useless eyes? (If I could be your servant)

Album  Catch For Us The Foxes
Take the children and yourself
And hide out in the cellar
By now the fighting will be close at hand
Don't believe the church and state
And everything they tell you
Believe in me, I'm with the high command

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

There's a gun and ammunition
Just inside the doorway
Use it only in emergency
Better you should pray to God
The Father and the Spirit
Will guide you and protect from up here

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

Swear allegiance to the flag
Whatever flag they offer
Never hint at what you really feel
Teach the children quietly
For some day sons and daughters
Will rise up and fight while we stand still

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

Can you hear me, can you hear me running (can you hear me calling you?)
Can you hear me hear running, can you hear me calling you?
Can hear me running (can you hear me calling you)?
(Can you hear me?)

Hear me calling you
(Can you hear me running) hear me running, babe
Can you hear me running (hear me running)
Calling you, calling you

I love the silence I'm in
I think I dreamed this before
Some lives seem so incomplete
Some just keep coming back for more

Where did the time go?
Where did the time go?
Where did the time go?

I can't remember how it end
Don't even know who I am
A fading memory
A fading image redrawn
Can't wait for ever more

Where did the time go?
Where did the time go?
Where did the time go?

Remember every thing I never said
I've seen the faces before
I hope the future is dead
The dead keep asking for more

Where did the time go?

Where did the time go?
Where did the time go?

Always an angel there

Always an angel there

Always an angel there

One left out
When they pass heaven about
What about me
Sitting here in my purgatory?

So get out
He's dead (he's dead)
I'm alive (I'm alive)
He's spared

Always an angel who cares
Always an angel there

One like me
We try (so hard)
Five like you
Someone dead again

Where's your angel now?
(Where's your angel now?)
Where's your morals now?
(Where's your morals?)

Always an angel there

(Where's your angel now?)
(Always an angel who cares)
(Always an angel there)

(Where's your morals?)

(There's always an angel who cares)

(There's always an angel there)

No more people staring
No more fatal dares
Like a baby grabbing at
Something that isn't there
But it is (but it is, but it is, but it is)
But it is (but it is, but it is, but it is)

(Always an angel there)

I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Well, I got something to say
I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as she spread

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

Go!

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

Well, I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Sweet lovely death

Come sweet death, one last caress

One last caress, sweet death
One last caress, sweet death

Extreme ways are back again, extreme places I didn't know
I broke everything new again, everything that I'd owned
I threw it out the windows, came along, extreme ways I know
Will part the colors of my sea, perfect color me

Extreme ways that help me, that help me out late at night
Extreme places I had gone, but never seen any light
Dirty basements, dirty noise, dirty places coming through
Extreme worlds alone, did you ever like it then?

I would stand in line for this
There's always room in life for this

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Like it always does, always does

Extreme sounds that told me, they helped me down every night
I didn't have much to say, I didn't give up the light
I closed my eyes and closed myself and closed my world and never opened
Up to anything that could get me along

I had to close down everything, I had to close down my mind
Too many things that caught me, too much can make you blind
I've seen so much in so many places, so many heartaches, so many faces
So many dirty things, you couldn't even believe

I would stand in line for this
It's always good in life for this

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Like it always does, it always does

I'll decide
In a moment's time
To turn away
Leave it all behind

So inclined
Somewhere I would draw the line
The ground is hard
The treasure fine

So
Let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
So
Let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home

Tied to sky
When I was a child I'd
I'd run and hide
To be at your side

So inclined
Somewhere I would draw the line
I'd dream until
The stars were mine

So
Let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
So
Let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home

I'll decide
In a moment's time
To turn away
Leave it all behind

So inclined
Somewhere I would draw the line
The ground is hard
The treasure fine

So (And the stars fell from the sky)
Let it go (Falling down into the sea)
Wake up, wake up, wake up (Still I don't know if it's right)
We're almost home (If this world is right for me)
So (And the stars fell from the sky)
Let it go (Falling down into the sea)
Wake up, wake up, wake up (Still I don't know if it's right)
We're almost home (If this world is right for me)
So (And the stars fell from the sky)
Let it go (Falling down into the sea)
Wake up, wake up, wake up (Still I don't know if it's right)
We're almost home (If this world is right for me)
So
Let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home

Cheer up, Brian
You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life....

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back

Ich schwörs ich bin normalerweise ein netter Mensch
Aber irgendwann platzt mir auch mein Kragen
Ich schlage vor wir betreiben hier Anger Management
Anger Management
Warum ich morgens nicht mehr die Zeitung lese
Weil ich nicht kotzen will gleich nach dem aufstehen
Denn selbst wenn ich zwischen den Zeilen lese
Steht da Arschloch Dreckswelt Bauchweh
Obwohl ich gerne diesen Fraß erbräche
Auf dem Ökotest: Sehr Gut steht
Denn ich hol mir meine Magenkrebse
Viel lieber beim Promidinner Sternebuffet (Sterbebuffet)
Wir brauchen Schilder an jeder Ladentheke
Mit der Aufschrift Friss und Stirb
Ich bring der Post ein paar Sparpakete
Adressiert an den nächsten der Minister wird
Und wenn ich meinen Glauben verlieren will
Brauch ich keinen pädophilen Pater dazu
Wenn ihr uns das Blaue vom Himmel nicht mehr verkaufen könnt
Warum macht ihr euren Laden nicht zu
Ich habe kein Interesse an einer Rolle als Elternteil
Kann ja Kindergärtner werden wenn ich will
Ich persönlich setze keinen Nachwuchs mehr in diese Welt hinein
Denn Udo Lindenberg macht Werbung für die Bild
Fuck you

Ich schwör dir ich bin normalerweise ein netter Mensch
Aber irgendwann platzt mir auch mein Kragen
Ich schlage vor wir betreiben hier Anger Management
Indem wir alles kurz und klein schlagen
Alles kurz und klein schlagen
Ich schwör dir ich bin normalerweise ein Diplomat
Aber irgendwann muss auch ich nein sagen
Ich schlage vor wir benutzen diesmal den Krisenstab zum
Alles kurz und klein schlagen
Alles kurz und klein schlagen

Nein ich mag keine Ärzte
Gegen Dummheit gibt es keine Medizin
Und wenn doch dann würden die Pharmakonzerne
Sich sicher ne goldene Nase daran verdien
Denn diese Krankheit betrifft fast jeden
Nicht nur Schwule und Schwarze wie HIV
Du kannst ihre Anzeichen miterleben
Und zwar jeden Abend in der Tagesschau
Warum man Wahlurnen Wahlurnen nennt
Wirf deine Stimme ein und schweig wie ein Grab
Ich habe nur eine Stimme um damit zu sagen was ich denk
Die behalte ich die geb ich nicht ab
Und ich will einen Fuck You Button bei Facebook
Ich will meine Meinungsfreiheit zurück
Denn für meinen Hass ist es einfach kein Ausdruck
Wenn ich den gefällt mir Knopf nicht drück
Und komm mir nicht mit sei doch froh dass es dir nicht schlecht geht
Du bist Deutscher steh dazu
Obwohl ich dir eigentlich recht geb
Ja verdammt uns geht's zu gut
So wahnsinnig gut
Auf dem iPhone haben wir mehr Bücher als wir jemals werden lesen können
Im Fernsehen gibt es mehr Scheisse als wir je werden gucken können
Und wir haben verdammt nochmal mehr zu fressen als wir jemals kotzen können

Ich schwör dir ich bin normalerweise ein netter Mensch
Aber irgendwann platzt mir auch mein Kragen
Ich schlage vor wir betreiben hier Anger Management
Indem wir alles kurz und klein schlagen
Alles kurz und klein schlagen
Ich schwör dir ich bin normalerweise ein Diplomat
Aber irgendwann muss auch ich nein sagen

Er war länger schon vertieft in Berufliches am Telefon
Als du ihm sagtest du gehst eben Zigaretten holen
Doch du wolltest nicht wirklich zum Automaten laufen
Du wolltest einfach mal verschnaufen auf der Straße draußen
Weil diese einsamen Tage dir deinen Atem rauben
Da fährt ein Bus vielleicht solltest du dir ne Karte kaufen
Ihr habt euch immer gerne gehabt doch
Jetzt hat dich das Fernweh gepackt und
Du läufst durch die Schwärze der Nacht in den Straßen im Herzen der Stadt und
Du hast da mal so ne Geschichte aufgeschnappt
Von einem der nie wieder kam vom Kippenautomat
Und plötzlich hörst du diesen schrägen Ton
Du siehst ne Blaskapelle näherkomm
Und einer der vorne läuft hat ein Megaphon
Und fragt kommst du mit Wir gehen jetzt los

Wir gehn jetzt Geh geh geh mit uns geh
Geh geh geh mit uns geh
Geh geh geh mit uns geh
Geh geh geh mit uns

Du liegst im Bett und starrst an die Decke
Du kannst nicht pennen und hast keinen Bock mehr auf Schlaftabletten
Seitdem sie weg ist kommst du nicht mehr wirklich klar
Seitdem sie nicht zurück kam vom Kippenautomat
Seit diesem Tag bist du selbst nicht mehr wirklich da
Was du machst ist nicht mehr wichtig du denkst nicht mehr drüber nach
Bis heut'Nacht
Und du gehst auf die Straße raus
Nur um auszuatmen und gradeaus zu laufen
Du denkst vielleicht solltest du an andere Orte reisen
Da kommt n Bus du denkst kurz dran dich davor zu schmeißen
Da kommt ne Brücke und dann denkst du dran zu springen
Doch jemand fängt dann an zu singen
Und plötzlich hörst du diesen schrägen Ton
Du siehst ne Blaskapelle näherkomm
Und einer der vorne läuft hat ein Megaphon
Und fragt kommst du mit Wir gehen jetzt los

War die Welt eindeutig einfacher
Denn ich wollte eh nur Dreirad fahren
Und danach bolzen gehen mit meinem Papa
Ich mochte Apfelmus und Kaiserschmarrn
Glaubte an das Gute und den Weihnachtsmann
Und ich hab mich immer sehr sehr leicht getan
Erwachsen werden war nicht eingeplant
Denn Mama konnte mir die Welt erklären
Aber jetzt wo ich älter werde
Spür ich immer nur die selbe Leere
Und wüsste wirklich nicht wie mir zu helfen wäre
Und noch weniger dem Erdklumpen auf dem ich leb
Diesem armseligen blauen Planet
Bei dessen Anblick sogar Gott die Augen verdreht
Weil der rechte Glaube ihm fehlt
Und glaub mir ich kann den alten Mann verstehen
Man braucht sich das Ganze doch nur mal anzusehen
Und man merkt sehr schnell wir haben ein verdammtes Problem
Und keinen scheints etwas anzugehen
Komm zieh den Umhang an es wird Zeit sich der Sache anzunehmen
Was bleibt uns als jetzt unseren Mann zu stehen
Darf ich vorstellen Moop Mama sehr angenehm
Wir ändern das im Handumdrehn
Und jetzt schau mal nach oben ist das ne fliegende Untertasse
Oder ne neue amerikanische Wunderwaffe
Nein es ist das Moop Mama Logo am Himmel
Wir haben keine Superkräfte aber so große ...

Wo sind die Helden hin
Sag mir wo sind die Helden hin
Wo wo wo wo sind die Helden hin
Sag kann es sein dass wir es selber sind

Ok jetzt geh ich langsam auf die Dreißiger
Bekomme jeden Tag ein weißes Haar
Warum das so ist Mann ich weiß nicht mal
Ich wache auf und es ist einfach da
Verdammt ich komme mir vor wie in einer Geisterbahn
Erschreck vor mir selber morgens in meinem Bad
Ich seh da einen der nichts außer Zweifel hat
Keine Ideale keinen Plan
Und ich bin damit nicht allein in meiner Generation
So war das nicht gemeint mit der Evolution
Der Mensch: ein fettes und verfressenes Tier
Das chattet bis die Wirbelsäule degeneriert
Es wird wärmer die Pinguine findens richtig beschissen
Weil sie plötzlich in Riesen-Wasserpfützen sitzen und schwitzen
Und wir wollen alle lieber nichts davon wissen
Frau Holle schüttelt nur noch den Kopf und nicht mehr die Kissen
Und glaub mir ich kann die gute Frau verstehen
Wir scheinen von oben wirklich ziemlich scheiße auszusehen
Und die Jugend macht sichs gerade auf der Couch bequem
Doch diese Band hier macht sich auf den Weg
Hier kommt das erste wirklich neue Ding seit einigen Jahren
Wie ein schwarzer Präsident in den Vereinigten Staaten
Hast du Angst du brauchst keine zu haben
Denn wir sind nur gekommen um dir einen zu blasen
Und zwar so

Wo sind die Helden hin
Sag mir wo sind die Helden hin
Wo wo wo wo sind die Helden hin
Sag kann es sein dass wir es selber sind
Wo wo wo wo sind die Helden hin
Sag mir wo sind die Helden hin
Wo wo wo wo sind die Helden hin
Wir sind es selbst

Album  Deine Mutter
Jedes Jahr, wenn die Blüten sprießen
Wenn sich Bienchen und Blümchen lieben auf den grünen Wiesen
Und die Züge nach Füßen riechen, wenn die Türen schließen
Merk ich, wie ich wieder diese Frühlingsgefühle kriege

Die ganze Stadt ist voller Schönheitsköniginnen
Und sogar die Vögel singen ihnen Lobeshymnen mit geölten Stimmen
Da wird mir klar, meine Liebe ist doch unbegrenzt
Wie faszinierend dieses Kunstwerk Mensch

Und dann möcht ich sie verteilen, diese Liebe, die ich hab
Wozu der ganze Neid, die Intrigen und der Hass?
Denn egal ob fett und weiß, oder abgemagert und schwarz
Am Ende sind wir alle gleich, wie die Lieder in den Charts

Wir haben nur so wenig Zeit, von der Wiege bis ins Grab
Und verschwenden sie mit Scheiße, wie Terminen oder Schlaf
Wer hat eigentlich gesagt, dass man mit Liebe seine Miete nicht bezahlt?
Ich kauf ein Eis und siedel um in den Park

Denn, wenn du ein Mensch bist
Hab ich Liebe für dich
Wenn du ein Tier bist
Hab ich Liebe für dich
Wenn du ein Baum bist
Hab ich Liebe für dich

Ich habe... Liebe, ja, Liebe, ja, Liebe

Wenn du ein Mensch bist
Dann hab ich Liebe für dich
Wenn du ein Tier bist
Hab ich auch Liebe für dich
Wenn du ein Baum bist
Dann hab ich Liebe für dich
Du bist ein Whack MC?
Ich hab keine Liebe für dich

Ich kann nicht jedem Menschen Liebe geben (oh)
Diesen Zustand erreich ich auch nicht mehr in diesem Leben (oh)
Momentan bin ich eher miesepetrig (oh)
Und das liegt wohl an diesem ekligen Nieselregen (oh)

Jeder sucht nach Liebe, das ist nicht zu widerlegen (hey)
All you need is love, ich lege die Beatles auf (hey)
Aber das Leben unterrichtet dich mit tiefen Schlägen (oh)
Esst mehr Tofu-Schnitzel, lasst die Tiere leben

Oder macht's doch so, wie die Chinesen
Fresst eure Katzen, hab gehört, die haben sieben Leben (hey)
Ich würde das auch tun, doch ich hab ne Allergie dagegen (oh)
Und noch 'n paar andere, z. B. gegen Bibel lesen (oh)

Dabei muss ich schon sagen, Nächstenliebe mag ich gerne (hey)
Würde sogar den Papst umarmen, wenn's nicht so'n Arschloch wäre (oh)
Was, das sind nur Vorurteile? Ich?
Ich habe keine Vorurteile, nur die Russen haben Vorurteile

Ja, ich bin ein Hippie, nur kein Bock, mich so anzuzieh'n
Komm in den Kreis, wir spielen zusammen Tamburin
Freie Liebe und friedliche Fantasien
Wir springen den ganzen Tag auf einem riesigen Trampolin

Yippie yeah, jeder umarmt seinen Nebenmann
Und gibt ihm soviel Liebe, wie er gerade geben kann
Und wenn der Sommer auf sich warten lassen sollte
Tanzen wir eben den Regentanz

Wenn du ein Mensch bist
Dann hab ich Liebe für dich
Wenn du ein Tier bist
Dann hab ich Liebe für dich
Wenn du ein Baum (ein Baum) bist
Dann hab ich Liebe für dich
Ich habe sehr Liebe viel Liebe

Wenn du ein Getränk bist
Dann hab ich Liebe für dich
Wenn du ein Bier bist
Dann hab ich Liebe für dich
Wenn du mit Schaum bist
Oh Mann, das wär so großartig
Aber wenn du ein Beck's Lemon bist, dann
Bitte stell dich nicht in das Regal zu den anderen Bieren
Und tu so, als würdest du dazu gehören,
Arschloch!

Hkrm, hey, äh...
Habt ihr Liebe für mich
Dann, dann gebt mir mal

Ein oh yeah (oh yeah)
Ein whow yeah (whow yeah)
Ein hoh yeah (hoh yeah)
Ein ohh yeahh (ohh yeahh)

Und dann ein oh, oh, yeah, yeah (oh, oh, yeah, yeah)
Gebt mir mal ein oooh yeah (oooh yeah)
Ein who-oh-oh yeah (who-oh-oh yeah)
Ein wow yeah (wow yeah)

Album  Who Can You Trust?
Wenn du den Wahnsinn spürst,
wenn du deinen Kopf verlierst,
das Hirn mit dem Herz in die Hose rutscht
und du knabberst, beißt und lutschst.
Wie du willst, kannst du sein,
du kannst kratzen spucken schreien,
wie in den allerersten Jahren,
als wir noch dumm und glücklich waren.

Ich will alles nehmen und geben.
Das ist jetzt und das ist hier - und das sind wir.
Wir erfinden eine neue Welt aus brodeln und beben.
Wenn irgendwas gut ist, dann das hier.

Wenn du mich berührst,
dein übergroßes ich verlierst,
nimm mich mit, ich warte schon
auf die alles heilende Explosion.
Ich will dich endlich küssen,
will nicht mehr denken müssen,
was ich gelernt hab endlich vergessen
ich will dich fressen!

Ich will alles nehmen und geben.
Das ist jetzt und das ist hier - und das sind wir.
Wir erfinden eine neue Welt aus brodeln und beben.
Wenn irgendwas gut ist, dann das hier.

Nie waren wir so stark, nie waren wir so wach.
Wir haben alles und wollen mehr, mehr, mehr
Nie waren wir so stark, nie waren wir so wach.
Wir haben alles und wollen mehr, mehr, mehr, mehr, mehr

Ich will alles nehmen und geben.
Das ist jetzt und das ist hier - und das sind wir.
Wir erfinden eine neue Welt aus brodeln und beben.
Wenn irgendwas gut ist, dann...

Alles nehmen und geben! - Wenn irgendwas gut ist, dann das hier!

You nailed him up, now you tear him down
Your head held high, your heart so proud
Too blind to see the evil in you
Once a week you flock like fools

Your god is dead

You nailed him up, now you tear him down

Too blind to see the evil in you
Once a week you flock like fools

The new morality of thought control
Says "you can't argue with what you don't know"
Reaching deep inside and pulling out your soul
Leading the blind through empty salvation

You nailed him up, now you tear him down
Your head held high, your heart so proud
Too blind to see the evil in you
Once a week you flock like fools

I feel like a windshield smashed in a bus car crash,
Hurricane came smash, and it's smash and crash...
Full of glass.
Oh my god, I cut my ass!

You're running all alone.
The streets are your own.
Where did everything go?
Where did everything go?

You're running all alone.
You're on your way home.
Where did everything go?

Unreligious treasures.

Victim of a violent society of lies!

Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
Cuz I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc
I slob knobs like I was on the street
Felonious, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, 8th Day in the street till I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playin' for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here

First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail
Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech
Uh

Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
We gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you see over from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm...

I'm going to kiss the girls, make them cry
Live too fast, still not die - before I get old
I'm going to see you raised above this place
Watch the moments shine upon your face
Before I get old
I'll watch the sun set over every sea
From every city wall, every mountain peak
Before I get old
The Northern Lights and the Southern Cross
The harvests and the miles of dust
And the blowing wind across the world
So wrap this coat around yourself
And leave what's done behind
There's so much left for us to do
And yet there's so little time
I'm going to pull the fences to the ground
Watch the twisted towers come crumbling down
And start again
I want to be a hero and a villain and a father and a son
Take care of my body and abuse it still
Until everything goes numb
So let's make this dance and never fear
That there's any real reason why we're all here
Live real fast, still not die
Before I get old

Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse
The world is big enough for both of us
The pack's been shuffled now - we've got different hands
There's different enemies for both of us now
There's no one round here who remembers those times
When we were little kings of our own different sides
Was I the punk who stole your thunder
Or was it all just the other way round?

Ch: Now it's gone, done, the feud is over
Funny how vendettas just turn into a bore
Gone, done, the feud is over
I really can't be bothered anymore

Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse
The world is big enough for both of us
But oh how that bitching was fun while it lasted
Until I got to realise no one really cared

Ch: Now it's gone, done, the feud is over
Funny how vendettas just turn into a bore
Gone, done, the feud is over
I really can't be bothered anymore

It's such a waste of my time, thinking of you
And all the stuff that I hear which may or may not be true
I never did like you, probably never will
But I bet you can live with that fact pretty well
People get to drinking, they get sentimental
Maybe I'm a bastard human after all
Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse
The world is big enough for both of us
The pack's been shuffled now - we've got different hands
And this whole thing is just ridiculous

Get up early every morning
Just to put your makeup on
The wardrobe's full of useless clothes
Your winter coats are gone
The jackal pack is feeding
The motorway sweeps down
The council tries to bribe the rich
Just to stay in town

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain

Ysidro down to Melbourne
The pressure starts to build
The bullets fly at random
When you least expect they will
Everybody feels guilty
So anyone can pay
I'm just surprised it doesn't happen every bloody day

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain

So here come the nineties
The temperature is rising
I cannot seem to lose the stains
When I wash my hands
One world is rising
One world is dying
And one has got its precious head
Buried in the sand

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain

Ch: We scream, you run - fall out
You scream and we're gone - falling out
There must have been times in the smoke and the beat on the dance-floor
When all of the doors, they were opening for you
There must have been times when you thought you were kings of the whole world
With the chemicals eating away at your reason
But now you're shut down, closed in
We build our own little jails
I've had to watch this thing so many times
Another little death of innocence
Ch: Now, we scream, you run - fall out
You scream and we're gone - falling out

None of us saw the clever image you hold of yourselves
The things that you thought were so cool were just a joke to everyone else
Didn't they tell you when you pulled a stupid expression
That when the wind changed you'd be stuck with it forever?
And now you're shut down, closed in, with all the money you owe
I've had to watch this thing so many times
Another little death of innocence
Ch: We scream, you run - fall out
You scream and we're gone - falling out

One swallow never made a spring
You can buy a crown - it doesn't make you king
Beware the trinkets that we bring

When the visionary dreams set hard and grey as flesh made into stone
You tore the statues to the ground crying - let my people go
And now they're gone, all is gone
But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile

The freedom passion and the two faced call
They dance together upon the wall
With nothing left to break the fall

Now twenty-five miles north in the great dark woods
The college buildings stand
And the ghosts of hope walk silent halls at the death of the Promised Land
All is gone, all is gone
But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile

And in the shadows of the crowded square, a thousand paper deals go down
And hungry sharks from everywhere smell the blood and head for town
Innocence starts to peel away - How money changes everything
The past it eats the future up and this blind desire eats everything

Now the rats they leave one stricken ship for another sailing past
Your world was going nowhere slow while ours goes nowhere fast
And now it's gone, all is gone
But these changing winds can blow cold and hostile

Across the flatlands we came out of nowhere special
Like a peasant revolution - makeshift weapons in our hands
We crashed the gates so hard we'd never heard that kind of sound before
And braced ourselves for victory and the spoils of the land
Defences melt away before our frozen blank surprise
From the palace now we stare into a million waiting eyes
Ch: I've got my trophies on the wall, the heads I've hunted down the hall
And I guard my winnings well, carry them with me when I fall
Now the daylight hours pass like the people I have lost
In the triumph of the hour, in the bloody cause - lust for power

Like a vision she dances through the shafts of light
Everything I've ever dreamed about focused true and bright
And fortune opens up the ground, blackens out the sky
I kissed her once, I kissed her twice but I couldn't remember why
When I was young they taught me well to always play to win
But they never said what happens when you've won the bloody game
Ch: I've got my trophies on the wall. . .

And all desire is satisfied but still the hunt goes on
It's funny how this feeling stays with all the reasons gone

We've seen them fat and bloated those who once could hold a flame
I've run for home and words gone by but nothing seems the same
I can watch the world in secrecy from one side of this glass
From the other my reflection and I don't know which is worse
The streets are lined with glittering stores and a million fatted calves
I can catch myself sometimes these days and all I do is laugh, laugh
Ch: I've got my trophies on the wall . . .

The rains move in eastwards, in waves of succession
Drawing lines of grey across the sky
With history just as close as a hand on the shoulder
In hunger and impatience we cry

The battle against corruption rages in each corner
There must be something better, something pure
And the call it is answered from the caves to the cities
Come the dealers of salvation on Earth

We've seen the restless children at the head of the columns
Come to purify the future with the arrogance of youth
Nothing is as cruel as the righteousness of innocence
With automatic weapons and a gospel of the truth

Revolution forever, succession of the seasons
Within the blood of nature, all raised to rot and die
This purity is a lie

Now immaculate conception in sterilised laboratories
How the vanity goes on
Or in the message of the preacher with his morals and obsessions
The wars that we wage upon ourselves

Purity is a virtue, purity is an angel
Purity is for madmen to make fools of us all
So forgive yourself my friend, all this will soon be over
What happened here tonight is nothing at all

Revolution forever, succession of the seasons
Within the blood of nature, all raised to rot and die
This purity is a lie

I will always see Brendan at that broken down piano
His fingers thick and red, shaking on the keys
Battered by the years of alcohol and working
Still playing with the faith that never leaves

So sit us down, buy us a drink, tell us a good story
Sing us a song we know to be true
I don't give a damn that I never will be worthy
Fear is the only enemy that I still know

You walk the thinnest of the ice, so easy to hurt
We drove through the dark in the pouring rain and barely said a word
So dress your wounds as best you can and close your tired eyes
Try to climb away from here towards the empty skies

And I'll meet you there, high above it all
In the kiss of air, the lover's breath
Visions rise from each little death

As Moses stands and turns his gaze away from the feuding tribes
Walks towards the mountains and through the rocks he climbs
God, he orders Moses, "Bring the people to my will"
"Leave me be," cries Moses, keeps on walking up the hill

And I'll meet you there, high above it all
In the kiss of air, the lover's breath
Visions rise from each little death

And should the Devil come and should he say
"All of this will I give to you, if you just bow down and worship me"
I'm on my knees

"The white twisted clouds and the endless shades of blue in the ocean make the hum of the spacecraft systems, the radio chatter, even your own breathing disappear. There is no cold or wind or smell to tell you that you are connected to Earth. You have an almost dispassionate platform - remote, Olympian and yet so moving that you can hardly believe how emotionally attached you are to those rough patterns shifting steadily below."

I'll teach you everything that I know now, Eddie
If you really want to take the time
But don't expect to get answers to anything, Eddie
There is just one thing I've learned
Through everything that I've done and tried
Everything I have justified
It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all

I always drive like a madman, Eddie
But you'll soon get used to that
I believe if you're moving fast enough, Eddie
You don't ever have to watch your back
I choose solid ground to make my stands
I stay off the streets at closing time
It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all

Remember how it was out at Bunglass
We climbed up to the peak and stood against the rocks
The photographs came - you couldn't see us
We were lost against the mountains like specks of dust
And the mirror never lies, it's just these foolish eyes
And we all see what we want to see
What we need to see, what we have to see
And so will you do just the same one day, Eddie
I've been to that place a thousand times
Looked over the edge so many times
Wanted to jump a thousand times

Well we talk about saving the world now, Eddie
It's our vanity gone mad
She'll survive us all perfectly well
When we're all long buried and dead
Clever monkeys with technology
Barely out of the caves and the trees
It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all
Eddie now let it go . . .
I turn my head away from here
Down towards the rolling seas again
I kneel and worship where I can
The ground comes swirling up and through these veins . . .

I felt a shiver in the heat-haze and the waiting time is over
Strange tongues on the airwaves as the voices call from distant lands
I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other
And I'm in love with every strange unfolding day
As the storm begins to break cover
So let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below

And so we shutter up the doorways as the ripples move towards us
For a moment stop breathing - She wakes and stirs beneath our feet
The Order try to stand their ground, while every battlefront is shifting
They still believe that they can hold the reins
But then they've got no sense of history
So let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below
- the waters seething, bubbling out of control
- come on take my hand and we'll dive

A television blares in an empty room
The poisoned waters glisten
Goliath staggers round in a punch-drunk daze
Doesn't understand what hit him
I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other
And I'm in love with every strange unfolding day
As the storm begins to break cover
Let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below
- the waters seething, out of control
- we watch the oceans rise and the governments start to fall
- across the freezing skies until the lights go out below

Jetzt nur nicht die Chance verpassen
Auf der Suche nach dem nächsten Satz
Damit wir nicht im Regen stehen bleiben
Auf dem beleuchteten Parkplatz

Stolper ich, verhaspel mich und
Fall vor dir auf die Knie
Du sagst das mit dem Glücklichsein
Ist relativ

Und plötzlich wird meine Hand von deiner gehalten
Und plötzlich will ich irgendwann mal alt werden

Jetzt nur nicht den Moment vermasseln
Beim Warten auf den nächsten Satz
Du kramst im Gehen den Hausschlüssel raus und sagst
Frag mich noch mal wann anders

Und plötzlich wird meine Hand von deiner gehalten
Und plötzlich will ich irgendwann mal alt werden

Dann stolper ich, verhaspel mich und
Fall vor dir auf die Knie
Du sagst das mit dem Glücklichsein
Ist relativ

Und plötzlich wird meine Hand von deiner gehalten
Und plötzlich will ich irgendwann mal alt werden

Album  Kein Mensch ist Illegal
You told me
to move on.
Not to be so tragic
You told me to listen
But all I hear is static

Wooo why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting
Wooo why I'm even waiting
Wooo it feels like I'm just fainting

I love you
and you love me
Baby you just forgot to call me
I love you
and you love me
Baby you just forgot to call me

Wooo-o why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting
Wooo-o why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feel like I'm just fainting

I waited for your call
but I waited too long
I just keep listening
to your answering machine

Answering machine
Answering machine
Answering machine

Wooo-o why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting
Wooo-o why I'm even waiting
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting

I. "WHITE LANDS OF EMPATHICA"

The end.

The songwriter's dead.
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of Empathica
Of Innocence
Empathica
Innocence


II. "HOME"

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell

One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

My home was there 'n then
Those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world

III. "THE PACIFIC"

Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free

Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the pain, beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

"I'm afraid, so afraid.
Being raped again, and again, and again
I know I will die alone.
But loved.

You live long enough to hear the sound of guns,
long enough to find yourself screaming every night,
long enough to see your friends betray you.

For years I've been strapped unto this altar.
Now I only have three minutes and counting.
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me a death I always longed for."


IV. "DARK PASSION PLAY"

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned, upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world

"Today, in the year of our Lord 2005,
Tuomas was called from the cares of the world.
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day.
The music he wrote had too long been without silence.

He was found naked and dead,
With a smile in his face, a pen and one thousand pages of erased text."

Save me


V. "MOTHER & FATHER"

Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love

Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end
I will always love you

The beginning.

I surrender the attack
Nevermind the killing
Dazed and numb, stripped to the core
Our moment was stolen
Time has won
Wounded souls
Our moment was stolen
Time has won

Beyond memory
Faces I see
Mean nothing to me
Only shadows in my dreams
Beyond memory
Why is it me?
And no one can see?
Only shadows in my dreams

Fake it
I surrender to the fight
I can see the darkness in your eyes
Down to the bone
Your victim was chosen
Time has won
All along
Your victim was chosen
Time has won

Beyond memory

Mean nothing to me
Only shadows in my dreams

You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night, free

I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number two

Wake up, wake up, wake up your heart and come alive

You could steal my car
If only I had one to drive

Drive through the night
Through the midnight air
Screeching and speeding
In the streetlamps' glare

We come alive

There's still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland

There's still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland

Turn on, turn on, turn on your smile and come alive

You could wreck my car
If we only both could survive

Bumper-to-bumper
The fumes start to choke
Coughing up the secrets
Of this innermost joke

We come alive

I first saw you
Without love but then you knew
Your fingers reached
I moved in, the distance breached

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

To my surprise I kissed you
You made me rise
Now by my side, I've missed you
And let it slide

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

If all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
If the things that I said, they just weren't true
Ascend, ascend my friend

I turned my head and looked back
I had been led
When my heart jumped, we lost touch
Our love had slumped

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

If all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
If the things that I said, they just weren't true
Then don't restrain from coming here
It causes pain, you're so sincere
Ascend, I must ascend

So now alone
I find out your heart is stone
A helping hand?
There is none from where I stand

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

If all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
If the things that I said, they just weren't true
Then don't restrain from telling me
That all this pain is good for me

I can see you looking down to keep away from me
But I'm stuck with this lack of ability
I can't refrain from coming here
It causes pain, you're so sincere

Family man

He's a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the ten commandments
Either pushing rock, selling for cock
Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

Seeing ass fly by
In a drive by
Fly by night
He'll give you a fright

Taking out your cash
He'll stuff it in his stash
Leaving by the back door
Settling up your old score

He's a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the ten commandments
Either pushing rock, selling for cock
Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

He knows it all so well
From a spell in the cell
Now can't you tell
This is hell but just think of the cash

And the friends you can smash
If they're crossing your path
You'll get the last laugh
As you're driving away

Yes it's been a good day
To die as you try
To get by
Buy to get high

And he'll lend so that you spend
Your life will depend
On your money made friend
Your friend 'til the end
He knows no wrong from right
Best keep out of his sight

He's a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the ten commandments
Either pushing rock, selling for cock
Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

Yeah, and you know his girls love him too
Even when you're dropping your goo
And you think well, if the judge only knew
But then, do you really think that he hasn't been there too

With his leather strap clap trap
And a dolly bird sitting on his lap
Her fingertips trips across him like on a road map
Leading down to his old chap

(Ha-ha)

Talk about about love
And talk about trust
I know it's hard to believe this is us

Talk about hate
Talk about distrust
Tell me every time this has to be discussed

Go tell your mother
And your father too
Go tell your brothers, I think your sister knew

How will we know
When you are done and I am undone?
(I am undone) (how will we know?)

Lay one more time
On this blood stained sheet
The soft ground is where our hearts would meet

Tied and tangled
By everything we've done
Just lie still and we can wait for the sun

How will we know (how will we know?)
When you are done and I am undone?

How will we know (how will we know?)
When you are done and I am undone?

Endlich hat es aufgehört, zu regnen
Und nur das junge Laub verliert noch manche Träne
Über uns
Ein Parfüm von feuchter Erde
Das letzte Tageslicht
Die Hände feucht und kalt
Vom Pflücken zarter Blumen
Die schwer und so gebeugt von zu viel Nass
Doch langsam kommt ihr Duft zurück
Wie lange?
Frag ich dich
Denn sterben werden sie in unsren Händen
Jetzt, wo sie entwurzelt sind durch mich
Für dich
Doch schweige still, antworte nicht
Wir wollen nicht die Stille auch noch töten
Noch nicht
Lausche nur dem süßen Duft des klammen Frühlingsabendlichts
Und
Atme

Der letzte Herbst war mir ein ein Starren aufs Schafott
Der letzte Herbst war mir ein Mord an einem Gott
Der letzte Herbst war mir ein gnadenloser Blick
Des Henkers der mich auf mein schwaches, knöchernes Genick

Der letzte Winter war mir ein tiefes, kaltes Grab
Der letzte Winter war mir ein Traum, den es nie gab
Der letzte Winter war Erwachen in der Nacht
Schutzlos und nackt und zitternd um den Schlaf gebracht

Alles in mir schreit nach Leben, ich war viel zu lange tot
Ein Frühlingsregen tilgt das Übel, welches Lächeln mir verbot
Doch wo in mir sind jene Worte, die da öffnen jene Türen
Die mir deine Augen zeigten, die zurück ins Leben führen...;
Hinter diesen Augen liegt ein See, so tief und ohne Hast
Und alles soll ertrinken, was ich meuchelte, was mich nun hasst
Ich weiß, ich werde niemals mehr so unbeschwert wie damals sein
Doch Lethe weint diesen tiefen See, so wasche er mich rein...;

Es sinkt die dampfende Sonne leis' in nebligen Schlaf
Es regt sich Bedauern im Herzen, wo mein Scheitern mich traf
Denn es wecken verstummte Ruinen so viel schlafendes Gestern
Es ruht, wie die Tränen um früher, junger Regen auf Gras
Es schmiegt sanft sich Moos an Ruinen, die ich niemals vergaß
Doch ich spüre mein Herz wieder schlagen
Das gefroren war

Lasse dein Flüstern im Wind mit dem Rascheln
Der noch jungen, wiegenden Blätter verschwimmen
Eins werden Atmen und Abend und Blicke
Und Worte der sehnsüchtig wispernden Stimmen

Nach kalten Jahren...;
Ich entsinne mich der Glut des Blutes unter Haut
Noch ist mir die Wärme von Geborgenheit vertraut
Ruinen
Tempel

Ich sitze stumm auf starrem Stein mit kaltem Staub in meinen Augen, während draußen vor der Gruft der Sommer tanzt
Ich wälze Chroniken, in denen steht, dass ich einstmals gelebt, doch dann hat sich mein Herz in diesem Grab verschanzt
Mein Schädel pocht wie voll geronn'nen Blutes, und doch leer wie ein Verlies, wo ungehört mein Hilferuf verhallt
Das Siechtum sitzt wie feuchter Moder in den Gliedern, doch ich werde aufsteh'n, noch ist der eig'ne Tod zu kalt

Ich bin der Wind, der deine Kerzen flackern lässt, wenn du alleine bist und glaubst, ich wüsste keinen Pfad zu dir
Ich bin der Schatten, der an deinen Wänden tanzt, wenn du schon lange schläfst und träumst von einem Kratzen an der Tür
Du bist das Blut, das mir die Sinne schwinden lässt, wenn es die Lippen mir benetzt, du hast den Durst wieder geweckt
Dein Lachen hallte bis hinab in meine Gruft, und wer mich ruft, der träumt von mir, all deine Träume sind befleckt

Es fließe Blut!

Mein denken tropft verträumt wie Honig, und das Glas in meiner Hand
Es träumt von Rauchgold und der Sonne, starr zerfließt die bleiche Wand
Dort draußen auf dem See treibt viele Stunden schon der Mond dahin
Und schenkt der Herbstnacht fahle Blicke voller Weisheit ohne Sinn

Der Geist in zähem Honig
In trunken süßer Nacht
Wäre Blut für einen Brief, doch der See ist schwarz und tief
Und voll der schweren Worte
Die warten auf Geburt
Heute nicht, doch irgendwann spült der See sie sicher an

Wünsche glüh'n am Firmament, wann immer ich mich dorthin wende
Manchmal stürzt ein Stern herab und fällt verträumt in meine Hände
Heute Nacht kann ohne je zu stürzen ich mich fallen lassen
Während Sterne weiterziehen und am Horizont verblassen

Vielleicht bist du die Sonne, die mich morgen am Horizont grüßt
Vielleicht das Licht nach Nächten voller Leere, das den Tag versüßt
Vielleicht ist alles nur ein Traum, vielleicht ein vorbestimmter Lauf
Ich weiß, die Sonne geht an mehr als nur an einem Morgen auf

Von draußen greift der junge Herbst wieder nach den einsamen Herzen
Hebt nun eure Gläser, lacht, und spürt wieder der Sehnsucht Schmerzen
Denn solange Wunden pochen, Narben unsre Seelen zieren
Fließt noch Blut und strömt noch Geist, so lasst uns etwas Zeit verlieren

They provide their nectar and then I am released.
I am a grain of sand,
underneath the floor and so far out of reach,
but I am safe from harm.

Against this shelter they are always hammering.
Against these ears they are always deafening.

I too know an angry language.

Our pain is always,
accurate and striving to evade,
its only design.
It wants to strike you down,
to fall into its arms again.
Blood is thicker than water,
but which one did you drink?

What I know was divided and broken down,
by the ignorance of others.
Spoken from their lips,
but with the lungs of another.
Sounds great,
but tastes like blood.

These rumor sessions are assembled by us all... by us all.
They are the earth and we are the breath of life.

Your pain is always,
accurate and striving to evade,
its only design.
I want to strike you down,
to fall into my arms again.
Blood is thicker than water,
but which one did you drink?
Did you drink?

Put down that retribution.
I don't need your absolution.

We'll be legends
We are smashed men, still moving
We've tried everything in the book
No stranger to failure, death with a steady heartbeat
Scratching into any surface it wants
Joy and beauty rejected so many times
A world of hurt, a heart of false hope

And while we thought that we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Our hopes and dreams, our worst nightmares
Our worst nightmares have now come true
Tonight when this deep sleep falls on men
Driven by an instinct more powerful than life itself
From horror to hope, from hope and devastation

And while we thought that we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Overfed and unconcerned
It came with teeth and claw
Oh, hated form of emotion
You have become so obvious
My friend, the fatal habit of being myself

Ok, there's hope, step down with all your friends

And out of place
I believe its time for me to move for forward,
When I break through

This time I'll, make you,
Proud to see me overcome all day life,
Proud of, who'd you raised,
Your shelter, your peacefulness

So this time I'll make you proud

Proud of, who you raised up,
You know that I will,
Always be here till' the end

Come back, so I, can say, thank you for this,
Home cooked meals, and a place to rest,
My troubled head when you're away,
I've passed the test, I've earned an A,
Not just in school, but in life,
You'll always be right by my side,
To help me show, hope to all,
That are lost and sick in this dying world,
I'll use the love you left behind,
I'll change their minds, I'll change, their, minds

I hope, I hope you smile,
When you look down on me,
I hope, you smile

This can't, we won't know,
I hope that I make you proud

This is not, what it is, only baby scars, (Those baby scars)
I need your love, like a boy needs his mother's side (Well I need your side)

It's like loving a lion that cannot be tamed
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name
Pulling teeth from my stomach, you've been eaten alive
My blood fills your lungs, my soul you're inside

My feet they stand on ashes
From the fires that you've made
Burning bridges
Just to save your face

If I say I wouldn't be hostile (Hostile)
Could you say you would do the same? (Do the same?)
If we're all made just a little bit broken (Broken)
Tell me who is to blame, tell me who is to blame

I'm sensing a feeling, picking wounds of regret
That left alone, there's no scarring, I'll dig and I'll dig
Scratching and itching, I'll keep biting my lip
From this pain that I'm feeling, picking wounds of regret

A cut cannot heal
Unless you leave it alone
I'll open mine daily
Leaving bones exposed

Exposed

If I say I wouldn't be hostile (Hostile)
Could you say you would do the same? (Do the same?)
If we're all made just a little bit broken (Broken)
Tell me who is to blame, tell me who is to blame
To blame

Standing on ashes from the fires you've made
Burning your bridges just to save your face

Wounds of regret

If I say I wouldn't be hostile
Could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken
Tell me who is to blame, tell me who is to blame

Did you ever contemplate when all was lost you hesitate and nothing seems the same?
Have you ever hid your face, in such disgrace, decisions made, a picture with no frame?

Can you hold on? One more day?

Say you're okay, I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away.
Fight the pain, it just feels like forever is crashing down on me (down on me, me, me).

Rain will fall. Wash all the pain. It shields the soul, you turn the page to face another day.
Let me know that you will wait and I will pay for my mistakes to feel the sun again.

Can you hold on?

Say you're okay, I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away.
Fight the pain, it just feels like forever is crashing down on me.

Don't let go, time will heal.
Just don't let go,
One day we can try to start again.

If I could shake the world
If I could turn back time
Would you still be there?

I can't stop thinking about the way
I left you sinking with no escape
Now there's no lifeline, no way to save
But maybe next time I won't throw it all away

I ask myself everyday

If I could find the words
If I could shake the world

Would you still be there? (Be there?)
If I could find the words to say
If I could shake the world to break you down

Suffocating in my mistakes
I lost my halo when I fell from grace

When your reflection in the mirror
Smiles back it lies, you know it
When you lay your head to sleep at night
It's filled with every moment
Every chance you miss to be something
Well learn from your mistakes
You're not alone you're with me

You're not alone you're with me

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

When it feels like all is lost
And there's no guide that's left to prove it
Take a look inside, cherish your life
And live before you lose it
You're all waiting for the answer
Keep on searching, strength in numbers

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

At the end of the day, what will you choose?
Will you keep moving on or be forced to lose?
Look inside of yourself 'cause the power's in you
There is always hope, you're not alone

Hands held close to his face, screaming, "Why do I bother?"
They'll just tear me down, rip me apart
Cast aside like a sinner with no words from the wise

Will you ever learn?

Learn to listen?

Can you hear them calling?
You'll testify to justify, you have to find a way
Can you hear them calling?
With arcane eyes you're staring back at someone with no face
Can you hear them calling?

She lies there in wait and feeling so hollow
Can't find love in this place, left alone with her sorrow
All the promises you made when you stood by her side
Were so broken when you threw it away

I'd rather burn alive than drown inside your reality

Just how broken and empty and disgraced
You seem to be (To be)

You cut me out and dragged me down
Pulled me all the way to the bottom
I've done for you, till black and blue
What no one else would do for the fallen

One day when nothing ever feels the same

You hit the wall and lost it all

I was all for you,
You fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.

Here's a story, just bare with me,
Met a drug that changed my life.
Something like a classic movie,
Just one look, all stopped with time.

Let her in through these very veins,
Coursing through these tired bones.
Numb my body, healed my heart,
Soothes my mind, and eased my soul.

These are the memories between us,
Let it go, and let live again.

I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.
I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.

You let me live, believing all your life.
You let me live your lie, live your lie.

You let me believe, and live your lie.

Guess I should have seen this coming,
Should have known it all along.
You're a fake, see clear right through you,
Left me dying, it's all your fault.

These are the memories between us,
Let it go, and let live again.

I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.
I was all for you, you fell over my love,

I gave you everything, and you just throw away.
Know what I deserve, know that I should let,
Let you go...;

Let you go!
This is me, letting you go...;

I was all for you, you fell over my love,

Now I'm left with thoughts of suicide...;

Let you go, you're killing me.

Instant paper compromise
Audience still survives
Underneath the bloody cape
Audience still escapes

Feeling torture on the page
Audience comes of age
Fucking donkeys, right diseased
Bleeding years, never pleased

The eyes can't protect you through
The compromising eye
Swore allegiance to
The light

Wicked paper aspirates
Audience fearing hate
Over top what's underneath
Audience is in defeat

Free to worry, keep the peace
Audience in disgrace
Someone's knocking on their knees
All he says, "Can't release"

The eyes will protect you through
The compromising eye
Swore allegiance to
The lie

The flies, self-protection proves
The compost-smelling piles
To pass on over to
Our future

Ich sehe nur gute Menschen
Überall nur gute Menschen
Alles ist einfach, bist du einfach gestrickt
Kein Knoten im Kopf, nur ein Faden am Genick
Und dann ab Richtung Glückseligkeit
Ein Leben im Korsett
Ein guter Mensch verdrängt was er nicht weiß

Damit sich gute Menschen nicht länger als Opfer fühlen
Lernen sie von Kindesbeinen an: Roboter spielen
Ellbogen raus und auf Opfer zielen
Nach oben buckeln, sich einen goldenen Cock verdienen
Nur glückliche Orangen in der Saftpresse
Sogar der Mett-Igel lacht in ihre Hackfresse
Ein guter Mensch muss tun, was ein guter Mensch tun muss
Luxus und Ruhm, rumlutschen bis zum Schluss

Ich weiß nicht was ihr seht, ich seh' nur gute Menschen
Alle lieben Kinder, alle gehen Blut spenden
Und das letzte was man hier noch vermisst
Ist die Antwort auf die Frage warum alles bleibt wie's ist

Ich weiß nicht was ihr seht, ich seh' nur gute Menschen
Alle lieben Kinder, alle gehen Blut spenden
Und das letzte was man hier noch vermisst
Ist die Antwort auf die Frage warum alles bleibt wie's ist

Weiche Strafen für gewaltbereite Ausländer, no go
Nein sie sind keine Nazis, auch sie trinken Kaffee Togo
Auch sie waren schon im Urlaub, wo es Schwarze gab
Und am Vatertag lief sogar Roberto Blanco
Der ein wunderbarer Neger war, wo ist das Problem?
Kinderschänder müssen sterben, voll ok
Böhse Onkelz auf der Heckscheibe stehen
Mit Deutschlandfahnen schwenkend durch die Straße gehen
Alles nur gut gemeint, aus Angst um ihre Blutsbrüder
Sie sind das Volk, alles nur besorgte Wutbürger
Stammtisch-Modus, jetzt wird laut diskutiert
Schwarz, Rot, Grün, alles wirkt braun meliert
Was, was homophob? (nein, nein, nein, nein, nein)
Sie sind da für kranke Menschen, auch Schwule kann man heilen
Eine Hand wäscht die andere rein
Brownies backen für die Hochzeit, Mohrenköpfe teilen
Und wenn im Sportlerheim die erste Strophe erklingt
Und das Brüderlein singt, ist das überhaupt nicht schlimm
Niemand schiebt hier irgendjemand ab
Alle lieben Aydin Döner - beste Soße der Stadt

Ich weiß nicht was ihr habt
Ich sehe nur gute Menschen, die nichts Böses wollen
Nein, die nur an unsere Zukunft denken
Und wahrscheinlich werden sie es nie verstehen
Warum ich kotzen muss, wenn ich sie seh'

Ich weiß nicht was ihr habt, ich sehe nur gute Menschen
Alle lieben Kinder, alle gehen Blut spenden
Und das letzte was man hier noch vermisst
Ist die Antwort auf die Frage warum alles bleibt wie's ist

Du bist so hässlich und grau,
ich glaub du stehst auf Beton.
Ich bin immer noch in dir drin,
bin gerade eben erst gekommen.
Doch lass kein Wort auf dich kommen,
an welchen Ort ich auch komm.
Ich wiederhole mich...
Egal, du schreibst für mich die besten Songs.
Bei dir tauch ich ab,
du spritzt mir Wasser ins Gesicht.
Ich werde wieder angespült,
als obs nichts anderes gibt.
Die Nase ist verstopft,
vielleicht habe ich Allergie
Auch wenn ich die Nase voll hab,
weiß ich immer wie du riechst,

Du hast mir alles gegeben,

Denn ich hab ein Schiff im Hafen,

Album  Kein Mensch ist Illegal
Vielleicht nur heiße Luft, wahrscheinlich ausgebrannt
Vielleicht auch zeitgemäß und wir sind gar nicht Schuld daran
Dass niemand mehr von uns für irgendetwas brennen kann
Legenden sterben jung, die meisten Stumm und Arm
Und erst in hundert Jahren, Zeit zu überlegen
Ob das Leben eine Scheibe ist, wenn du es weißt, geil für dich
Wir lachen nicht, heben es auf
Irgendwann wird unser Himmel schon blau

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Können wir das Ende nicht sehen

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Können wir das Ende nicht sehen

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Haben wir auch kein Problem

Und wir springen, sehen uns auf die Fresse fliegen
Doch lieber fliegen, als Seidenhemden gerade Bügeln
Nicht mal Ansatzweise, unsere Kragenweite
Lieber voll verkacken als schon im Ansatz scheiße
Zelebrierte Langeweile
Große Worte, keine Taten
Kleine Fische, großer Magen
Weiter warten und in 70 Jahren:
Der wohlverdiente Stempel auf dem Masterplan

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Können wir das Ende nicht sehen

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Können wir das Ende nicht sehen

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Haben wir auch kein Problem

Oder was ist das Problem?
Haben wir ein Problem?
Was ist dein Problem?
Was ist dein Problem?

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Können wir das Ende nicht sehen

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Können wir das Ende nicht sehen

Denn am Ende wird alles wieder gut
Und solange es uns nicht gut geht
Haben wir auch kein Problem

Deine Welt liegt dir zu Füßen auf dem Flur,
du gehst raus.
Deine Augen auf dem iPod...
Nicht gesehen, du trittst drauf.
Scheiße! Superdumm gelaufen,
die Sneaker bleiben hängen,
genau im Mittelpunkt der Welt,
denn sie ist einfach zu eng.

Und was jetzt? hmmm...
Du rufst deine Eltern an,
ob sie dir helfen können,
weil du es nicht selber kannst.
Dir fehlt die Nadel, n Faden und auch n Klebeband
und keien Zeit für Stress.
Klar, dass du es nicht regeln kannst.
und mieser Empfang,
niemand geht ran.

Basteln war noch nie dein Ding,
das passt nie wieder zusammen.
Die Welt in deiner Hand
ist wie ein Sneaker ohne Bein.
So wie Rappen ohne Reim...
Es läuft einfach nicht gut.
Was ist los Junge?
Zeig mal Einsatz.
Ein Satz reicht aus.
Und du weißt...
Das hier ist nicht deine Welt,
ein Satz reicht aus.

Du schaust mich an als wär ich ein Analphabet
Versuch's dir zu erklären: A B C E egal, eh nicht so wichtig
Scheißegal, du bist eh nicht so richtig bei mir

Lass uns sagen es ist eh nichts passiert.
Lieber Ego polieren als ewig frustriert
Ein müdes Lächeln nur das Mittel zum Zweck
Lügen haben lange Beine, sie gehen schneller weg

Häng' mich in Phrasen auf
Und tritts du gegen den Stuhl, wär' ich cool damit
Wär' auch cooler für dich
Geht nicht, auf halbem Weg gescheitert
Du bist immer noch bei mir
"Geh nicht", geht weiter

Und schon wieder dieses kopfzerfickende Gefühl
Dieses "Ich will nicht dass du weißt, dass ich nicht weiß was ich will"
Und ich Idiot, hol' deine Tasse aus dem Schrank
Brüh alles nochmal auf und halt den Kaffee für dich warm
Verdammt!

Und ich Idiot halt' den Kaffee für dich warm, verdammt!

Ohne Milch und Zucker, keine gefälschten Bilder
Ungefiltert, runter auf Ex
Ich hab gesagt ich halt' den Kaffee für dich warm
Die Hoffnung tropft zuletzt

Wie pathetisch diese Worte klingen
Und wenn wir ehrlich wären würden wir sofort merken
Alles fake, alles ohne Sinn
Du ziehst am Filter deiner Kippe, schaust mich an
Rauch sie tot - 'ne warte ich zieh selbst noch einmal dran,
Verdammt!

Und schon wieder dieses...
Und schon wieder dieses, kopfzerfickende Gefühl
Dieses, "irgendwie passt es schon
Ja vielleicht auch nicht", irgendwann, irgendwann
Und schon wieder dieses kopfzerfickende Gefühl
Dieses "Ich will nicht dass du weißt, dass ich nicht weiß was ich will"
Und ich Idiot, hol' deine Tasse aus dem Schrank
Auch wenn du erstmal nicht mehr kommst, halt' den Kaffee für dich warm
Verdammt!

Ich halt' den Kaffee für dich warm, verdammt!
Ich halt' den Kaffee für dich warm, verdammt!

Und schon wieder dieses erbärmliche Gefühl, dieses
Unglaublich beschissene Irgendetwas!
Dieses unglaublich erbärmliche..., dieses
Leidenschaftlos hurensohnmäßige Gefühl des Nichtstuns!
Dieses unglaublich kaputtschlagende hirnfickende Etwas!
Und ich Idiot halt' den Kaffee für dich warm
Ich halt' den Kaffe für dich warm!

Du bist so hässlich und grau,
ich glaub du stehst auf Beton.
Ich bin immer noch in dir drin,
bin gerade eben erst gekommen.
Doch lass kein Wort auf dich kommen,
an welchen Ort ich auch komm.
Ich wiederhole mich...
Egal, du schreibst für mich die besten Songs.
Bei dir tauch ich ab,
du spritzt mir Wasser ins Gesicht.
Ich werde wieder angespült,
als obs nichts anderes gibt.
Die Nase ist verstopft,
vielleicht habe ich Allergie
Auch wenn ich die Nase voll hab,

Ich saug dich auf
Du mich aus
Du lässt mich fallen
Ich heb' dich auf

Ich wart auf dich
Ich dreh am Rad für dich
Ratschläge bringen nichts
Bringen mich eh niemals weg

Ich lauf dir hinterher
Du sagst kein Wort
Doch viel viel viel mehr

Ich verschwende mich in dir
Verliere mich, vergesse mich für dich

Tanz ich auf Knien
Ich hab's so gewollt und so hab ich's verdient

Was für'n Alptraum
Oh Gott Alptraum
Hör mich an
Immer noch Alptraum
Ich sing für dich
Nur für dich sing ich
Für dich
So tief sink ich für dich
Rauche, feier, trink für dich mit
Und schreib kitschige Songs
Weil ich weiß dass danach noch was Richtiges kommt
Richtige Songs für immer ergeben
Gebe mich auf nur um für dich zu leben

What can I say?
When every word you won't believe anyway
No promise made
Just means there's nothing wrong today

What can I do?
Cause I could never make things up to you
And we both new
That if things don't change it'll all be thrown away

Don't break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there's another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

What can I hide?
When every feeling's locked down deep inside
My hands are tied
But I'm hangin' on
And I'm hangin' in

Don't break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there's another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

Sure do like the sound of it
Sure do like the sound of it

Don't break my fall
Don't break my

Don't break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there's another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

Don't break my fall
Don't break my
Don't break my

Album  Joyride
Open your shelters and let us all in
Tired and homeless are hungry again
Outside my window at fountain and vine
Drunks and the addicts are forming a line

Sharing their stories to comfort dispair
Carry the weight of the crosses they bear
Praying for courage and wisdom to change
Serenity costs more than pocket book change

I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls
I want to turn all the tables
And give back what doesn't belong to me, yeah

Sleeping on sidewalks is how people live
Begging for something no one wants to give
Size of your wealth is a bottle of wine
Sipped with your friends you'll soon leave behind

Are your children in flames,
Incarcerated and bound by the chain?
Strangers paralyze
Down in the gutters of fountain and vine

I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls
I want to turn all the tables
And give back what doesn't belong to me, yeah

Feel like running away, like running away
Tired of seeing them falling aside
There's no running away
I'm running, I'm running away

I want to tear it all down
Build it all up from the ground
I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls on me

The view from down here
Brings mention to mind
Everything's sacred on fountain and vine

Don't, don't it make you sad
To lose the things you love
For what you never had?

Don't, don't it make you cry
To feel the broken time
And always wonder why?

Don't it make you feel like your hands are off the wheel,
Like your hands are off the wheel?
Don't it tear you down, don't it turn your world around,
Don't it love to let you down?

Don't, don't it make your day
To gather up your strength
And feel it slipping away?

How, how much can you take
Before you fall apart,
Before you start to break?

Don't it make you feel like your hands are off the wheel,
Like your hands are off the wheel?
Don't it tear you down, don't it turn your world around,
Don't it love to let you down?

Close your eyes, it's only no surprise you're not alone.

Don't it make you sad to lose the ones you love?

Don't it make you feel like your hands are off the wheel,
Like your hands are off the wheel?
Don't it tear you down, don't it turn your world around
Don't it love to let you down?

Don't it make you feel, don't it make you feel
Like it's carrying you down, down, down, down...
Like your hands are off the wheel,

It's a corner that you turn,
It's a lesson that you learn in time.
It's a worry that you feel,
Another scar that you conceal from sight.

Have I been away too long
For me to say?
Have I been away too long
For things to change?

From a runaway train.
Caught beneath the wheels
Of a runaway train.

Every moment of the day
I feel it crumbling away, if I...
I only have myself to blame
For all the cracks within the frame that I find.

Have I been away too long
For me to say?
Have I been away too long
For things to change?

From a runaway train.
Caught beneath the wheels
Of a runaway train.

Now I know how it feels
To be a runaway.
To be a runaway, hey yeah
To be a runaway, yeah

It's all right
It's okay
It's all right

Confessor of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the everlost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic
Under the waning moon

It is the year of death
Wielding his instruments
Stealth sovereign reaper
Touching us with ease

Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease
I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
This doesn't concern me yet
Still far from the knell
Taunting their bereavement

Mob round the dead
Point fingers at the details
Probing vomits for more
Caught in unbridled suspense

We have all lost it now
Catching the flakes of dismay
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
You're plucked to the mass
Parched with thirst for the wicked

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark
The sun sets forever over Blackwater park

Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding on the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight

Break of morning
Coldness lingers on
Shroud me into
Nightmares of the sun

Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here?
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears

Plunging towards
Bereavement
Faster yet
Clearing thoughts
My mind
Is set

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me

You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away

Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Help me
Cure you
Atone for all you've done
Help me
Leave you
As all the days are gone

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me

You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away

Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Night falls again
Taking what's left of me

Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need

Stay with me a while
Rise above the vile
Name my final rest
Poured into my chest

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourners lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Pledge yourself to me
Never leave me be
Sweat breaks on my brow
Given time ends now

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourners lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Spirit painted sin
Embers neath my skin
Veiled in pale embrace
Reached and touched my face

Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
(Release your grip, let me go into this sight)
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourners lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Please remedy my confusion
And thrust me back to the day
The silence of your seclusion
Brings night into all you say

Pull me down again and guide me into pain

I'm counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again and guide me into...

There is failure inside
This test I can't persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criterias demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder

Ooh, puzzled by shrewd innocence
Runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves
Nails bleeding from the struggle

It's the end for the weak at heart
Always the same
A lullaby for the ones who've lost all
Reeling inside
Gleaming eye in your necklace reflects
Stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away
Never again

Spiraling to the ground below
Like autumn leaves left in the wake to fade
Waking up to your sound again
And lapse into the ways of misery

You wait by the window
Morning's breath on the sill
Idle hands given another try
So you wait and you savour the moment
Outside the canvas turned white
Ruby eyes in the fog

Rain washing clean all the sins
A liquid gown that covers all
Your loathe turns endless
Opened mirage soothes your sense
Locked on the pinnacle
The best secret within

Like a derelict child
Heart burning for a stranger
Ascending to the meek
Flock round the liars in awe

Caked in the soil beneath
Fear me when we meet
Turn away in admiration
My firm grip round the nucleus of joy

Enough of this
You will leave me now
You will see it now
Perish at my hands

Close to you
Tangled up in hair
Fresh stigma look
Shall I take you with me
And it is cold
Ruby eyes in the fog
It is me

And you are just like them all
Stained by the names of fathers
I'm greeting my downward fall
Leaving the throes to others

And you are just like them all
Stained by the names of fathers
I'm greeting my downward fall
Leaving the throes to others

We entered Winter once again
Naked, freezing from my breath
Neath the lid all limbs tucked away
This coffin is your abode from now and onwards

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

I am beyond death
Midst a dreaming affinity
Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in its splendour

Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days

In the wake of this relief
Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at its peak
Love me to my death

Lost are days of Spring
You sighted and let me in
Keep the beast inside
Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin

Your gaze covered in virgin snow
Rigid features
It's the shallow deeds who is to blame
Deafening shrieks pierced the night

A step from oblivion
Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie
It was worth it for the wait alone

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

Dispose of severed skin

There's nothing painful in this
There's no upheaval
Redemption for my pathos
All sins undone

Awaiting
Word on what's to come
In helpless
Prayers a hope lives on
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised
In the rays of the sun
I am longing for the darkness

Buried alive

In the corner
Beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason
I'd never notice
A memory that could hold me back

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know
You'll never return to this place

Gone through days
Without talking
There is a comfort
In silence
So used to losing
All ambition
Struggling to maintain what's left

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know
You'll never return to this place

Once undone
There's only smoke
Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up
What really happened
Force the darkness unto me

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place

I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading, I try to forget you as you forgot
Me, this time there is nothing left for you to take, this is goodbye

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I
Should step out of the rain
Turn away

Close to ending it all I am drifting through the stages of the rapture born within
This loss, thoughts of death inside tear me apart from the core of my soul

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I
Should step out of the rain
Turn away

At times the
Dark's fading slowly
But it never
Sustains
Would someone
Watch over me
In my time of
Need

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I
Should contemplate this change

And I

Blank face in the windowpane
Made clear in seconds of light
Disappears and returns again
Counting hours, searching the night

Might be waiting for someone
Might be there for us to see
Might be in need of talking
Might be staring directly at me

Inside plays a lullaby
Slurred voice over children cries
On
The inside

Haunting loneliness in the eye
Skin covering a secret scar
His hand is waving a goodbye
There's no response or action returned

There is deep prejudice in me
Outshines all reason inside
Given dreams all riddled with pain
And projected unto the last

Lost control, Moved out of the role now

Soul sacrifice
Forgot the advice
Lost track of time
In a flurry of smoke
Waiting anxiety
For a fair judgement deserved

I'm still beneath in the soil

Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil

And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls

Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Depending on the life blood

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Silently
Whispering
Move in me and set me free

Album  Deliverance
Floating on mist
Crept up the caverns of my brain
Receiving no warning
From nothing to a life code

Walk with me, you'll never leave
Wait to see your spirit free

Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea

Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my face grip
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep

From love to death
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night

The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me

All over now
Forgotten why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for new disease
Biding time
Looked inside insanity

It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed

The devil guides the day
Tells me what to say
Pours himself inside
And snuffs the final light

Deliverance
Thrown back at me

Deliverance
Laughing at me

There is a voice calling for me
There is a light coming down on me
There is a doubt that is clearing
There is a day that is dawning
There is a wound that is healing
There is a season waiting for me
There is a road that is turning
There is a fire still burning
A sickness in me
Constant pace towards the end
The need is stronger
This time the need is deeper
There is a peace I am searching
There is a freedom I'm depending on
There is a pain that's never ending
There is a rain falling only on me
There is a dream I am living
There is a life I'm dreaming of
There is a death I'm awaiting
There is a home I am deserting
I hold my breath and wait
Only moments remain
Movement for departed hope
Effect for absent friends
Sever the faith from my body
Leave me begging for more
Take what I have and deliver me
Into everlasting sleep
Soothing trance
Colours fade
And disappear
Ethereal light
Showing me what I can do without
In a motionless scene
There is only me
I take what I can
Controlling you to get ahead
Fading away
And leaving
Long for sleep
Closer now
Lead the way into death
Every wretched dream
I've left behind
Every waking hour
I lie in wait
Sucked inside by will
Gone into the flood
All my questions unfurled
As I was put to the test
Once I'm below there's no turning back
Plunging into the deepest void
Departed shell left drained behind
Pacing roads unknown
Searching for a new home
Desert in my eye
Barren lands inside

Falling inside again
This nightmare always the same
Still never enough
Halting at the brink of discovery
Moving into the darkness
Leaking inside to cover up
Dragging me down and under
Entangled and undone at once
Old memories
I'm not in need but wish to know
What are the tragedies
The history behind the walls
Pacing further down
Familiar children's laughter
Dissonant and out of time
And their eyes are dead
Watching myself in a pool of water
Wearing the mask of a ghost
Smeared all across my skin
Rotten earth and insects
Endless night
Always preserving the calm
Movement behind
Bleeding animals in a field of fire
There is no absolution
Death is but a fairytale
They are mere visions
They are afraid of me
Clear insight
A smoke is rising nearby
Dust covering my coat
Blend together to spell my name
Pale, covered me with sweat
There are no words left
Sole provider of death
Distorted faith in myself
Human harvest burning
Blackest pages turning
Twisted perception come true
Captured in dreams connected
Staring right back
Spiritual decay - Still seeking
Frozen in time
Mourn this departure - All watching
Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning
Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning - Returning

Name  Atonement
Artist  Opeth
Album  Ghost Reveries
Haunted nights for halcyon days
Can't sleep to the scraping of his voice
Nature's way struck grief in me
And I became a ghost in sickness

Willingly guided into heresy
Beneath the surface, stark emptiness
And you'd pity my conviction
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader

You'd cling to your pleasant hope
It is twisted fascination
While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair
And I'm praising death

Lost love of the heart
In a holocaust scene memory

Decrepit body wearing transparent skin
Inside, the smoke of failure

Wept for solace and submit to faith
In his shadow I'm choking
Yet flourishing

Master

A delusion made me stronger
Yet I'm draped in pale withering flesh
I sacrificed more than I had
And left my woes beneath the mire

Ghost of Mother
Lingering death
Ghost on Mother's bed
Black strands on the pillow
Contour of her health
Twisted face upon the head

Ghost of perdition
Stuck in her chest
A warning no one read
Tragic friendship
Called inside the fog, uh
Pouring venom, brew deceiving

Devil cracked the earthly shell
Foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said:
"You have to live before you die young"

Devil cracked the earthly shell
Foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said:
"You have to live before you die young"

Uh, holding her down
Channeling darkness
Hemlock for the gods
Fading resistance
Draining the weakness
Penetrating inner light

Road into the dark unaware
Winding ever higher

Ha ya ya ya ya ya
Ha
Ha ya ya ya ya ya
Ha
Ha ya ya ya ya ya

Ha ya ya ya ya ya

Darkness by her side
Spoke and passed her by
Dedicated hunter
Waits to pull us under
Rose up to its call
In his arms she'd fall
Mother light received
A faithful servant's free

In time the hissing of her sanity
Faded out her voice and soiled her name
Like torn-out pages in a diary
Everything seemed clean that is unstained
Incoherent talk of ordinary days
Why would we really need to live?
Decide what's clear and what's within a haze
What you should take and what to give

Uhh!
Ghost of perdition
Saint's premonition's unclear
Keeper of holy hordes
Keeper of holy whores, uhh!

To see a beloved son
In despair of what's to come

If one cut the source of the flow
And everything would change
Would conviction fall
In the shadow of the righteous?
The phantasm of your mind
Might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten morals
Where the victim is the prey
Ha!

Found a way
To rid myself clean of pain
And a fever that's
Been haunting me
Has gone away

Looking through my window
I seem to recognise
All the people passing by
But I'm alone
And far from home
Nobody knows me

Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
All days are in darkness
And I'm biding my time
Once I am sure of my task I will rise
Again...

There's a sense of longing in me
As I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's

Lost
In isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read
"I'll die alone"
I know she's aching

There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain
Next to his name
She
Knows he's gone

And isolation
Is all that would remain
"The wound in me
Is pouring out to rest
On a lover's shore"

I hear the baying of the hounds
In the distance. I hear them devouring
Pest-ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self-loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies
Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness
That cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into its pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country
The cities lay dead beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death-burden
So you take comfort in him
And you are receptive to stark wishes
No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware and in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing

Drown in the deep mire
With past desires
Beneath the mire
Drown desire now with you

Lined up verses on dead skin
The tainted lips of a stranger
Resting upon hers

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone
I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror
Finding the outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet
Endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour
Awaiting a reverie to unfold
Louder by the minute
The baying of the hounds
Calling me back to my home

Pour yourself
Into me
Wield your power
Martyr's price
Stare me down
To the ground

The eyes
Of the devil
Fixed on
His sinners

Slake my thirst
Eternal wealth
Heathen key
Round my neck
This poetry
Of blasphemy
Know the sounds
Of infamy

The hands
Of Satan
Assembling
His flock
Pale horse
Rider
Searching
The earth

Whispered conjuration, a belief takes form
Choking hand tapping the veins in your throat
His orders in your mouth, a decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom, spins the undertow of hate
Injected seeds of vengeance, usurper's eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom beckoning in the mist

The grand conjuration

Tell me why
Love subsides
In the light
Of your wish
Say my name
Ease the pain
Clear the smoke
In my head

It was all true
A parlour strode, and the night sets forever
I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen

Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form "because"
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave

We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember...

How I drape my face with my bare hands
The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help
The folded message that wept my name

Shadows skulk at my coming
We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page
The tainted dogma

Time grows short
As the piper plays his tune
We are almost there

You are beyond all help
Dancing into the void
We are almost there

In the name of desperation
I call your name
A lamentation I sigh
Again and again

Spiritual eclipse
The gateways are closed for me to seek

The night...
A veil of stars, watching
My shadow is born from light
The light of the eye, in darkness

Over troubled waters memories soar
Endlessly, searching night and day
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill
With the calmness of a whisper

I wear a naked soul
A blank face in the streaming water
It is cold in here
Frost scar my coat with dust

Eyes attach to your mute portrait
We spoke only through thoughts
Together we gazed, awaited
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun

Sunbirds leave their dark recesses
Shadows glid the archways

Do not turn your face towards me
Confronting me with my lonliness
You are in a forest unknown
The secret orchard
And your voice is vast and achromatic
But still so precious

Lullaby of the crescent moon took you
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face
Granted you a hollow stare
Another soul within the divine herd

I have kept it
The amaranth symbol
Hidden inside the golden shrine
Until we rejoice in the meadow
Of the end
When we both walk the shadows
It will set ablaze and vanish
Black rose immortal

It is getting dark again
Dusk shuffle across the fields
The evening trees moan as if they knew
At night I always dream of you

The deceased awake from beyond their sleep.
Search for blood and mortal meat.
Maggots crawl out from their eyes.
Feel their pain, it's mournful cries.
Pull your veins, tear out your heart.
Consume the blood, feast on flesh.
Torn apart, intestines scattered.
Alimentary canal ripped and shattered.
Pieces of your body eaten.
Painful death as time stands still.
Where your mind bursts in torture.
Feel your soul be torn apart.
Demons crawling through your system.
Hell has risen, the gods of pain.
Rip your skin, burn your bones.
Internal organs torn and drained.
Smell of flesh burnt to ashes.
Cries of death from hell.
Pain is all you revolve around.
Where the souls of Satan's grounds.
Rooms of eternal torture, reveal endurance of endless pain.
Disintegrating mortals, bodies burn.
There you feel the hellish torture.
Hellish torment, brutal butchering.
Demonic creatures revolve in torment...

I arose from the lullaby
Enduring yet another tale
You tempt me again
With your embrace, so tainted
Within the night you beckon
Cursing me with every glance

Bring me through
Carry my empty shadow
And guide me inside your warped labyrinth
To the well of sin
I swear I will always love you

Leave me speechless
Release my yearning
The soil I walk is clad with light
Drifting moons thrust me with their rays
And I fall inside

I lament this heritage
Cannot bid farewell
The pale face...you went as far as you could
And from that moment
I witnessed your beauty, fealt your death

Mine is yours, mine is yours

In the wake of dawn
The mist of morning linger before it leaves
Invisible eyes, red reflection
It is you
Smiling in the midst of the moor

And so you left us
Jaded and gaunt, some September
Wilted with the seasons
But hidden inside the delusion
I saw your eyes, somewhere

Devoid of death
The aura poises amidst (the storm)
In solid tears I linger
A parlour glade, moonlit sorrow

Lonely resting pools
Relics of the moon-dogged lake
Whisper: "All your words are misgiven"

Am I like them?
Those who mourn and turn away
Those who would give anything
To see you again
If only for another second

Your face was, like the photograph
Painted white
We did not speak very often about it
What does it matter now?

Cloak of autumn shroud
I gaze, dim ricochet of stars
I reckon it is time for me to leave

You sleep in the light
Yet the night and the silent water
Still so dark

The sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came you lied
Embracing us over
Autumn's proud treetops

I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
Your voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again

Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes
I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered:
"I know..."

We walked into the night
Am I
To bid you farewell?
Why can't you see
that I try?
When every tear I shed
Is for you?

Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

Cold wind blows

I, once upon a time
Carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye
A broken rhyme I had underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

A sorrow in me

I saw a movement in their eyes
That said I no longer knew the way
I had given up the ghost
A passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail

Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You have taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you

Riding through the fields of sorrow

När jag tänker på den ständiga resan
Genom livet
När det alltid känns som höst

Då vänder sej vinden sakta mot norr
Och blommorna dör
Det faller regn i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst

När jag vandrar på den steniga vägen
Genom livet
När det känns som jag bar på en sorg

Då gömmer sej solen sakta i moln
Och ordet är adjö
Snart faller snö i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst

Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Caused me to linger on a piece of text
Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
Then someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, "Thank you"

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here

Slow days
Slow words
Slow lies
Slow ends

So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams no more

Slow pain
Slow deaths

And again he rides in, it's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish
Hunter
A thousand lies, cast from the throne of secrecy

Hear him spewing forth meaning to miserable lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust
Believer
Your body a vehicle to house his disease

Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king
Dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow
A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes
Waiting
Spiraling judgement, provoked in the rains

This futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgement

Storing trace on your arms
So I left you alone
We all left you alone

Awaited the face of the moon to ascend

I lost all I had (that April day)
I turned to my friends (nothing to say)
I wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I wallowed in shame...

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promised to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away...

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

The liquid is in your throat
One hopeless delight

After all you fell in love with death,
Life has aborted.
All you've had and all you became,
The night is calling, you pray for it.

A barren waste is your land
Your crops, they were sown to die

The skin is a mirror
Empty eyes hollow with ignorance
Health runs from your lips
Tucked in and safe in a world of sleep

All those years caring for a liar
A benefit road that is winding higher
You're a moth too close to the fire

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all

Fleeing your sorrows
Pushing your spirit away

The weakness of the psyche
A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a savior

And cries out
For the restless will also die

A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower

O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself
I wish you had never come back for us to see the beckoning end

And the pride of a mother brought flaws in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son

Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting so clear and so true
Overheard us talking

Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known
Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye

I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care
Or thank my pops for all the talks
And all the wisdom he shared

Unaware, I just did what I always do
Everyday, the same routine
Before I skate off to school

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking a test
I took two to the chest

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running
But I couldn't hear nothing

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I didn't really know this kid
He wasn't part of the class

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
Or maybe for a moment
He forgot who he was

Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was
I know it's because

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud
But no respect for herself

She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations
Just different faces

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules
So you would think he was cool

He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end
They might remember him then

You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt
With the sound of a gat

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim
No matter what you say
It don't take away the pain

That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why
It's the blind leading the blind

I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense
Somebody's got to know

There's got to be more to life than this
There's got to be more to everything
I thought exists

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are, (we are, we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are, (we are, we are) youth of the nation

We are, we are, (we are, we are) the youth of the nation (the youth of nation)
We are, we are, (we are, we are) youth of the nation (youth of the nation)
We are, we are, (we are, we are) the youth of the nation (the youth of nation)
We are, we are, (we are, we are) youth of the nation (youth of the nation)

It's these substandard motels on the (La, la, la, la) corner of 4th and Fremont Street

Appealing only because they are just that unappealing
Any practiced catholic would cross themselves upon entering

The rooms have a hint of asbestos
And maybe just a dash of formaldehyde
And the habit of decomposing
Right before your very (La, la, la, la) eyes

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Tonight tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday

The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
Oh, wonderful caricature of intimacy

Yeah
(Yeah)

And not to mention, the constable
And his proposition, for that virgin
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on strictly business
As he said to the Mrs. Well, only hours before

After he had left, she was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash, (There was a terrible crash) between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of a different kind

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

There are no raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses

To be forgetting you in a cabaret
Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen
May even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's PA
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
Peach and lime daiquiri

Isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naïveté

Forgive our sins
Forged at the pulpit with forked tongues selling false sermons
'Cause I am a new wave gospel sharp, and you'll be thy witness
So gentlemen, if you're gonna preach
Then for God sakes preach with conviction

Strike up the band
Whoa, the conductor is beckoning
Come congregation, and let's sing it like you mean it
No, don't you get it don't you get it? Now don't you move

Douse the lights

We sure are in for a show tonight

In this little number, we are graced by two displays of character
We've got: the gunslinger extraordinaire, a walking contradiction
And I for one can see no blood
From the hearts and the wrists you allegedly slit
And I for one won't stand for this
If the scene were a parish, you'd all be condemned

Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed?
When the lights are dim
And your hands are shaking as you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim
And your heart is racing as your fingers touch his skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No no no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get these teen hearts beating
Faster, faster

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

So I guess we're back to us
Oh cameraman swing the focus
In case I lost my train of thought
Where was it that we last left off? (let's pick up, pick up)

Oh now I do recall, we were just getting to the part
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

Let's get these teen hearts beating
Faster, faster

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

Tonight, tonight, you are, you are a whispering campaign
I bet to them your name is cheap, I bet to them you look like shh...
Talk to the mirror, oh choke back tears and
Keep telling yourself, that "I'm a diva"
Oh and the smokes in that cigarette box on the table
They just so happen to be laced with nitroglycerin

Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Seems so fitting for

Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense
Of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off
It feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served

And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress
Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Seems so fitting for

Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense
Of the death of a bachelor

The death of a bachelor
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Seems so fitting for

Happily ever after
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense
Of the death of a bachelor

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough (don't think I'll ever get enough)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go out you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

It's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright
It's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though

What are these footprints?
They don't look very human like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbors pool
Upside down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now
(Don't think I'll ever get it now)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go out you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I've told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down when the sun came up
I think we've had enough

Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a hell of a feeling though
It's a hell of a feeling though

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm

This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go out you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

Welcome to the end of eras
Ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die

If it feels good, tastes good
It must be mine
Dynasty decapitated
You just might see a ghost tonight

And if you don't know now you know

I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
Oh yeah

The crown
So close I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
Oh yeah

Sycophants on velvet sofas
Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes

If it feels good, tastes good
It must be mine
Heroes always get remembered
But you know legends never die

And if you don't know now you know

I'm taking back the crown

I found a pile of Polaroids
In the crates of a record shop
They were sexy, sexy looking back
From a night that time forgot
Mhm...

Boy, he was something debonair in 1979
And she had Farrah Fawcett hair
Carafes of blood red wine
Mhm...

In the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change

We'll stay drunk
We'll stay tan
Let the love remain
And I swear

That I'll always paint you

Golden days
Golden days
Golden days
Golden days

I bet they met some diplomats
On Bianca Jagger's new yacht
With their caviar and dead cigars
The air was sauna hot
Mhm...

I bet they never even thought about
The glitter dancing on the skin
The decades might've washed it out
As the flashes popped like pins
Mhm...

In the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change

We'll stay drunk
We'll stay tan
Let the love remain
And I swear

That I'll always paint you

Golden days

Time can never break your heart
But it'll take the pain away
Right now our future's certain
I won't let it fade away

Ohh!
A moment you'll never remember
And a night you'll never forget!
Ohh!

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

My life started the day I got caught
Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency
Who was I trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it)

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

I was drunk and it didn't mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it)

No one wants you when you have no heart and
I'm sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You'll never know if you don't ever try again
So let's try
Let's try
Let's try

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love
Than if you were alone

Memories turn into daydreams
Become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts electric souls

Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?

Baby, we built this house
On memories
Take my picture, now
Shake it til you see it

And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know

That's all that really matters
I was a fool

Baby, we built this house
On memories
Take my picture, now
Shake it til you see it

And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

Those thoughts of
Past lovers
They'll always haunt me

I wish I
Could believe
You'd never wrong me

Then will you
Remember
Me in the same way

As I remember you

Baby, we built this house
On memories
Take my picture, now
Shake it til you see it

And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place

Baby, we built this house

There's no sunshine
This impossible year
Only black days and sky gray
And clouds full of fear

And storms full of sorrow
That won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons
This  impossible year

There's no good times
This impossible year
Just a beach front of bad blood
And a coast that's unclear

All the guests at the party
They're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude
This impossible year

There's no you and me
This impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak
And gin made of tears

The bitter pill is swallowed
The scar souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise
This impossible year

There's never air to breathe
There's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on
Past the dream

There's no sunshine
There's no you and me
There's no good times
This  impossible year

You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I would change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no-oh

Oh the neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no-oh

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee

Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

Just another, just another, uh-oh

You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And the black tar palms keep weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh-oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, oh-oh

The high rise lights read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change you, oh-oh
Couldn't ever try to make you leave, no-oh

Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty (and the dirty, and the dirty)

Truth is that it was always going to end
This symphony buzzing in my head
Took a market of filth
And sold it like summer

True, all of the good girls act so good
Til one of them doesn't wait their turn
Turn the memory to stone
And carve your shoulder
Hey, holy roller

If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya

Wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty

I know what it's like to have to trade
The ones that you love for the ones you hate
Don't think I've ever used a day of my education

There's only two ways that these things can go
Good or bad and how was I to know
That all your friends won't hold any grudges?
I got the final judgement

If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya

Wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty

And you've been gone so long
I forgot what you feel like
But I'm not gonna think about that right now

I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
And all our friends want us to fall in love

If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya
Wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh... The good, the bad, and the dirty

Champagne pouring over us
All my friends were glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh, victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the fourth of July

A daydream spills from my corked head
Breaks free of my wooden neck
Left to nod over sleeping waves
Like bobbing bait for bathing cod
Floating flocks of candle swans
Slowly drift across wax ponds

The men all played along to marching drums
And boy did they have fun behind the sea
They sang, (Hey!) "so our matching legs are marching clocks
And we're all too small to talk to god
Yes, we're all too smart to talk to god"

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
To us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak
Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow now it's time to hatch
Sprouting suns and ageless daughters
(Don't you know?) Don't you know?
That those watermelon smiles just can't ripen underwater
Just can't ripen underwater

The men all played along to marching drums
And boy did they have fun behind the sea
They sang, (Hey!) "so our matching legs are marching clocks
And we're all too small to talk to god
Yeah, we're all too smart to talk to god
Oh, we're all too smart to talk to god"

Allow me to exaggerate a memory or two
Where summer's lasted longer than
Longer than we do
When nothing really mattered
Except for me to be with you
But in time we all forgot and
We all grew

Your melody sounds as sweet
As the first time it was sung
With a little bit more character for show
And by the time your father's heard
Of all the wrong you've done
Then I'm putting out the lantern
Find your own way back home

If I've forgotten how to sing
Before I sung this song
I'll write it all across the wall
Before my job is done
And I'll even have the courtesy
Of admitting I was wrong
As the final words before I'm dead and gone

You've never been so divine
In accepting your defeat
And I've never been more scared to be alone
If love is not enough to put my enemies to sleep
Then I'm putting out the lantern
Find your own way back home

Lying there
With a halo in her hair she cried
There are feathers everywhere
But it's fine
You do this all the time

Crying now
Through a rusted smile she knows
This isn't how he paid the bills before
Drug farm entrepreneur

Go spin circles for me
Wound relentlessly
Around the words we used to sling
Oh, such torturous things
Always chewing up the only ones
I ever mean

If you're goin', then go
Go go go
If you're goin', then go
Go go go

Watch love
Get strangled by a kite's cold strings
Fall comes early and summer leaves
As a storm with the car keys

Spark your heels
Up against the picket fence I built
All your wishes they will sink like stones
Slowly down a lonely well

Go spin circles for me
Wound relentlessly
Around the words we used to sling
Oh, such torturous things
Always chewing up the only ones
I ever mean

If you're goin', then go
Go go go

You remind me of a former love that I once knew
And you carry a little speech with you
We were holding hands walking through the middle of the street
It's fine with me, I'm just taking in the scenery

You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends

Take a chance, take your shoes off, dance in the rain
And I was flashing around and the news spread all over town
I'm not complaining that it's raining, I'm just saying that I like it a lot
More than you think, if the sun would come out and sing with me

You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends

Come save me from walking off a windowsill
Or I'll sleep in the rain
Don't you remember when I was a bird
And you were a map?

And now he drags down miles in America
Briefcase in hand
The stove is creeping up his spine again
Can't get enough trash

He took the days for pageant
Became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits
And who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?

His arms were the branches of a Christmas tree
Preached the devil in the belfry
He checked in
To learn his clothes had been thieved at the train station
Rope hung his other branch

And at the end was a dog called Bambi
Who was chewing on his parliaments
When he tried to save the calendar business
He tried to save the calendar business

He took the days for pageant
And became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits
Who could ask for anymore?
Who could have more?

The poor son of a humble chimney sweep
Fell to a cheap crowd
So stay asleep and put on that cursive type
You know we live in a toy

You know that Paul Cates bought himself a trumpet from the salvation army
But there ain't no sunshine in his song
We must reinvent love
Reinvent love
Reinvent love

He took the days for pageant
Became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits
Who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?

We must reinvent love
Reinvent love
Reinvent love

If all our life is but a dream
Fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me

And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along
In storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes, and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page
It's chasin' off the days
Look back at boat feet
And that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me

Through playful lips made of yarn
That fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weather vanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weather vanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weather vanes my one and lonely

Sugarcane (hey moon) in
(Hey moon) the easy mornin'
Weathervanes (hey moon) my
(Hey moon) one and lonely

Sugarcane (hey moon) in (hey moon)
The easy (hey moon) mornin'
Weathervanes (hey moon) my (hey moon)
One (hey moon) and lonely

(Continues in background:)
Sugarcane (hey moon) in (hey moon)
The easy (hey moon) mornin'
Weathervanes (hey moon) my (hey moon)

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
You are at the top of my lungs
Drawn to the ones who never yawn

You are at the top of my lungs

Oh, little did she know
Couldn't let me go
Already a part of her

So, often do I need
People in between
That just can't get a hold of it

So we'll just sing it for them
Ahhh
Yeah, we'll just sing it for them

So we'll just sing it for them

It's the greatest thing that's yet to have happened
Imagine knowing me
It's the greatest thing you'd ever imagine
But you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there

Slow, leave walking to the world
Give your feet a chance
They'll do all the thinking
Toast, high until they find
Less pathetic wine
Until they get a better blend

And we'll just drink it for them
Ahhh
Yeah we'll just drink it for them

Spun the stars on her fingernails
But it never made her happy
Cause she couldn't ever have me
She said she won the world at a carnival
But she could never win me
Cause she couldn't ever catch me

I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes
I just see the sky

Well I, just see the sky

I don't love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me?
I am out of my mind
Throw an old line out to sea
To see if I can catch a dream

The sun was always in her eyes
She didn't even see me
But that girl had so much love
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time

She said she won the world at a carnival

Innocence
Sunk the glow and drowned in covers
Send for all your absent lovers things

Sheepish wolves
Looking lived in eating buttons
Wink, just don't put your teeth on me

Accidents
Let the evening in the backdoor
Filled the room ceiling to the floor

Beat backbones
Grazed the poem and made it strange
I wasn't born to be a skeleton

Go on
Grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens

Go on
Grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens

Jealous orchard
The sky is falling off the ceiling
While I'm tucking fibs into a cookie jar

Bombed reverie
It's useless searching in the cupboards
When everything you have is on your back

Go on
Grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens

Things are shaping up to be pretty odd
Little deaths in musical beds
So it seems I'm someone I've never met

You will only hear these elegant crimes
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth

And everybody gets their, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I'm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say

Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I want to go where everyone goes
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same

I never said I'd leave the city
I never said I'd leave this town
A falling out we won't tiptoe about

And everybody gets their, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Well, I'm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I won't cut my beard and I won't change my hair
It grows like fancy flowers but it grows nowhere
My hair, my hair
If I could build my house just like the Trojan horse
I'd put a statue of myself upon the shelf, of course, of course
Of course

She's the smoke, she's dancing fancy pirouettes
Swan diving off of the deep end of my tragic cigarette
She's steam, laughing on the windowpanes
The never-ending swaying haze
Oh that ever smiling maze
Oh that ever smiling maze
A ballet

Everything's gone missing, I've lost more songs to floods
I can't prove this makes any sense but I sure hope that it does
Perhaps, I was born with the curiosity
The likes of those of old crows
The likes of those of old crows
And oh how that piano knows
The piano knows something I don't know

I won't cut my beard and I won't change my hair
It grows like fancy flowers but it grows nowhere
My hair, my hair
If I could build my house just like the Trojan horse
I'd put a statue of myself upon the shelf

When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer

When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
All was golden when the day met the night

So he said, "Would it be all right
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile?"

So she said, "That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
and leave me all alone in the summer."

Well he was just hanging around
Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out
Just hanging around
Then he fell in love

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

Looks innocent, now doesn't it?
But sometimes there are dangers involved that never meet the eye
No matter where you meet a stranger
Be careful if they are too friendly

Hey, a casual affair
That could go anywhere
And only for tonight

Take any moment, any time
A lover on the left
A sinner on the right

Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush-hush, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair

Break involuntary ties
A secret so the spies
Could never find us out

Stay for as long as you have time
So the mess that we'll become
Leaves something to talk about

Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(Hush-hush, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair

I did it, I did it, I did it,  I did it,  I did it
I did it, I did it, I did it,  I did it,  I did it,  I did it again
I did it, I did it, I did it,  I did it,  I did it
I did it, I did it, I did it,  I did it,  I did it,  I did it again

We've waited so damn long, we're sick and tired
I won't leave any doubt or stone unturned
I've got a collar full of chemistry from your company
So maybe tonight I'll be the libertine

Oh, show me your love, your love
Gimme more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up
Cause there's always time for second guesses, I don't wanna know
If you're gonna be the death of me, that's how I wanna go

You've got it all worked out with so little time
Memories that I'd black out if you were mine
You've got a pocket full of reasons why you're here tonight
So, baby, tonight just be the death of me

Oh, show me your love, your love
Gimme more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up
Cause there's always time for second guesses, I don't wanna know
If you're gonna be the death of me, that's how I wanna go

I never so adored you
I'm twisting allegories now
I want to complicate you
Don't let me do this to myself

I'm chasing roller coasters
I've got to have you closer now
Endless romantic stories
You never could control me

Well, I never really thought that you'd come tonight
When the crown hangs heavy on either side
Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die
We're far too young to die
We're far too young to die

Fixation or psychosis?
Devoted to neurosis now
Endless romantic stories
You never could control me

Well I never really thought that you'd come tonight

Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die

Found another victim
But no one's ever gonna find Miss Jackson, Jackson, Jackson

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky
Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down
Looking for the time of your life

Burn my lungs and curse my eyes
I've lost control and I don't want it back
I'm going numb, I've been hijacked
It's a fucking drag

I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do

Yea, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yea, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine, yea

It's better to burn than to fade away
It's better to leave than to be replaced
I'm losing to you, baby, I'm no match

I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you

This is gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells, and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Lead away by imperfect impostors

Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Oh, the fear of falling apart
Oh, the fear, the fear of falling apart

Oh, (This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
Oh, (This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
Oh, (This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)

Put it on my back
I'll be your levy
You are taking me apart
Like bad glue
On a get well card

It was always you
Falling for me
Now there's always time
Calling for me
I am the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

I'm a fly that's trapped
In a web
But I'm thinking that
My spider's dead
Oh, lonely, lonely little life
I could kid myself in
Thinking that I'm fine...

It was always you
Falling for me
Now there's always time
Calling for me
I am the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

I'm skin and bone
Just a cane and a rusty throne
Oh, the castle's under siege
But the sign outside says "leave me alone!"

'Cause you're behind my eyelids when I'm all alone
Hey stranger, I want ya to catch me like a cold
You and God both got the guns
And when you shoot, I think I'd duck

I led the revolution in my bedroom,
And I set all the zippers free
We said, "No more war!
No more clothes! Give me peace!
Oh, kiss me!"

Hey hey, We are a hurricane
Drop our anchors in a storm
Hey, they will never be the same
A fire in a flask to keep us warm
'Cause they know, and I know,
That they don't look like me
Oh they know, I know
That they don't sound like me!

You'll dance to anything!
You'll dance to anything!

Oh I'd confess, I'd confess in a room where I'm blessed
But he didn't come and speak to me,
Or put my heart at ease
And I believe that, half the time,
I am a wolf among the sheep
Gnawing at the wool over my eyes


I led the revolution in my bedroom,
And I set all the zippers free
We said, "No more war!
No more clothes! Give me peace!

'Cause they know, (they know)

Oh they know, (they know)

That they don't sound like me

You'll dance to anything!

If I retreat
Words, wars, and symphonies
Make room we're taking over here
And you're the galentine
Cold and alone, it suits you well
You won't find me perching here again

May your feet serve you well,
And the rest be sent to hell
Where they always have belonged
Cold hearts brew colder songs
Fate will play us out
With a song of pure romance
So stomp your feet and clap your hands...

Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!

May your feet serve you well,
And the rest be sent to hell
Where they always have belonged
Cold hearts brew colder songs

Stomp your feet and clap your hands...

Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type

He was the congregation's vagrant
With an unrequited love
When your passion's exaltation
Then finding refuge is not enough

She was the youngest of the family
And the last to be let go
When they decided they would try
And make it on their own

Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Where'd you go?

When July became December
Their affection fought the cold
But they couldn't quite remember
What inspired them to go

And it was beautifully depressing
Like A Streetcar Named Desire
They were fighting for their love
That started growing tired

Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
(Don't fade away)

When the money lost momentum
And the bills were piling high
Then the smile had finally faded
From the apple of their eye

They were young and independent
And they thought they had it planned
Should've known right from the start
You can't predict the end

Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away

Oh, memories, where'd you go? (oh oh oh)
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
(Don't fade away)

I was fine, just a guy living on my own
Waiting for the sky to fall
Then you called and changed it all, Doll
Velvet lips and the eyes to pull me in
We both know you'd already win
Oh, your original sin

You fooled me once with your eyes, now, Honey
You fooled me twice with your lies, and I say

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care
She lives in her world, so unaware
Does she know that my
Destiny lies with her?

Sarah, Oh, Sarah
Sarah, Oh, Sarah
Oh Sarah (Sarah)
Are you saving me?

Waking up to a kiss and you're on your way
I'd really hoped that you would stay
But you left and went your own way, Babe
I don't mind, take your time
I got things to do besides sit-around-and-wait-for-you
Oh, and I hope you do too

Ohh, you fooled me once with your eyes, now, Honey
You fooled me twice with your lies, and I say

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care
She lives in her world, so unaware
Does she know that my
Destiny lies with her?

Sarah
Oh, Sarah
Are you saving me?

And It's killing me inside!
Consuming all my time
You've left me blind!
And when I think I'm right,
You strip away my pride
You cast it all aside,
But I say

Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care
She lives in her world, so unaware
Does she know that my
Destiny lies with her?

She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin, she's paid for

A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa, Mona Lisa

Baby animals like me don't talk anyway

Feel like an ambulance

Pray I could replace her,
Forget the way her tears taste
Oh, the way her tears taste!

Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on it's deathbed
There is simply nothing worse than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night
I will come back to life
But only for you
Only for you

The world may call it a second chance
But when I came back, it was more of a relapse
Anticipation's on the other line
And obsession called while you were out
Yeah, it called while you were out

Put another X on the calendar
Summer's on it's deathbed
There is simply nothing worse than knowing how it ends
And I meant everything I said that night

Asleep in the hive,
I guess all the buzzing got to me
Well, I'm still alive
At night your body is a symphony
And I'm conducting

You said if you don't let it out
You're gonna let it eat you away

Put another X on the calendar

Place in a smile at the perfect event,
Gracing your skin with the side of my hand.
If I ever leave I could learn to miss you
With sentimental boy as my nom de plume.

Let me save you of this wrong.

I may never sleep tonight,
As long as you're still burning bright.
If I could trade mistakes for sheep,
Count me away before you sleep.
I'll stay awake till I trade my mistakes,
So they fade away.

I fill the room in this body,
Deserted, my organs can go on without me.
You can't fly these wings.
You can't sleep in this box with me.

Let me save you of this wrong.

I may never sleep tonight,
As long as you're still burning bright.
If I could trade mistakes for sheep,
Count me away before you sleep.
I'll stay awake till I trade my mistakes,
So they fade away.

Don't let me trade you of this wrong,
Then I'll pull you in.
Cause I am an anchor, save her oar
Feel it sinking in.
Let me save you of this wrong
I am an anchor, sinking on.

I may never sleep tonight,
As long as you're still burning bright.

Count me away before you sleep.

Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

Been searching in the night
Trying to set myself free

I'm taking my life into my own hands
Got to be strong, got to be a man
Takin' my life...

Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away (take the pain away)
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine (yours and mine)

When I'm hiding, when I need it
It lets me breathe
For our handle on this life, I don't believe
This time

Would you look at me now? (would you look at me now?)
Can you tell I'm a man? (can you tell I'm a man?)
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again

Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again

Forever fooling, free and using, sliding down the slide that breaks a will (breaks a will)
Mother's angel, getting smarter, how smart are you to regress unfulfilled? (unfulfilled, yeah)
It's a damn shame

When I'm hiding, when I need it
It lets me breathe
For our handle on this life, I don't believe

If ever words were spoken
Painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life
All I wanted
Was the keeping
Of someone like you
As it turns out
Deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love (thing), love (child), love (toy)
You keep this love (fist), love (scar), love (break)
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love...

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this, the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

You keep this love (thing), love (child), love (toy)
You keep this love (fist), love (scar), love (break)
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love!

No more head trip

You keep this love (thing), love (child), love (toy)
You keep this love (fist), love (scar), love (break)
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love!

Gone are the days we used to run into the night,
oh what I'd give to do it one last time.
Against the odds with you by my side,
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]
I felt so alive, (felt so alive, felt so alive).
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]

Do we leave it behind, do we just walk away?
Drawing lines in the sand that we'd crossed anyway.
Are you looking for something more? (One careless kiss)
Two fallen lovers,
Behind these eyes it all leads to you.

Now you've turned your back on all of us,
everything we had has turned to dust.
These fractured minds and countless lies,
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]
Will be the end of us, (will be the end of us, will be the end of us).
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]

Do we leave it behind, do we just walk away?
Drawing lines in the sand that we'd crossed anyway.
Are you looking for something more? (One careless kiss)
Two fallen lovers,
Behind these eyes it all leads to you.

Now that you've gone, I'm going to take what is left.
And now that you've gone, I'm going to walk to the edge.

One careless kiss, two fallen lovers.
One careless kiss, two fallen lovers.
One careless kiss, two fallen lovers.
One careless kiss, two fallen lovers.

Do we leave it behind, do we just walk away?
Drawing lines in the sand that we'd crossed anyway.
Are you looking for something more? (One careless kiss)
Two fallen lovers,
Behind these eyes it all leads to you.

The darkness takes a hold,
another city will fall.
Another city will fall (city will fall...)
It'll take what's left of us
before it tears down the walls.
Before it tears down the walls (tear down the walls...)
We stand toe-to-toe without a second thought,
we're ready to fight,
for that's all that we've got.
With all the blood that's been shed, amongst the sands of time,
how do we make it right?
How do we make it right? (don't trust anymore)

Anoter city will fall.

I will face the horror
So that you can turn away,
turn away.
So if I carry or am carried upon my shield,
I'm still between the Devil
and the deep blue sea.

I am not alone, I stand here with my brothers, with a will of steel.
But our hands, they still tremble because,
a man's home is not here, through the smoke and mirrors,
we are men not machines, but we are just another piece.

I am cold, and I fear tonight, (and I fear...)
We won't get a second chance.

Under the cover of love,
in the darkest shadows of our hearts,
there was a fire that burned like a star,
and now my heart is a stranger,
and now my heart is a stranger.

I can see that look in your eyes,
there is a fear that this could be real,
I still taste the serpent's kiss,
when you're close, you're close to me.

And your ghosts, are calling you out
and your ghosts, they're calling you out.

Under the cover of love,
in the darkest shadows of our hearts,
there was a fire that burned like a star,
and now my heart is a stranger,
and now my heart is a stranger.

Can you stand to look in a mirror?
Can you face what's there staring back?
Or is there a fear that this is all real?
Will you step up and face your past?

I think it's time we admit who we are.

We trade glances
One look from her and she tears me apart
(Tears me apart)
I lead her through the city lights
I hold her so close I feel the beat of her heart
(The beat of her heart, yeah)

She dances in the headlights
She moves to the beat of the city
We get lost in the summer heat
We just drive like we've never felt so free

I can't resist her
She's taken a hold and she's started a fire.
(Started a fire... in my heart)
I'm helpless to answer
Her body cries out just to be loved.
(Just to be loved)
She's like no other
One Kiss is worth its weight in gold.

She dances in the headlights
She moves to the beat of the city
We get lost in the summer heat
We just drive like we've never felt so free

Never felt so free!

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it racing?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it racing?

My life is a weathered down shipwreck
Splitting at the seams, held together by memories and dreams
Every face I have seen, a stitch on my mind
On a shadow of a dream, of a dream.

And my heart is its cargo, a worn out old thing
Been dragged around this rock more times than you'd believe
To the east I call home
But the west, she is calling
From the north, to the south.

Forever I'm drifting away
With more hope than fear
Put your head to my chest and you will hear...

The sound of it beating
Is the sound of love leaving
The sound of it beating
Is the sound of the emptiness flooding in.

Flooding in...
Flooding in...
It's the sound of the emptiness flooding in.

My life, it aches
My heart, it breaks
And I can't shake the feeling all I am is sinking.

Where one thousand eyes stare back at me
But the ones that I'd die for are the ones who can't see.

Dear sky don't cry for me, cry for me,
Be the hope I could never reach.

Cold sea please don't let me sink, don't let me sink,
Wrap your arms around me and carry me home.

I stood at the shore and spoke to the ocean
I stood in the water and let my guts spill
I said,
"You and me, we're not so different
I see my reflection in all that you do..."

We both keep our secrets
We're both, oh, so blue
My heart is full of darkness
I know that yours is too...

I sat on the rooftop and screamed at the sky
I sat on the edge until I knew deep inside
Like the sky, I will always be empty
The horizon, my love - forever just out of reach.

We both keep our secrets
We're both, oh, so blue
My heart is full of darkness
I know that yours is too...

Distance was born when the sea and the sky grew apart
Loneliness was born the day
I let you go!
I let you go!

I let you,
I let you,
I let you go!
I let you,
I let you go!
I let you go!

So now I stand at the shore and speak to the ocean
I stand in the water and let...
Let my guts spill!
Let my guts spill!

We both keep our secrets
We're both, oh, so blue
My heart is full of darkness
I know, I know that yours is too!

Dear sky...

Wrap your arms around me and carry me home.

What will you tell your children when they ask you:
"What went wrong?"
How can you paint a picture of a paradise lost
To eyes that know only a wasteland?

How will you justify?
Justify - watching the world die?

The clock is ticking, can't you feel our days are numbered
Head first into disaster from which there will be no return
With narrow minds, we decimate our one true home
Cast into oblivion, judgment is calling.

Behold the pale horse
This is the funeral of the Earth
Behold the pale horse
This is the funeral.

The blind eye can no longer be cast
The clock is ticking, there is no second chance.

The blind eye can no longer be cast
There will be no future if we can't learn from our mistakes
The clock is ticking, there is no second chance
There will be no future if we can't learn.

A forced extinction closes out the age of apathy
The final act - sacrifice the world's ecology
The death of beauty, the death of hope
Cast before the throne of avarice, judgment is calling.

Behold the pale horse
This is the funeral of the Earth
Behold the pale horse
This is the funeral.

The blind eye can no longer be cast
There will be no future if we can't learn from our mistakes
The clock is ticking, there is no second chance
There will be no future, if we can't learn.

Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said "we'll save the goodbyes"
The night is young
We still have time.

In my dreams I see it ending
I see, I see the sky descending
And I let the sadness empty from my heart
Cause in my dreams I feel I'm falling
And I hear the darkness calling
Don't wake me up until the morning's light.

Because I've never felt more alive!

Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said "we'll save the goodbyes"
The night is young...

Well I never, never, never want to press rewind
Every mistake that led us here
I wouldn't change for anything.
I wouldn't change for anything.
I wouldn't change for anything.

Dear girl, there is a world that stands between us and them
See, this was never about giving up - just giving in
Because you only live once
But you spend your whole life dying
So when it all comes crashing
Know you're not alone

You're not alone...

You only live once
But you spend your whole life dying
So when it all comes crashing
Know you're not alone.

You're not alone...

You only live once
But you spend your whole life dying

There is no fear!
There is no fear!

Do you remember?
Do you remember?

Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said "we'll save the goodbyes"
The night is young...

Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said "we'll save the goodbyes"
The night is young.
We still have time.

Cause I've never felt more alive
I've never felt more alive.

Alive, alive, alive!

No comfort!
No comfort!
No comfort!
No comfort!

Fear in the face of the unknown
Born to die in a lonely world
Hostility breeds within the void
Left by the loss of understanding
Hatred the true face of ignorance
Force-fed to the masses with the promise of salvation
Knowledge controlled power withheld
In the name of one, let all blood spill.

There is no god that could love this world.

I find no comfort
In a life lived on my knees
No comfort...
Divine judgement, I could never believe.

No comfort!
No comfort!
No comfort!

I could never believe.

To live a life without regret
Is it not enough?
To love and to be loved...
Nothing lasts forever!
Nothing lasts forever!
Nothing lasts!

Superstition rules in the land of the weak
Nothing lasts forever!
Superstition rules in the land of the weak.

Fear in the face of the unknown

You want a piece of my mind?
There is no peace to find!

This is all of your doubt, repaid in kind
I am alone in crowded rooms
I am a ghost in forgotten tombs
Widow maker, you're no company to keep.

Cause you can fool some people, sometimes
But you can't fool the world for the rest of your life
You can fool some people, sometimes
But you can't fool the world...

Nobody notices! Nobody cares!
The curtain falls to no one, nowhere
Nobody notices! Nobody cares!
As the curtain falls...

Soulless - spineless
Cut from the beggar's cloth
You fill your skull with their shit till it runs from your mouth.

Heartless - carcass
I've seen more life in dead men's eyes
I've heard more truths alone with the night.

And I'd rather believe in nothing than believe in a fucking lie!
I'd sooner fail one thousand times than regret I never tried!

Cause you can fool some people, sometimes
But you can't fool the world for the rest of your life
You can fool some people, sometimes
But you can't fool the world...

You can't fool us all!

You howl at the world, but speak a dead language
You're selling your soul, but no one is buying
You pray to your gods of fashion and industry
Heads in the clouds, but you live on your fucking knees.

On your knees!

Nobody notices! Nobody cares!
The curtain falls to no one, nowhere
Nobody notices! Nobody cares!
As the curtain fucking falls...

Soulless - spineless
Cut from the beggar's cloth
You fill your head with their shit till it runs from your mouth.

Heartless - carcass
I've seen more life in dead men's eyes
I've heard more truths alone with the night.

Alone with the night!

No! No peace to find!

Born of dust and stone
Dead hearts, roaming a dying home
Life leaves us all
White bones upon the shores of time
We are but sparks in a darkened world
And yet some things were born to burn.

The napalm in your eyes
Is all my cold heart needs
If you bring the matches...
I'll bring the gasoline!

I'm the same bad news as you
You're the same kind of "fucked" as me
I'm the same bad news as you
You're the same, you're the same as me!

This soul was born for battle, my heart was built for war
These eyes see through the lies, filled with disgust.
Strip back the utopian rhetoric and you'll find a sickness at the core
A septic carcass, rotting out, filled with disgust.
We are the dead, empty lives, empty heads
Guilty is as guilty fucking does, filled with disgust.

All we have to believe are the lies that they feed us
All we have to choose is the right to obey.
Pray this time will be our mark on history,
When the shadow games and agendas are wiped the fuck away.

There is no such thing as "different shades of truth"
It's black or white, do or die, filled with disgust.
You tie your noose with your lies, but the world keeps turning
"Swing low", we cry, but the world keeps turning, turning without you.
It keeps turning without you.

'Cause all we have to believe are the lies that they feed us - born for battle!
All we have to choose is the right to obey - built for war!
This soul was born for battle, my heart was built for war.
Built for fucking war.

This heart was built for war.

Follow your heart to the water
Fill your pockets with stone
Throw your arms around me
Never let me go.

You were the first - you wouldn't be the last
What the river took, we could never replace
And as the pain set in, so did the realization
You were never coming home.

For nights we lay awake
Wishing for answers, hoping against all hope
And if love could change the course of fate
These nights, we move mountains.

But as the news filtered down the line
The impact shook us
Shook us to the core
Loss struck like a dagger in our aching hearts.

So follow your heart to the water
Fill your pockets with stone
Throw your arms around me
Never let me go.

It's not the years in your life,
It's not the years in your life,
It's not the years in your life,
It's the life in your years!

Old soul, so it's said...
The day we lost is the day I found regret
Not in the waters that embraced you
But in the wake your absence left.

Sink into me!
Sink into me!

Hold out your hands
Sink into me
Hold out your hands
I'll take you away.

Hold out your hands
Sink into me
Hold out your hands
I'll take you away.

Hold out your hands
Sink into me
Hold out your hands
I'll take you away.

Hold out your hands, sink into me
Hold out your hands, I'll take you away
Hold out your hands
Surrender the weight of this world.

Follow your heart to the water
Fill your pockets with stone
Throw your arms around me...

Follow your heart to the water
Fill your pockets with stone
Throw your arms around me
Never let me go.
Never let me go.
Never let me go.

You've gotta fight for your life
There is nothing to fear but fear itself.

The devil dances in idle minds.

Fight for your life...
Fight for your life...
Fight for your life...

I won't turn back now
This will be no slow surrender
I won't turn back now
Carpe diem - straight for the throat!

Conflict, the all-consuming pain
Time lost will never be regained
Don't waste your breath
You can't save your strength
The battle rages in the here and now!

See, every second that you waste
Is time you'll never live again.

Fight for your life!
Fight for your life!
Fight for your life!

Fight for your fucking life!

There is a price to pay -
Death is a heartbeat away

There is a price to pay -
Death is a heartbeat away

Oh!

Yeah! We build our dreams from the ashes of your nightmares
Carry our fathers sins from the cradle to the grave
We blaze our path through the darkness that you left us in
Now we ride in the belly of the beast.
We are the diamonds that choose to stay coal
A generation born to witness the end of the world.

Against the grain, against the odds, against the world
Forever the underdogs.

We are the bastard sons, we are the ones that refuse to grow cold
We are the thorn in your side, we are the thieves in the night
And we're coming to take what's ours.

No regrets.
No regrets.
We inherit the sins of the father, now reap the vengeance, no regrets,
We inherit the sins of the father, now reap the vengeance. Go!

From the ashes of your nightmares
From the cradle to the grave, we blaze our path through the darkness that you left us in
Now we ride in the belly of the beast.

We are the diamonds that choose to stay coal
A generation born to witness the end of the world,
Born to witness the end of the world.

In a moment I'm lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out

Dead eyes speak in volumes
But our lips refuse to move?
Could this ever be the last time
The final time that we see this through?

Give me the strength to return
Return the breath you've stolen
Give me the means to reset (reset)
Her heart I've broken again

Reflections built upon sorrow
We're walking the darkest road
Within chests carved with regret

In a moment I'm lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out

From the inside out
The inside out

We've been running blind
Now we're falling through the cracks

We're left running
We are running blind
Now we're falling
Falling through the cracks
Into the world of the dead

Her shining eyes (her shining eyes)
Her shining eyes mark our return
Back to the world of the dead

In a moment I'm lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out

My love I left
My heart I left
With my promise to return
A promise to return
A promise to return
A promise to return
A promise to return

Brothers, my brothers
Is this all that we are
Sisters, my sisters
We've been crushed by the fists of god

Welcome to the free world
Where nothing's as it seems
Tell me, can you find a cure
When you can't see, and you can't feel the disease
Can you seek a higher truth
When you're living on your knees
Where freedom grows from blood soaked soil
In the lands of hypocrisy

Because if you can't see the chains tell me what use is a key
It's cash, blood and oil, in the age of the refugee
They're trying to buy our minds, we ain't selling
Bang, bang, bang, hear they're nailing down the coffins

Cut the strings, feel your heart start
Cut the cord, crack this code of silence
All our lives in the hands of tyrants

Crushed by the fists of god, crushed

We've been crushed by the fists of god

To the left I see the rats and to the right I see the snakes
In my ear they're whispering sweet sermons of cruel hate
So do you buy the fear, or do you buy the lies
Tell me, what will set us free
Do we kneel before the crooked few
Or do we bite the fucking hand that feeds

When death casts no shadow and hope carries no weight
Rise into the light and feel the shackles fade away
They fear what we know, We know how they break
Bang, bang, bang, drop the hammer of conscience

Cut the strings, feel your heart start
Cut the cord, crack this code of silence, all our lives

Crushed by the fists of god, crushed

We've been crushed by the fists of god

We're just waiting for the sky to fall
Yeah I'm just waiting
Feels like all our lives we've been waiting for the sky to fall
Feels like all this time we've been

Destroyer

We speak in lies, we speak in tongues
We'll see our damage done
We live in dreams, we rest in peace
Content to sleep in our chains
Seven trumpets sound their discourse, nine circles of our devise
Messages writ within our columns of fire
No life blooms from the ashes of ire

But our hearts beat faster, and our heads hang low
Still we kneel for the masters
Filthy pigs all in a row

Black the sun
Hide us from what we have become
Black the sun
Hide us from the monsters we've become

Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy

We're all addicts hooked into a toxic culture
Infinite growth in a finite world
Empires of gold return to sand
As silver tongues rust beneath the guilt of man

But our hearts beat weaker, and our heads now roll
Still we crawl for the masters
As we beg for the killing blow

Black the sun
Hide us from what we have become
Black the sun
Hide us from the monsters we've become

We scar the earth to spite the sky
Then burn the trees to feed our fires
We are the blind leading the damned
A wrecking ball in the hands of a mad man

Destroy, destroy, destroyer
Destroy, destroy, destroyer

Hide us from what we have become
Black the sun
Hide us from the monsters we've become

Keep the flame alive

Hope for the hopeless, a light in the darkness
Hope for the hopeless, a light in, a light in the dark

The chains set to break your soul, day by day
You know the choice you have to make, freeze up and fade
Or be the flame that lights the way

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Get up, get up
One life, one shot, give it all you got

You've got one life, one shot, give it all you got

Ill's got a vice grip, like ice running down your spine

Rise, rise, rise, rise, it's all or nothing
Rise, rise, rise, rise, it's do or die

Seit vier Tagen wach,
keine PIlle nur der Kopf
will nicht still stehen,
seit Dein Platz leer ist.
Seit vier Tagen dann...

Und "All"? "All" singen
"She'll be my ex
until I get her back
until I get her back again..."

10 000 Sonnen klar,
meine Aussicht ist nicht gut, Frau,
und Deine viel zu klein
und außerdem geklaut,
und außerdem geklaut...

Du hast gesagt, Du brauchst mich anders,
Du hast gesagt, es sei nicht schwer,
dann wirf ins Feuer meine Lieder,
und wirf mich einfach hinterher...

Tot ist die Queen! Der DJ lebt und
kurz vor Panik spielt er gern sein Lieblingsstück,
das alle kennen, das alle kennen,
das alle kennen, doch ein Folk Song ist das nicht.

Das ist nicht meine Zeit, ich will sie gar nicht haben.
Es geht voran, zwölf Stunden Schicht, gereizter Magen.
Hast Du den Takt gefunden? Magst Du das Pumpen?
Es schlägt in Dir, doch Dein Herz das ist es nicht.

Die Geister, die man ruft, werden auch bei Regen bleiben,
der größte Trick des Teufels war es, sich so klar zu zeigen.
Das Laufrad läuft am besten, wenn man es gleich selber tuned.
Das ist schon fresh, aber manchmal nicht genug.

Sand zu Öl, Mut zu Fleiß,
denn ohne Arbeit wärst Du viel viel viel zu klein.
Noch was mit Wachstumsglauben? Was würde Yoda machen?
Ich kenn ihn nicht, doch ich weiß, er würde lachen.

Und diese Feier kann uns alle noch von hinten sehen,
wenn wir mittendrin zu Fuß nach Hause gehen.
Und die Moral der Geschichte ist halt wie sie ist,
wenn DJ's hängen, dank ich nicht allein den "Smiths".

Ja die Smiths, ja die Smiths, ja die Smiths.

Mein Kopf tut schon weh und mein Bauch tut's auch
Dämonen kennen meinen Namen
Ich werd verrückt, bitte hol mich raus

Raumanzug kaputt, ohne Handtuch dann nach Hause
Der erste Tritt war noch nicht so schlimm
Und überhaupt lag's wahrscheinlich nur am Wetter

Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space
Somewhere far away in space and time
Staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky
We're marooned on a small island, in an endless sea
Confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape
But tonight, on this small planet, on Earth
We're going to rock civilization

It seems like you're waiting for nothing
Looks like time had diluted it all
And maybe everything that could have been was thrown away
So just take what is left, and somehow fill the space
When I can see through it all, I feel safe again
I feel warmer

Sounds of life outside
Why do I die?
Sounds of life outside
One by one

Ain't got nothing to hide

One by one

Couldn't have seen it come from an inch away
But it's here, right on time
Wait for the flash of grey, and we will feel the same
If we can just drift for a while
When I'm back on the ground, I feel safe again
I feel warmer

Sounds of life outside
Why do I die?
Sounds of life outside

Ain't got nothing to hide

There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing

Is it raining? Is it snowing?
Is a hurricane a-blowing?

Not a speck of light is showing, so the danger must be growing
All the fires of hell are blowing; is the grizzly reaper mowing?
Yes, the danger must be growing, for the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing any signs that they are slowing

There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing

Is it raining? Is it snowing?

Manipulation doesn't shape me; I am just filling the bottle out
And even though this curse restrains me, I can't see anything to yell about

Well, I could fight this, but I may die
And all I want is to be the apple in your eye
Well, I could stay here, strap on my face
Listen to the ones who put me in my place

I am a serial fantasy destroyer
And you wanna know what I'm going to do about it
You thought that my hands were behind my back
Thought I didn't have the nerve to throw it away

'Cause I got the patience
To see that you drown
To watch you go down

Throw it away
'Cause I got the patience
To see that you drown
To watch you go down

I am a reality you wish you were at
At war against your constant manipulation
All this time you thought that I believed you
The more you say, the easier to throw it away

'Cause I got the patience
To see that you drown
To watch you go down

Throw it away
'Cause I got the patience

I was running out in the cold light, wondering where to go
To run away without you
All my fear is coming home, and it's ripped out for the show
You can't be me; I will become you tonight

I was wandering under black skies, clutching at what is mine
No control left to lose
When I felt that it wouldn't phase me, I ran and hid like a child
I feel so guilty; I'll make it up to you tonight

Creatures I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return as our futures

I was breaking out of my old skin, choking upon release
I'm in no state to judge you
Scratching itches best left alone; chasing memories I used to own
I can't wait until this is over tonight

Creatures I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return as our futures

Well, the nightmares I've been having have arrived
They're changing my future
Signs of my creation at my door
How could you do this to her?

You were so held up by your thoughts
Along the way we got divided
And I'm left showing you the door

You couldn't look me in the eyes, so I'll dim the lights
When you take me out on your side
We're spinning out of sight
Believe me, I'm on your side

It took so long for me to speak up
It was the hardest thing to say
Taken right up to the entrance
At the last minute, turned away

Just can't look you in the eyes, so let's dim the lights
Get a case out; pack up your pride
It's over; we're out of time
Don't leave me; I'm on your side

For everything that could have been
Well, at least we took the ride
There's no relief in bitterness
Might as well have let it die

You don't feel my energy, but it won't be long
I see the sun; believe the dark
Soon I disappear, but I'll make my mark

All these fears, and all this love
All you've given me, but it's not enough
All my dreams, and all this stuff
All made real, but it's not enough

Watching, waiting, shaping, faking
Shocking, pumping, mocking, stopping
Falling, stalling, warning, crawling
Rejecting, perfecting, marauding, ending

Behind my eyes is rage alone
But you don't understand; it was all homegrown
I'm not afraid; I just don't belong
It may be cynical, but it all seems wrong

All these fears, and all this love
All you've given me, but it's not enough

The hidden passenger that I've been taking
Close your eyes; let's forget it again
As you drag me down, I will take you in

What are you waiting for? Just surrender here tonight
What are you waiting for? As we go towards the light

When everything is said and done
Still looking for answers, if only one
Turn my back; the urge has gone
Left with no reason, we come undone

I am caught in your slow release
Seems like your traveler's eager to move me
My reflection will slowly fade
To another time, until my head escapes

What are you waiting for? Just surrender here tonight
What are you waiting for? As we go towards the light

When everything is said and done
Still looking for answers, if only one
Turn my back; the urge has gone
Left with no reason, we come undone

Your blood's been poisoned, if your heart is sour
Hear the sound of the war drums

It's the rise of the vulture; gonna keep on climbing
No chance of escape; no use in hiding
Through the eye of the storm, with a silver lining
To the point where it breaks, gonna keep on grinding

We're taking the power

Are being taken from me; I can't get home
Yeah, do your worst, when worlds collide
Let their fear collapse bring no surprise

A snapshot from where you were born
I'm looking for your hand in the rough
You're caught in the wire; well, I'll lift you out

Leading on the action, caught in a cellphone's rays
Bleeding on a sofa, staring at the wayside
He's coming and she knows it, even though she knows why
Footsteps in the hallway; girl, you haven't got time

You gotta get out
Go far away
You gotta get out
Go far away

Darkness in the bedroom; maybe she's resting up
Maybe she was out late, just come back from the club
I can't hear her breathing; something doesn't seem right
Killer in the hallway; we're living on a set time

We gotta get out

They told me that time has only done you wrong

We are going to a different place
We take in everything we can
There's no expression left upon our face

We're sinking in the sand

You've been talking from the heart
Saying that I have been away from earth

This is the final call for the setting sun when they get closer
Now with a fall from grace, I will be done; the show is over
It's a new dawn

Just leave this place behind
I'll clear your bloodshot mind
They only wanted your life on demand
This is a better way

They are standing by; no time to hide; no meeting halfway
You were sucking life through the needle's eye; this is a new day
And they have won

We will surrender now, or be outdone, left in the open
It's the cooling of the horizon; they are the future

I know you really tried to understand

We will drag you from where you are to where you belong

Come on, get up
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Saw you the other day, looking so undermined
Acting like it wouldn't happen; making sense of anything that you could find
Because it's just about to happen, and you'll be there
You must have known the storm was coming when the clouds appeared

May as well let the rain come down
And join the circus of people while you're there

Something is changing, bruising and aching
And I'm trying to find out what it is
When I fix her, she's breaking; reason keeps escaping me
Protecting and burning like a cyst

I know that I can help you; I just don't fucking want to
And the feeling gets stronger by the day
Say that I'm selfish, but I don't really need this
And I'm just so sick of the chase

While you are letting your guard down, I will be letting myself go
While you keep running your ship aground, I will be setting myself alight

Too late; you dropped the drawbridge
You let the vampires in
You caused this shit to happen, and now you want out

Too late; you dropped the drawbridge
You let the vampires in
I hope you know now that it's nobody's fault but yours

While you are letting your guard down, I will be letting myself go
While you keep running your ship aground, I will be setting myself alight

Drowning, but you can't breathe the air to save you
At this point you're right, right, right...

It's in your eyes; a colour fade out
Looks like a new transition
It's starting up and shaking your ground
Turning your head to see a new day calling

Does it feel like a head to lean on?
A snapshot from where you were born
I'm looking for your hand in the rough
You're caught in the wire; well, I'll lift you out

Leading on the action, caught in a cellphone's rays
Bleeding on a sofa, staring at the wayside
He's coming and she knows it, even though she knows why
Footsteps in the hallway; girl, you haven't got time

You gotta get out
Go far away
You gotta get out
Go far away

Darkness in the bedroom; maybe she's resting up
Maybe she was out late, just come back from the club
I can't hear her breathing; something doesn't seem right
Killer in the hallway; we're living on a set time

We gotta get out
Go far away
We gotta get out
Go far away

We gotta get away and disappear
We're running out of time
The sun is low we'll go and break away
Fade into the light

They'll sell your soul just so you'll make believe
You're living in a lie
You never know the way you're killing me
Inside

Now I know the way to go
Show me things I'll never know
Do you want to run away tonight?

He broke my own heart into
He broke my own heart into a million pieces

No you're never gonna let it go
We play these games, so who's to blame?
We never change, just stay the same

Do you really want somebody else?

Say my name
So I fall to the flames
Feel you flow in my veins

We both know now love is not real

from the very first time I saw your face, I knew...
though I never told you so

and when I looked into your eyes I couldn't help but see...
you knew it too

where your heart was sure to go

don't deny
we could find a place where...

we belong

we have wasted
we've been wasting all this time

I have waited
I've been waiting all my life...

for you

so don't let me down
don't let me down again

you know I'd run to you

if only you'd tell me you want me by your side...
I'd be there baby

every night
i feel you running in my dreams
we're running in my dreams

don't deny this
and we'll find a place where...

we belong

do I dare say...

can I dare say...

I love you

and I dare you to say...

oh I dare you to say...

you love me

always
I've loved you

always
I've loved you

(higher, higher)

you better stop playing mind games
cause I know you feel the same

I should be yours
and you should be mine

but don't just say that you love me...
you've gotta show me you love me

all, all night

you know we're running out of time
I know you want another life

well, you know where to find me

but don't just say that you love me...
you've gotta show me you love me...

all, all night

Every night the dream's always the same
Can't escape these walls of dark decay
Feel me drowning underneath the waves
Every time it never seems to change

Took you away and now
They're gonna get it, all I have
You know now you're gone
And I just want to have you back again

Hollow heart is all I have today
Someone came and pulled away the veins
They stitched it up and put me on display
But nothing seems to cure me of the pain

Took you away and now
They're gonna get it, all I have
You know now you're gone
And I just want to have you back again

Took you away

You're laying here with a beds eye view of a body that no longer belongs to you,
 You're scared that the past 3 haven't lived past their 60's and if you break the trend,
 You'll just end up like the old folks at Roland and 3939,
 You're scared because you're an army brat of a man who died before his time.
 I miss those summers, that grill smell, home cooked meals, take me back,
 Sleeping like a log, healing so fast,
 But losing you, I learned to lose my youth, lose my spirit, and now I can't hear it anymore,
 And I guess that's life
 Back then our body parts stayed in place,
 We kept up with our own hearts,
 It was so easy to temper the sting,
 Just be fixed by a quick dip back in some old neighbor's swimming pool
 Now I'm just worn out, and I'll ache like this forever I think,
 These shoddy drapes refuse to keep the cold out
 And this damn body can't keep the warmth in,
 I'm watching my hairline recede, I'm drinking fatigue, I'm fighting heredity
 I see less of who I love the most, time's getting away,
 And we're so slow to say how fast it goes,
 I'm just looking for what's coming, what's built in the blood
 But I've never been that sure of anything anyway
 And I don't want to heal, I'm just about the perfect amount to look how I feel
 And I think about you laying there, waiting for her to get back,
 I think about your last 3 breaths and I wonder if you knew,
 I think about letting you go
 And I guess that's life.

Maybe...; Maybe you saw your mother, maybe she's smiling,
She hears your catching laughter, she's missed your charm,
We never made it to Cooperstown
But I've still got that glove under my bed,
Maybe I'll see you, we could shoot the shit, finally have a beer,
"Have a catch,"but for now its catch my tears, its catch my breath,
I can just hear you say "come on bud, get out of that funk, it's time to move on,"
It's funny how you still apply, you still know me,
I'll try to take your tools and make something worth while,
Try to make ya proud, I've learned nothing is spotless anymore,
But I'll let you resonate...;

Maybe your Heaven is that Norman Rockwell scene
Where you and your friends are singing that Gordon Lightfoot song,
"If you could only read my mind," well if you could only read my mind,
Well that ending, it was just too hard to take,
Is it better than Clapton? Did you see your fathers eyes?
I know it's wishful thinking hoping this won't always kill me,
But If you saw yours, then I'll see mine,
You finally stretched your feet and ghosted away from me,
You had to fade away, you had to leave
I'm pleading for one more time with what I know now,
I'm begging for the same flake to fall twice for the first time,
I'm begging for what wasn't said.
That night the snow shaped the land, and I walked home,
I laughed the whole way because I suppose if it hurts,
It's worth it, but now that ghost is me.

I used to listen to my life,
 I was so put together,
 I chose what I wanted to be in that age of chasing sand,
 The age of believing in everything,
 But I couldn't save you,
 I couldn't save what was taken away,
 And I'm still singing, and you still can't stay.
 You "loved life," and those words have lasted,
 I just wish I would have had ears for more than what you said
 Because I still feel the lack long after.
 Such a light body, such a quiet gait leaving behind the weight of the world,
 I'll always think it was too early to lose your shine,
 I guess the means that ends us means nothing,
 I just hope it's the peace we all need,
 Because I could love and drown in your God damned smile lines,
 But I think I burnt up watching you rallying to stay alive,
 And I guess that's fine.
 It seems we all get sick,
 We all die in some no name hospital with the same colored walls,
 And I guess that's fine,
 But I want to swallow, I want to stomach, I want to live.
 It's been a rough while and some days are worse than others,
 There's no proper way to feel, no mirth, no levity, no amazing grace,
 Just a flame on a lake floating away,
 I can't let you lay,
 I want you to know, I'm learning patience against my will,
 I want you to know, I'll get by, always barely scraping
 With just a hunger, with just a heart apart,
 It's a hell of a thing.

Just sit down, and let it be, if only today, if only for me
That day, what exactly were you selling, preach?
It's misery, these screaming dreams, you see, we all gotta get so broken eventually
And most shouldn't strut around with such confidence
Because most of the time, your feet are the same whether he's there or not
And most of the time, my feet were the same whether you were here or not
And I take it hard, I take it to heart, and it tears me apart
And I get so tired in that 3 o'clock sun
It grows right on time, right in front of me
I've seen some days, and in some ways, I'm always in and out of living in the now
But it sheds years when you still smell the cedar
Explain to me
I wish I could find a god's teeth to grit them for him
I'd cut off his ears, put them to my heart, he'd hear me break
I'd make it obvious to see
Show him a face like water frozen over
A face that's absorbed everything
Show him it was the wrong day
Show him that i've seen my reach
Explain to me
Just sit down, let it be, if only today, if only for me
I've tried to forget what was said after the fact
I'm talking to my own soul
I bottle these potent thoughts
I'm not obtuse anymore
I'm not talking to anyone
I'm not a door anymore
Explain to me
Honestly, I don't know if I'd believe if you walked right on time, right in front of me

There ain't a thing that you can do that's gonna ruin my night
(But there's just something about)
This dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy
Licking your fingers like you're done
And you've decided there is so much more than me (Oh)
And baby, honestly it's harder breathing next to you
I shake, I brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me
Hold my heart, it's beating for you anyway

What if I can't forget you? (Oh)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
And what's so good about pickin' up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole

Nobody prays for the heartless (No)
Nobody gives another penny for the selfish
(You're learning how to) Taste what you kill now
Don't mind me, I'm just reachin' for your necklace
Talkin' to my mom about this little girl from Texas

What if I can't forget you? (Oh)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
And what's so good about pickin' up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole

Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So baby, what if I can't forget you? (What if I can't forget you?)
Collide invisible lips like a shadow on the wall
And just throw, oh no

You can't just throw me away

So what if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
And what's so good about picking up the pieces?
What if I don't even want to?

What if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
And what's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole

Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So baby, what if I can't forget you? (What if I can't forget you?)
I'd better learn to live alone

What's so good about picking up the pieces?

They know when I'm drunk
Always in there it always lets me down

'Cause I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong

I'm in a brawl
'Cause I won't take your lying now
Writing's on the wall
The police are on their way right now

'Cause I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
Yeah I always stay too long
The ladies start singing my
S-song song
S-s-s-s-song-song
S-s-s-s-song-song
S-s-s-song

I got my peeps, them with me shouting "Pull up your socks!"
'Cause we just broke the law and now we're running from cops
I got my lip bust fighting, now there's blood on my top
And I'm still out looking for a party, somewhere to stop
I got my peeps, them tellin me they know where it's at
So I pull out twenty notes and jump straight into a cab
I'm on my way to where I'm going thinking I need more Jack
But that probably ain't the brightest idea I've ever had
'Cause...

I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
(Hey!)

On a run from the law
I'm lookin' worse for wear
I go for a door
Suddenly I find myself somewhere

Something's bound to go wrong
If I stay too long,
I know I've gotta get to dawn,
Before they start singin' my s-s-song,
s-s-song,

S-s-s-s-song-song,

Ah c'mon
ah c'mon
ah c'mon
c'mon,
c'mon,
c'mon!

I've got my peeps them with me at the bar doing shots
'Cause now we're so fucking plastered, we don't know when to stop
I've got my girlfriend ringing me, belling me up
I know I should probably answer but I just can't be fucked
I've got my peeps, them with me and I'm having a blast
I'm feeling so fucking good right now, I want it to last
So I put my phone on silent, and I refill my glass
The music's so fucking banging, feel like I wanna dance
I'm at the bar and I see a chick checking me out,
From afar yeah, she wants my dick, there ain't a doubt,
She's got a skirt so short, make you drool from the mouth,
Lookin' my way as if to say I'm in with a shout,
so I pull a chair over there and buy her a drink,
She says 'Cheers', I say 'Yeah', our glasses go clink,
Now I'm being bad in the car rubbing this girl,
Once the cab is paid we make our way up to the hotel,
Now I'm in the lift, getting lips, oh this is wrong,
But do I care? Do I fuck! I'm on a roll, yo!
Aaaaaaaah!

Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy

A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your make-up runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes

A few minutes with me inside my van
Should be so beautiful if we can
I'm feeling something taking over me

I got wiring loose inside my head

Hear me out before I lose my mind
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind

Give me a smile please
Count the calm and watch my breathing slow
Winding me up tease
Get inside my head and make it show

Oh, yeah, gravity eyelids, gravity eyelids come down
Oh, yeah, gravity eyelids, gravity eyelids come down

Touching your oil skin
Slipping hands down past your waist to find
I've been waiting for hours
Let the salt flow, feel my coil unwind
Go to the edge swim
Brown the eyes that sleep has rendered blind

2nd voice: Come love so young with your gold arms so I wake her
3rd voice: Here's a wish that will glow in the dark

I pull off the road
East of Baldock and Ashford
Feeling for my cell
In the light from the dashboard

Hissing from the road
The smell of rain in the air con
Maybe check the news
Or just put a tape on

Lighting up a smoke
I've got this feeling inside me
Don't feel too good

If I close my eyes
And fell asleep in this layby
Would it all subside
The fever pushing the day by

Motor window wind
I could do with some fresh air
Can't breathe too well

(She waits for me)
I guess I should go now
(Home waits for me)
She's waiting to make up
(She waits for me)
To tell me she's sorry
(Home waits for me)
And how much she missed me
(She waits for me)
I guess I'm just burnt out
(Home waits for me)
I really should slow down
(She waits for me)
I'm perfectly fine but

We'll grow old together

I got religion but I went astray
They took my money and I lost my faith

Close your eyes and let the thought pass

I tried the capsule and I tried the smoke
I tried to aid escape like normal folk
But I never seemed to get the joke

Rain keeps crawling down the glass

These are my old clothes
This is a new low

Is there to please
Strip the soul
Fill the hole
A fire to feed
A belt to bleed
Strip the soul
Kill them all

They are not gone, they are not gone
They are only sleeping
In graves, in ways, in clay
Underneath the floor
Building walls, overalls, getting bored
I got faulty wiring
Brick it up now, brick it up now
But keep the bones

This machine
Is there to please
Strip the soul
Fill the hole
A fire to feed
(Do you want)
A belt to bleed
(A western home)
Strip the soul
(In the)
Kill them all
(Rubble)

(Do you want a western home in the rubble?)

This machine
Is there to please
Strip the soul
Fill the hole

This machine
Is there to please
Strip the soul
Fill the hole

Is there to please
Strip the soul
Fill the hole

Strip the soul
Fill the hole

Strip the soul
Fill the hole

Strip the soul
Fill the hole

He captured and collected things
And he put them in a shed
He raised a proper family
So he could tie them to a bed

The creator had a mastertape
But he left it in a cab
I stared into the void tonight
The best dream I ever had

He worked himself into the ground
And drove a spike into his head
A voice said "Are you happy now?
Your sordid home is running red"

The creator had a mastertape
But he left it in a cab
I stared into the void tonight
The best dream I ever had

Pills and chloroform
All the pages torn
Pills and chloroform
All the pages torn

Hear the sound of music
Drifting in the aisles
Elevator Prozac
Stretching on for miles

The music of the future
Will not entertain
It's only meant to repress
And neutralise your brain

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

Now the sound of music
Comes in silver pills
Engineered to suit you
Building cheaper thrills

The music of rebellion
Makes you wanna rage
But it's made by millionaires
Who are nearly twice your age

Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares
No one cares enough

One of the wonders of the world is going down
It's going down I know
It's one of the blunders of the world that no one cares

Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A 60-ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass
I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides
I'm in luck

When the evening reaches here
You're tying me up
I'm dying of love
It's OK

When I hear the engine pass
I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides
I'm in luck

When the evening reaches here
You're tying me up

I'm so tired, of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long

Just
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over, and give us some room

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look from our side when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

It's all I wanna be is a woman

For this is the beginning of forever and ever

It's time to move over!

It's all I wanna be...

So tired, of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long

Yeah!

Give me a reason to love you

Unable, so lost
I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit

'Cause the child roses like
Try to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy

'Cause the child roses like
Try to reveal what I could feel
But this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no

I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breath this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear

'Cause the child roses like
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness,
Just won't leave me alone

A lady of war

Never found our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel this wrong?

Storm in the morning light
I feel no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
And surely that ain't right

Oh, can't anybody see?
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say

We suffer everyday, what is it for?
These crowns of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary, and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight, it's just a dream
We've crushed everything, I can see, in this morning selfishly
How we've failed, and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn, a stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

And it's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

Ich bin ein Mann vom Mars
Hänge im Raumschiff ab
Blick' aus dem Fenster
Chille nur mit Stars
Ihre milliarden Lichter
funkeln in dem Glas
von meinem Drink, Cheers
Ich trinke auf den Mars

Ich bin der Mann vom Mars
Ich bin der Mann vom Mars
Ich bin der Mann vom Mars
Ich fühle mich so einsam

Ich bin der Mann vom Mars
Ich bin der Mann vom Mars

Warum nervt ihr mich mit diesem ganzen Kleinkram?

Ich bin zu gut angezogen
für einen Sterblichen
Einen nicht von der Erde kommend'n
kann man nicht beerdigen
Man kann ihn nur mit Dreck bewerfen
Doch auch das lässt das Blut kalt in seinem Echsenherzen
Hinter der Ray Ban, stahlblaue Augen
Lass' mein Schnarchen von der NASA belauschen
Die Mädchenköpfe drehen sich, Radioteleskope
Habe ich ihren Radarradius überflogen
Ein silberner Pfeil
Dahinter ein Schweif
Das ist mein Style
Simpel doch geil
Hab' ein' messerschwarzen Blick
Aus mein'n Auge kommen Laser
Trage schwarz und ihr seid
am schnaufen wie Darth Vader
Der C-3PO Goldjunge
Eigenlob stinkt
Doch ich habe nur Lobeshymnen eingeprobt
Prinz Pi, Andromedanebelsektor
Ich komm' aus dem Großen Wagen
Du kommst aus'em Ghetto

Ich bin der Mann vom Mars

Ich bin zu euch nicht kompatibel
Der einzige Adapter ist der Beat
Folgt mir, ihr schafft das, Tschaka!
Ich entzünde meine Kippe an dem Lichtschwert
Yamamoto Raumanzug, Pi ist nur ein Richtwert
Ich kam im Tiefflug angeflogen
Eure Politiker bezahlen wir gut,wer gut schuft.
Sie haben euch angelogen
Sie verbieten euch die Drogen
Die euch sehen lassen würden
Was sie euch nicht sehen lassen dürfen
Ich halte mich für vollkommen
Und euch für vollkommen - egal
Sieh mich eure Raumstation vollbomben
Such' vergeblich auf dem Mond nach der Flagge von Apollo 11
Doch sie ist nicht da
Und sie war nie da

Ich bin der Mann vom Mars

Ich bin der Mann vom Mars

Album  Illuminati
Es fängt jedes mal an mit "Hast du Lust etwas zusammen zu machen?"
Und endet damit seine Sachen zusammen zu packen
Und einander zu hassen und die Liebe von gestern
Für alles Unglück von Heute verantwortlich zu machen
Wir verletzen Menschen, die uns lieben
Lieben Menschen, die uns verletzen
Meine Berufung ist das auszusprechen in Texten
Glaubten an große Gesten, hörten nur tote Wesen
'Nen Fick zu geben ist seeliger als die Kohle nehmen
Und sind wir hier gelandet
Ich wache auf nach Schiffsbruch
Ich bin bei dir gestrandet
Du bist mein kleines Eiland
Nur ich weiß wie die Insel heißt und wo sie liegt
Da auf der Indianerecke, da liegt meine Heimat
Du trägst meine alten Hemden, Löcher im Flanell
Und siehst darin heißer aus als all die Töchter von Chanel

Wo die Liebe hinfällt, stürzen auch wir
Alle Wunder sind uns wirklich passiert
Ich hab dich so geliebt, weil wir das Gleiche hassten
Lass gehen, wo wir noch groß sind
Lass uns nicht kleiner machen

Wo die Liebe hinfällt, stürzen auch wir
Alle Wunder sind uns wirklich passiert
Ich hab dich so geliebt, weil wir das Gleiche hassten
Lass gehen, wo wir noch groß sind
Lass uns nicht kleiner machen

Eines Tages werd' ich sagen
Weißt du noch unsere Zukunft
Die wir uns nach 10 Bechern Whiskey malten
Vom wilden großen Garten, von unseren Kindern sprachen
Völlig selbstständig die gleichen Bilder raten
Von irgendwo kommt leise und heiser Jimi Hendrix
Du sagst Angst vor Bindung, ich sage Independent
Wir verstehen uns blind und das müssen wir
Weil es immer dunkel ist, wenn wir uns sehen, küssen wir

Wo die Liebe hinfällt, stürzen auch wir
Alle Wunder sind uns wirklich passiert
Ich hab dich so geliebt, weil wir das Gleiche hassten
Lass gehen, wo wir noch groß sind
Lass uns nicht kleiner machen

Wir sterben gemächlich, merken es beide doch auch
Feuer ist lange schon aus, Wohnung riecht nach kaltem Rauch
Sagen, wir müssen raus, fahren weg, doch laden nicht auf
Reicht fürs Weitermachen grade so aus
Die Macht der Gewohnheit
Wir wollen nicht enden als Senioren im Wohnheim
Die sich mehr Dulden als lieben
Die Schuld für ein lahmes leben gegenseitig auf sich schieben
Du hältst deine Zigarette wie diesen sprichwörtlichen Strohhalm
Jetzt sitz' ich wieder rum in irgendeinem Backstageraum
Kalt, verraucht irgendwann war er weg der Traum
Alt, verbraucht, beschmiert mit all den schwarzen Eddings
Die Wände leisten mir Gesellschaft, ich höre sie sprechen
Paar hundert Kilometer Autobahn und Regen liegen
Zwischen mir hier und dir und unseren Lebenslügen
Wir klammern uns an unsere ersten Treffen
Zehren von den Bildern hinter denen wir die Wirklichkeit verstecken

Wo die Liebe hinfällt, stürzen auch wir
Alle Wunder sind uns wirklich passiert
Ich hab dich so geliebt, weil wir das Gleiche hassten
Lass gehen, wo wir noch groß sind
Lass uns nicht kleiner machen

Kann es sein, dass du hier nicht reinpasst
Und wenn das stimmt, dann ist das hier vielleicht dein Platz
Dann komm mit, dann komm mit, dann komm mit,
dann komm mit, dann komm mit, dann komm mit,
Das hier wird alles werden, alles nur nicht einfach

Kann es sein, dass der Zauber verflogen ist
Im Fernsehen, im großen Quiz alles gelogen ist
Satan dich nicht mehr direkt nach der Seele fragt
Aber dich bittet, dass du auf sein Logo klickst
dass alles nur Mode ist, die bald wieder out ist
dass Models dünn bleiben durch Rauschgift
dass Wahnisnn Methode ist
kein Eis auf den Polen ist
Heidi mit Bohlen fickt
dass Scheisse halt oben schwimmt
und dass jeder hier Drogen nimmt
dass jeder hier sein' Arsch hinhällt wenn die Kohle stimmt
dass ist eine Wahnsinnswelt voll Idioten ist
dass der Dalai Lama im Lotus sitzt auch auf ein Foto wichst
dass alle Dinge die Spaß bringen verboten sind
dass es keine 40 Jungfrauen nach dem Tode gibt
dass auch der Papst in der Nacht nicht katholisch ist
dass Gollum mit Frodo fickt
dass es kein juckt, ob du solo bist

Doch mach dir keine Sorgen
Noch gibt es Eis im Norden
Wenn es schmilzt, dann surfen wir die Welle
Sei bereit für morgen
Das wird schon gut ausgehen
Noch gibt es Zeit zu borgen
George Bush wird alle retten als der weiße Michael Jordan

Kann es sein, dass du hier nicht reinpasst
Und wenn das stimmt, dann ist das hier vielleicht dein Platz
Dann komm mit, dann komm mit, dann komm mit,
dann komm mit, dann komm mit, dann komm mit,
Das hier wird alles werden, alles nur nicht einfach

Kann es sein, dass Britney mittlerweile einen Arsch hat wie Obelix
und permanent auf Koka ist
dass die besten Partys immer stattfinden ohne dich
dass keiner hört was du sagst, nur wie die Betonung ist
dass das Rosenkreuzerzeichen auf dem Notenbanklogo ist
dass der am meinsten Schwule hasst oft selber Homo ist
dass es alte Stasiwanzen in jeder zweiten Ostberliner Wohung gibt
dass ich endlich sechs Kronen krieg
dass der größte Feind von ihm meist ein Psychologe ist
dass ein Kind dir das Logo ins Polo stickt
dass die CIA Drogen tickt
dass es das iPhone nur mit Provider, nicht ohne gibt
dass Steve Jobs und Bill Gates nun offziell Klone sind
und Apple jetzt Teil der verbotenen Zone ist
dass die Lyrik der Neuzeit eine 16-zeilige Strophe ist
dass Peyote eine heilige Droge ist

Doch mach dir keine Sorgen
Noch gibt es Eis im Norden
Wenn es schmilzt, dann surfen wir die Welle
Sei bereit für morgen
Das wird schon gut ausgehen
Noch gibt es Zeit zu borgen
George Bush wird alle retten als der weiße Michael Jordan

Kann es sein, dass du hier nicht reinpasst
Und wenn das stimmt, dann ist das hier vielleicht dein Platz
Dann komm mit, dann komm mit, dann komm mit,

Album  Neopunk
Das ist lass den Korn rumgehen
Handy nehmen,Pornos drehen, Gangbang Szenen
Aus Langeweile bis an die Grenzen gehen
Rumhängen dumm quatschen aufmucken rumatzen
Durchdrehen aus Frust auf die Welt jemanden umklatschen
Sieh dir die Jugend an wie die Medien sie verteufeln
Blick in die Städte wo aus Fenstern die Fernseher leuchten
Blick auf all die Deutschen in den kleinen warmen Häuschen
Die mit den satten Bäuchen die sich ständig selber täuschen
Im reichsten Land der Welt wo kein Arsch zufrieden ist mit dem was er hat weil ein jeder hier zu gierig ist
In dem gleichen Land wo die Moral so verdreht ist, ihre Werte heissen Porsche,BMW und Mercedes




Sie nehmen dir deine Jugend, du hast keine Jugend
Halbstarke,Alkfahne so leicht einzustufen
Sie nehmen dir deine Jugend , du hast keine Jugend
Halfzware alles drin in einem song von 3 Minuten


Das ist Flatrate Saufen , in den Backstage laufen
Pfund Skunk kaufen gleich das ganze Pack weg rauchen
Das ist Euphorie im Lichtertunnel , das ist Farben sehn
Fenster auf Mucke laut, Runden im geklauten Wagen drehn
Stummel aus dem Fenster schnippen,trauern wenn die beste Freundin ernst macht und schließlich damit anfängt sich längst zu ritzen
das ist mit ihren Eltern in der Notaufnahme sitzen,
wo die beiden Kokanasen nur von sich und über Porschefahren über ihren nächsten Schuss Botox sprachen,während die eigene Tochter nebenan im Koma lag
Das ist Myspace, Top Friends und ICQ
das ist kein bock haben auf irgendein scheiss beruf
Auf den Schultern keine Engel sitzen, neongelber Pali schal
Schwachsinn reden,Absinth heben ,Kreuzberg Zyankhali Bar
Die Mädels schminken ihre Augen dunkel ,fallen auf doch im Club da sind alle drauf, rauf und sie tauchen unter




Sie nehmen dir deine Jugend, du hast keine Jugend
Halbstarke,Alkfahne so leicht einzustufen
Sie nehmen dir deine Jugend , du hast keine Jugend
Halfzware alles drin in einem song von 3 Minuten


Das ist zu seim' Kumpel kommen ,die Wohnungstür ist unverschlossen, mitten in seim Wohnzimmer hat er sich in sein Mund geschossen , Tapete voll ,Sein letzter Gruß rot auf weiß , deine Lippen wiederholen das Echo seines Todesschrei
Das ist wenn die Eltern meinen,mit ein bisschen Geldverteilen ham sie dann genug getan du stolperst in die Welt hinein und deine Chucks rutschen aus, in dem Schlamm und Matsch in der Welt die die Generation vor dir verschandelt hat
Das ist mit ganzer Kraft dagegen zu halten, das ist mit liquids deinen Schädel zu spalten, das ist versuchen mal ein mädel zu halten, das ist Rebell sein aus prinzip. Das ist Neopunk,das ist nix blicken rennen in die Nebelwand
Das ist mit dem Messer spielen,aufwachen beim Ticker und beim gehn die letzen Reste ziehen, Schlägereien auf Tilidin
Das ist auf den Boxsack hauen,das ist ihm die Hoffnung klauen das ist alles fühlt sich nur noch an wie ein bekloppter Traum




Sie nehmen dir deine Jugend, du hast keine Jugend
Halbstarke,Alkfahne so leicht einzustufen
Sie nehmen dir deine Jugend , du hast keine Jugend

bleibt auf dem boden punks, macht einen rosenkranz
denn ich tanze auf dem splash euren totentanz
und ich tanz, tanz, tanz, tanz auf vollspeed
ich hab die golfschläger hier, das ist der neue golfkrieg


ich kann mir kein siebener leisten, noch ein siebener eisen
und was ich damit treibe, bringt mich auf die titelseiten
ich spiele crossgolf auf dem splash
schieße auf die mainstage, der boss wollte sekt
das war mein butler eves und das ist nathalie
ich lass mich nass rasiern und lass dich massakriern
aus den tiefen berlins, aus der wiege des nils
homie, pi diktiert jetzt wie Idi Amin
ja, ich nehm mein einer holz, das ist der driver
scheiss mir einen teich von gold, reich mir meine leica
ich will das fotografieren, wie diese homos posieren
wie ein haufen von exotischen tieren
ich finde euch noch viel, viel schlechter als letztes jahr
denn eure texte sind beschissener als zecken im arsch

sie komm in schwarzen leihwagen und mit scharen bodyguards
ich mit schwarzer brille, plastiknase und nem falschen bart
und unter meinem mantel, trag ich die fitnesshantel
schmeiß mit zwei kilo scheiben, wenn die bitches tanzen
das was sie so vermeiden, nämlich anders sein
das leb ich vor, tanz den totentanz ganz alleine
ich brauch kein vip zelt, ich brauch ein pi zelt
euer kackgame, ich bezahls mit spielgeld
euer rapfame, was für eine spiegelwelt
wo sonst gilt man nicht als schwul in einem lila pelz
ein großes abenteuer, ihr sitzt am lagerfeuer
und ich liefer einen guten grund für eure paranoia
und die bomben sind schon lange versteckt
wo weiss nur ich, die uhr tickt, in meiner hand ist der sekt
und schon bald, schon sehr bald, gibt es einen riesigen knall
und all die abgehobenen spasten fliegen endlich ins all


bleibt auf dem boden punks, macht einen rosenkranz
denn ich tanze auf dem splash euren totentanz

Pulled from the quiver
By trace fingers
Slipping through the minder's
Red suede gloves

A meal can be made
The body is prepared
A meal can be made
The body is prepared

Red arrow sent to hurt
Where will she choose to strike?
Moss rolls around
Wet rock like claws
Arrow strikes fat
Diving through the center of you

Bound by the summer lock
A meal can be made
Bound by the summer lock
A meal can be made

In the distance
The bell is repeating the dull morning trance
Ants scatter in shade
Hornets dart

Which monster will hear her call?
Whose slave will eat tonight?

I heard that Elizabeth Short
Came back to Los Angeles.
She wasn’t wearing black anymore,
But she still had a secret, she said.

She told me,
"Now, smoke reverses back into the cigarette".

Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
The rungs of me be under, under you

I'll take the South pockets gladly
Over the rocky cliffs that you leap
To peer over and not forget what feet are
Splitting threads of thunder over me

But I might see with my chest and sink
Into the edges round you
Into the lakes and quarries that brink
On all the edges round you, round you, round you

Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
Through arms that may be crowns over you

Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
Though arms that may be under, under you

I'll take the South pockets likely
Over the rocky cliffs that you leap
To peer over and not forget what feet are
Splitting threads of thunder over me

Listen closely, closely to the floor
Emitting all its graces through the pores
You make a fine shrine in me
You'll build a fine shrine in me

But I must see with my chest and sink
Into the edges round you
Into the lakes and quarries that brink
On all the edges round you, round you, round you

Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
Through arms that may be crowns over you

Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
Through arms that may be under, under you

You wanna know if I know why?
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye
Or how one becomes two
I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin the end
I ain't here to break it
Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu

Sometimes the same is different
But mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life
That just ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun
And the moon I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wan' do
Anytime, anywhere

I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it (anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu (yeah)
I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu

I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu

How we feelin' out there?
How's your drive time commute?
I need a saga. What's the saga?
It's "Songs for the Deaf"
You can't even hear it

Dead bull with the life from the low
I’ll be massive conquistador
Give me soul and show me the door
Metal heavy, soft at the core
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Pressurize, neutralize
Deep fried, gimme some more

Fortified with the liqour store
This one's down, gimme some more

I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an distrustful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, 'cause I believe in you
Oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
spread wings and fly away
I believe i can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly...(i can fly,i can fly)
woo... i can fly
hmmmmm...fly, fly, fly

Come wit it now
Come wit it now

The microphone explodes, shattering the molds
Either drop the hits like De-La-O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-opt

Terror rains, drenchin', quenchin' the thirst of the power dons
That five-sided Fist-a-gon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger's cold, empty ya purse

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not clothes, not shoes, not need
Just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now

What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now

We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades

Since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
Planet earth kept going through changes
And then the renaissance came
And times continued to change
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Doctor Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades

We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk

From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singing electronic chants like
Zulu nation
Revelation
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

Now renegades are people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades, we're the people with our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me c'mon!

We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk

We're poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', an' sockin', an' rockin', an puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because we're, poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop

We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
'Cause everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh

C'mon

There was a time when our music
Was something called the big street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor

Say jam sucka (jam sucka)
Say jam sucka (jam sucka)
Say groove, sucka (groove sucka)
Now groove, sucka (groove sucka)
Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)
Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)
Say move, sucka (move sucka)
Now move, sucka (move sucka)

Say jam sucka (jam sucka)

Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)

Transmission, Third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
Ain't no shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade

As the polls close like a casket
Our truth devours a silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised

Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
It's a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes

The Fistagon's bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord?
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up

Contact, I hijack the frequencies
Blockin' the Beltway, move on D. C.
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off, Mumia Guan, be free

Who got 'em, yo, check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
All of you pigs trying to silence my style
Off 'em all out that box, it's my radio dial

Yeah

The world is my expense
It's the cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed

Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

Hey, hey, sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, sleep now in the fire

The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa María
The noose and the rapist, the fields overseer
The Agents of Orange, the Priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire, sleep now in the fire

Hey, hey, sleep now in the fire

For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that made you ill

The glamor subdued me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty, please fill me

Mister anchor assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing

I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you

Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless ones
Who travel now in coffins

On the corner (corner, corner, corner)
The jury's sleepless (sleepless, sleepless, sleepless)
We found your weakness (weakness, weakness, weakness)
And it's right outside your door

With precision, you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me
So I can carry on

My slaving, sweating
The skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking
On the smoke that fills my home

The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness, your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

While on the corner (corner, corner, corner)

Deutschland sollte eine Festung gegen Faschismus sein
Da vor über 60 Jahren, was
Viele nicht begriffen haben
Hierher der Holocaust kam
Beinahe gewann

Heiliges römisches reich deutscher Nation
Stolz ist die leere im herzen der dummen
Hurrapatrioten – flaggen drohen von Balkonen

Wir sind wieder wer
Zwischen Alpen und Meer
Wer sein land liebt ist ein Idiot
Der völlig sinnentleert
Nichts erschaffen hat,  das sich zu leben lohnt

Warum denkt der Rassist das ausgerechnet seine Rasse die beste ist
Wieso glaubt der Naziskin, sie würden ihn und seinesgleichen nicht sofort deportieren

Wo die fahnen wehen ist der verstand in der trompete
Schwarz Rot Gold
Dummheit und stolz wachsen auf demselben holz

Es gibt nichts gutes außer man tut es
Wir sind alle Ausländer, fast überall
Steh auf bleib nicht sitzen

Die Augen auf im Morgengrauen, so weckt dich der Alarm
Abmaschiert wie programmiert, so geht das schon seit Jahren
So überleb und halt dein Maul und mach den Herren platz
Beiß nicht die Hand, die dich ernährt, sonst wirst du nicht mehr satt

Du glaubst, was sie dir geben und stehst dafür bereit
Totale Überwachung hier damit es auch so bleibt
Ein jeder giert nach Luxus und du hast keine Wahl
So dreht sich das Getriebe, so läuft der Räuberstaat

Hey, Maschinen-Mensch du merkst doch längst nichts mehr

Hey Achtung, nächster Überfall, komm halt jetzt mal schön still
Da im Grunde jeder hier nur dein Bestes will
So abkassiert die Gegenwart, der Vorgang ganz normal
Die Zukunft wird für dich verkauft so bist du Teil des Plans

Sie rauben dir dein Leben und stehlen dir deine Zeit
Beim Lügen keine Fehler und jeder weiß Bescheid
Programme laufen weiter, sie werden nicht lahm
Die Einen bleiben gleicher, die Andern eben arm

Hey, Maschinen-Mensch du merkst doch längst nichts mehr

Hoch die Norm die Angst sitzt tief
Irgendwann hat's einer satt
Stellt sich quer und macht alles platt

For a king
To rule my mind
Or anything

I don't need your
Band of gold
To take me where I need to go

Well he could do more
But you can only see the traces
That have gone before

There's an edge to life
That will cut you like a knife
When you lay your head down
There's a castle of sand
That gets kicked in your face
To see how easily you'd fall from grace
There's a piece of dust
That crumbles in your hand
If you decide to lose control
No one can escape
When you find out they're fake
And you want to take the whole lot down

A simple man
Well he could do more
But you can only see the traces
That have gone before

There's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
If you walk the white line
There's a piece of dust that crumbles in your hand
If you decide to lose control
There's a castle of sand that gets kicked in your face
To see how easily you'd fall from grace
Yes, there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow

There's an edge to life
That will cut you like a knife
When you lay your head down
You know you can't escape
When you find out they're fake
And you want to take the whole lot down
There's no truth in the lie that only angels cry
When everybody knows we're all born to die
There's an edge to life
That will cut you like a knife

I miss you
There's no power that is such a thrill
That can make a man or anything

I miss you

I miss you

I miss you

I miss you

I miss you

Kid, don't lose your cool
It's still too soon to have to choose a brighter doom
It's hard to believe
But I can see how there could be so little left to lose
(Cracking open skulls like cans of beans
On Christmas Eve)

Mama's not okay
She lights a candle for ev'ry day that you're away
Today could be the one she burns the motherfucker down
Her final act of grace
In a pointless, endless race

Kid, you're under fire
Your life is coming down to the wire
Maybe you'll take the Captain's hand
Carry his ship through burning sands
Cradle your rifle like a man

Mama says "No way," she's lost it all
You've got to stay to make her pay
She knows the fiend upon the throne's
A goddamn sucker for the stone
Until the day he dies alone

Stainless steel providers,
Make it obvious-
We like driving the point home,
A hundred thousand vagabond insects
All making a meal out of stainless steel
You should kick away the watchword
And throw caution to the wind
Remember what it's like
When we are
Screaming, dreaming, screaming, dreaming, screaming, dreaming
Screaming, dreaming, screaming, dreaming...
Stainless steel!

Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers

Get around, get around, I get around
When it's time to go, I'm the first to know
A parasitic nation!
Is it good enough for me?
I'll make you a mantra
From monkeys and car bombs
Beneath, beneath, beneath, beneath, beneath, beneath

Quick locate and detonate your public enemy
Stainless steel, believe it's real,
It's all you mean to me
What's that sound, what's that sound
It bleeds efficiency
The way I feel on stainless steel,
And all it does to me

Stainless steel providers

Another tire
Let it catch on fire
A metal motor mantra
Makes you waste the time of day
You'll sit on a time bomb, forever and ever
Now breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe!

Quick locate and detonate your public enemy
Stainless steel, believe it's real,
It's all you mean to me
What's that sound, what's that sound
It bleeds efficiency
The way I feel on stainless steel,
And all it means to me

I never should have made it but I'm still alive
With a passion for destruction and a love for fire
I remain when it falls apart
Like the burning episodes of blackened heart

Hey!
Heh!

Just a remider that no one cares
Starin' into space like nobody's there
Bulletproof and ten feet tall
I ain't gonna sleep until I've seen it all

Look into my eyes, you'll see dead end streets
A lot of sad faces and a lot of bad days

Dead end streets
Dead end!
Dead end streets
Dead end!
Dead end streets
Dead end!
Dead end streets

Out of control and misunderstood
I never been kin to anything good
Broke every promise that I ever made
Took everything I ever gave

Look into my eyes, you'll see dead end streets
A lot of sad faces and a lot of bad days

Dead end streets
Dead end!
Dead end streets
Dead end!
Dead end streets
Dead end!

Dead end streets

The kinda trouble you wish you'd never met
A terrible secret you would love to forget
The feeling like you're coming down from tripping too long
The choice to make when it all goes wrong

Look into my eyes, you'll see dead end streets
A lot of sad faces and a lot of bad days

Dead end streets

Bein' a man or bein' a woman
Has nothing to do with your genitallia.
It has to do with what's right in your heart.

(Man? Or woman? Or both?)

She's got a reason to lie
She's got a reason to cry
How she was born as guy
Kiss your good mother goodbye

Shake it now, shake it now, shake it now

Why do I dance?
That's a good question.
I'm dancing to pay for my operation.

(Man? Or woman? Or both?)

She's got a surprise
She's a he in disguise
Concealing all is wise
Tucking it up to down size

Shake it now, shake it now, shake it now

Loving it baby, I'm loving myself
Loving it baby, I'm loving myself
Loving it baby, I'm loving myself
Loving it baby, yes I'm loving myself

On the good days I feel like I get it, like it all makes sense.
I can stay in the moment, I don't have to control everything in the future.
On the bad days I just wanna grab the phone and start dialing numbers.

Prune tang's here
Oh, yeah!
She's all damn rich
Knows where to scratch me when I itch
She's a wrinkled little bitch
She sucks the chrome right off my trailer hitch

Prune tang!

When she goes awry
You find out quick there's no other way
She's a one stop shop
She's always open and ready to rock

My-my-my-my prune tang!

My-my-my-my prune tang!

Miles and miles of duct tape
Couldn't match up my day
Nothing in this world but sweet prune tang
Could ever make me feel this way

Hey, didn't I see you at the Sizzler last night?
I never heard of them. Do you have change for a dollar?
No, but I bet that dress is real expensive.
It's too cold, and I can't stand salty stuff.
Let me get that for ya baby.
You should speak to my roommate, she owns two of them.
Ever seen one of these before?
You're shorter than me!
You're shorter than me.

Mr. Lucky just hit the street, and he's lookin for something cheap.
He's gonna steal himself a cop car, cheap ass blow, and a bite to eat.
"I'm gonna score me a b.p. vest, pimp my intellect and burn the rest,
Cut a few scars in the life story bar, get a big load off my chest..."

"Don't you know I got two things on my mind.
First one's nothing, second's woman kind!
Introduce me to the fox with goldie locks, and mama bear's behind.
A black cat's crossed your path.
Valentino and psychopath
Claw me in the light of the stars tonight,
Drown me in your bath..."

With her back against the record machine,
She's a 4am beauty queen
If I throw a six she's mine tonight
Undressed and seventeen
Wait a minute!
Who's that lucky guy? He's got the devil in his eye
Rings on his fingers and an empty glass and a queen with a big surprise

Mr. Lucky just hit the deck, with the liquor in full effect,
Lend me an ear and a shot and a beer and I'll pay with a third-party check,
Hey, what's the matter with you, man?
You gonna burn me catch as catch can
Throw him a bone and he'll leave you alone
Don't blink, he's a lucky man

I can still remember
The words and what they meant
As we etched them with our fingers
In years of wet cement

The days blurred into each other
Though everything seemed clear
We cruised along at half speed
But then we shifted gears

We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
But even then, we should have stayed

But we ran away
Now all my friends are gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

Identities assume us
As nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches
With the seconds that we lost
And I looked up and saw you
I know that you saw me
We froze but for a moment
In empathy

I brought down the sky for you, but all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name

And you ran away
Now all my friends are gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

We're all OK, until the day we're not
The surface shines, while the inside rots
We raced the sunset and we almost won
We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on

And we ran away
Now all my friends gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

When our rivers run dry and our crops cease to grow
And when our summers grow longer and winters won't snow
From the banks of the ocean and the ice in the hills
To the fight in the desert where progress stands still
When we've lost our will

That's how we'll know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We're crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace

When the air that we breathe becomes air that we choke
When the marsh fever spreads from the swamps to our homes
When your home on the range has been torn down and paved and
The buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave
What more will it take

For us to know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
Kissing the ground as we all fall from grace

This is a chance to set things straight
To bend or break the rules back into place
There is no middle ground, no compromise, we've drawn the line
With perfect aim, we stand back and throw
Glass windows break and its all about to blow
Lights go out as we pass the torch again
In hope that it stays lit

Neutrality means that you don't really care
Cause the struggle goes on even when you're not there
Blind and unaware...

That's how we'll know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We're crashing into the ground as we all, yeah we all, all fall from grace

All we are is entertainment
Caught up in our own derangement
Tell us what to say and what to do
All we are are pretty faces
Picture perfect bottled rage
Packaged synthesized versions of you

We've all made petty fortunes, but we can't afford a life (whoa)
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms (hey, hey, hey, hey)
They all scream California and its toppling empire
But can't you see the end is coming soon

Hey!

Come one, come all, the new sensation
Guarantees then obligations
Spotlights follow every single move (move, move, move)
Basking here on ten foot stages
Pouty lips and oh so jaded
All as if we have something to prove

Despite these petty fortunes we still can't afford a life (whoa)
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms (hey, hey, hey, hey)
They all scream California and its toppling empire
But can't you see the end is here

And if we cared at all
About this unknown plight
Then we'd do something more
To finally make this right

Is this only entertainment
Pull the curtains, places please
We've learned to sing and dance and cry on cue
But this is more than entertainment
In a world so sick with pain
This is the only thing that's real or true

We've all made petty fortunes, but we can't afford a life (whoa)
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms (hey, hey, hey, hey)
They all scream bloody murder over graves already dug
But can't you see the end...

We are the children you reject and disregard
These aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts
You can't disown us now, we are your own flesh and blood
And we don't disappear just because your eyes are shut, now tell me

Love, loss, like a bullet's path
Tear through the cavity of my chest
Lights out because the fuse has blown

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy (watch them fall)
As we gain control

This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day it began
Because it's the race we run, but it keeps us at the start
And it's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart, that's how we

Read you like a polygraph
Not one single bone in your back
Own up to how you let us down

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy (watch them fall)
As we gain control

Except for you and me, love
Everyone is the same, we know
We know, we know, we know

But if to live, we have to be numb
I'd rather know the pain
I'd rather know, I'd rather know

This happens almost never
But it happened once to me
And this will never be same

The ends we seam together

I'm not after fame and fortune
I'm after you
When I've served my time
I swear I will come back for you

(Watch them fall...)

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy
Right on to ours, but I'm after you
But I'm after you
I'm after you
And I'm after you

A sinking ship, an awkward kiss
A chance to set things straight
The kind of hurt that burns and burns
Like fires we can't contain

We hole up in a shelter made of bones and ice and there we'll wait
So start again with steady hands
This time nothing gets in our way
But as we peer a little closer what do we see?

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against)

A promise kept
The dirt unswept
A poorly worn disguise
A child unloved that then grows up
To love what we despise

We're broken but still breathing
We are wounded but we are healing
We pick up right where we left off
Breathe on the ashes that remain

So that these coals may become fire
To guide our way

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against)

I walk on wounds
That seldom prove to slow me down
I laugh this constant pain away
So you can't tell
But there it lies under the smiles
It drains me mile after mile
But seldom proves to slow me down

Here I go...
Here I go...
Here I go...

Should we just hold on
To what remains of
What we thought was lost

But it's just a crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against)

A crack in the surface...

He said "Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid."
I said "That sounds pretty good."

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends

They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away

And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

He said, "Son, have you seen the world?
Well what would you say, if I said that you could?"

Can there be a place to call our own?

We toe the line (toe the line)
We go along (we go along)

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms, the skies as grey as leaves
The rivers flood the banks and spill into the streets
But the people laughed and swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave way as if to agree
When it rains it pours

The mystery unknown now unfolds
The life that we once owned, first bought, then sold
Like messengers of war, we've no control
To oceans unexplored
This ship sails through

We toe the line (toe the line)

When they die we mourn
When it hit, we swore
Now we want not more
Like a saint re-born
Like a rose in a storm

It's the coin we're tossing into the well
It's misfortune that we could not foretell
It's the dry spell

The rivers flood the banks and spill into the streets
But the people laughed and swore that they'd restore

And then the clouds gave way as if to agree
When it rains it pours

They're high on the watchtower,
Keeping the peace...;
Whatever that means.
Because you see the world grow,
Crosshairs and TVs, don't you?

Ten foot walls built around us,
White picket death.
So quiet, so safe.
But if we fall there will be nothing, and no one to catch us.
Sit back and watch as we...;

Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Try to recover, but collide with each other.
We spin out of control,

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)

Something I can't change,
I was born in a place,
That lives by the sword.
And thus to it's blade we're condemned.
Don't you understand why we scream "no more."? (no more!)

My dreams are of children,
Orphaned by blood,
Spilt at these hands.
Here on the graves of the innocent,
We raise our flag.

Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Try to recover, but collide with each other.
We spin out of control.

(Hey!)

Some things you don't forgive, some things you don't forget.
Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death.
We're way off course now and we're drifting out to sea.
So cut the anchor on your heart to be set free,
Set free,
Set free!
Yeah.

Spin out of control,

Try to recover, we have to recover,
Before we crash, one after the other.
Spin out of control.

Far from home on a road unknown
Where the vultures circle on winds that blow
From northern skies that haunt these waking moments
On shadows cast by the mountain range
On calloused soles we find our way
Through desperate eyes, we long for the horizon
While this sun is rising

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
We are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you've undone

When cries for help go unanswered
And signal fires just burn and burn
We wonder if we're waiting here for nothing
'Cause our lips are sewn our ears are filled
With the constant drone of the unfulfilled
But we'll never fall if we stand for something
We stand for something

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
We are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you've undone

Don't fall, I see lights in the distance
They're not far away
Stand up because the sky is turning gray

There's hope in these footsteps of persistence
So don't go astray
These lights get closer everyday

We are the long forgotten sons
Yeah, we are the long forgotten sons

To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away

To the rhythm of the awful rusting machines
We toss and turn but don't sleep
Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
'Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
And the blare of the sirens combing the street
Chased down like dogs we run from
Your grasp until the sun comes up

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
'Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
Look now at what they've done to you

White needles buried in the red
The engine roars and then it gives
But never dies
'Cause we don't live
We just survive
On the scraps that you throw away

I won't crawl on my knees for you
I won't believe the lies that hide the truth
I won't sweat one more drop for you
'Cause we are the rust upon your gears
We are the insect in your ears
We crawl...
We crawl...
We crawl all over you!

We sow seeds to see us through
Our days are precious and so few
We all reap what we are due
Under this sky no longer blue
We bring a dawn long overdue
We crawl...
An' we crawl...
An' we crawl all over you!

It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is dropping
Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out?
'Cause I don't know

That's when she said I don't hate you boy
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
That's when I told her I love you girl
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh

And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out?
'Cause I don't know

That's when she said I don't hate you boy
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
That's when I told her I love you girl
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again

I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no

So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out?
'Cause I don't know

That's when she said I don't hate you boy
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
That's when I told her I love you girl
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh

I don't hate you
I don't hate you, oh, oh
I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no, oh, oh

She got down on hands and knees
One ear against the ground
Holding her breath to hear something
But the dirt made not a sound, tonight

Echoes of songs still lurk on distant foreign shores
Where we danced just to please the gods that only ask for more
And so it goes

But still we give ourselves to this
We can't spend our lives waiting to live

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
The daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip

The postcard says wish you were here
But I'd rather I was there
Holding on to the simple things before they disappear
That's what I meant

But that was then, and this is now
I'll make it up to you somehow

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
The daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip

A destination, a fading smile
Another station, another mile
Another day gone, I swore that I will
Be there before dawn
So be there, I will...

She got down on hands and knees
One ear against the ground
Holding her breath to hear something
Anything at all

The dirt whispered, "Child, I'm coming home"

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
The daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip, I slip...
Through the cracks I slip... (Through the cracks I slip...)
Through the cracks I slip...

Welcome home
While away
They have tampered with the locks
And your things they rearranged

We propose,  a better way
Said the note they left behind
In their wake of disarray
You fell in place

Don't fall asleep
They'll find us here
I know a place, to disappear
As a voice proclaimed

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on

Let us cry
Let us be
Let us open up our hearts
Without fear of anything

Faith alone
Is all we need
To traverse this burning bridge
Now before it gets too late
You claim "it's fine"

But the heart reveals
What smiles betray
Your sad sad eyes gave you away
And don't you know

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on

Our shoulders bear an awful weight
But still we trudge on just the same
Our colors run then leave a stain

They blacken our once honest name
How can we argue, tell me
Over the fury and the fire
How many times can we tell you that we
Are not like you, we see right through
Your poor disguise that fails to fool
The wary eye that is trained on you

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on

To the ends of this lost world
You have marched and you have sworn
To a tainted crown of thorns

As the hungry sails unfurl
We are thrusted from the shore
And it's you that we search for

The blackest night
The midnight sun
The covered tracks
And days spent on the run
The strangers we've become

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright...

Another place, another time
We toed the same side of the line
Yeah, we saw eye to eye

Even then the saddest sounds
Were nothing laughter could not drown
But we are not laughing now

I see your face
In my sights
I hesitate
And then look for a sign
Somewhere in the sky

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright...

Even together, we stand apart
Swallow the sun, erase the sky
An invitation that's been declined
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Your whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright now

It's alright yeah
'Cause all is forgiven
If you could just listen....
It's alright

'Cause I've been there before
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening

These calloused fingers are wrapped
Around a black ball-point pen
These eyes don't wander as far
As they at one time did
I've seen the future, it's fading faster

No place that I'd rather be

There's no time that I'd rather be

I'm on the other end begging you
Pick up the phone
A shaking whisper is answering
Don't call anymore
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening

Freeze me in this moment
Thaw me in ten years
When the fires burned out and the smoke clears

No place that I'd rather be

Simply because you can breathe
Doesn't mean you're alive
Or that you really live
This life has taken its toll
And she just doesn't know
How much more she can give

But here, at the top of the world
Where I raise my hands and I clench my fists
They stand before me below
Demanding the answers with flips of a switch

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply engrained in your head
(That this world) Is something that you must impress
Because I couldn't care less

A need for revolution's rising
It comes to the surface, gasping for air
We're not putting up with this planet
One more day, much less one more year

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply engrained in your head
(That this world) Is something that you must impress
Because I couldn't care less

So here and now, in our rotting nation
The blood, it pours, it's all on our hands now
We live in fear of our own potential
To win, to lose, it's all on our hands now

I have an American Dream
But it involves black masks and gasoline
One day I'll turn these thoughts into screams
At a world that turned its back down on me

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply engrained in your head
(That this world) Is something that you must impress
'Cause I couldn't care less

Our building have fallen, our walls all caved in
And we can't comprehend this sad state that we're in
So we sift through the ashes of what we've become
And surrender here one by one
So push us down

And we get right back up again
The things you're telling me aren't making any sense
Right back up again
I'm sick of wishing for someone else to come

Let the blind lead the blind
'Cause it's eye for an eye in your so called life
Are you out there? Are you listening?
Is there something we're still missing?

Let the blind lead the blind
'Cause it's eye for an eye
We all fall down

And we get right back up again
The things you're telling me aren't making any sense
Right back up again
I'm sick of wishing for someone else to come

We're spinning out of control
We're trying to find somewhere to land
And I don't want you to know
The things that keep me down

'Cause we get right back up again
The things you're telling me aren't making any sense
Right back up again
I'm sick of wishing for someone else to come

I never claimed to be something more than me
Your standards I refuse to see
I will answer only to myself
So why don't you police someone else

The place I call home isn't there anymore
With boards on the windows and locks on the door
So pick up the pieces that never once fit
Let this be the end of it

Once you held a place for me
But now that I've left you went and gave up my seat
Don't expect me to share your visions of life
I'll take the chances somewhere else

The place I call home isn't there anymore
With boards on the windows and locks on the door
So pick up the pieces that never once fit
Let this be the end of it

Give me the green light to get on with my life
Pick up the pieces then roll the fucking dice
Give me the green light to get on with my life
Pick up the pieces then roll the fucking dice

I live in exile of you, your key no longer fits
Because the locks on my life are new

Now is this the point where we turn ourselves in?

Or is this the time to ask questions?
Or is this the time to seek answers?
Now is this the time to throw it all in?

When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
You're halfway there
That's when you know that you're halfway there

This is the point where we stand up
Now this is the point where we take back
The things that are keeping us from being free

So when enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there

Woah, woah
Your voice the airwaves sent you prayed my life would end
Woah, woah

The day I learn to fly
I'm never coming down
On perfect wings I'll rise
Through the layers of the clouds

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
Where six million people that keep their fires lit

And I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place from you

I see myself inside you
You dream the dreams that I do
You're still searching for these answers
They're not inside your wrist

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
Where six million people that can keep their fires lit

And I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place from you

And I close my eyes as the curtains draw
I thought I heard your voice but I thought wrong
'Cause you're not there anymore
No, you're not there anymore

And so I lift my chin as the show goes on
The sky is listening, the stars all sing along
But you're not there anymore
And I just can't care anymore

Late nights and bloodshot eyes
Clock ticking half past five
We're barely breathing but we're still alive
Go!

Our plans are all laid out
Take all these unmarked roads
We blaze the trails to places no one goes
Yeah!

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
Let's go!
One last chance to go
Let's take it now, in for the kill

In time we find ourselves
Back where we started from
Too weak to fight and much too tired to run
Yeah!

Before you swallow me
Into your perfect life
I'm not going out without a fight

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
Let's go!
One last chance to go
Let's take it now, in for the kill

(If I had to leave tonight would you come with me?)
(What?)
(If I had to go to New York, and live, tonight, would you come with me?)

But this blueprint's faded grey
And here it seems like just yesterday
When we mapped out the details of our great escape

But still these roads all beckon me
To uncover their mystery
But I fall like dead autumn leaves
And let the jetstream carry me

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
Let's go!
One last chance to go

They turn the lights down low
In shadows hiding from the world
Only coming out when it gets cold

The seas part when they hit the floor
The voices carry on and out the door
And everything you touch turns into gold

Like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Your answer's always 'maybe'
That's when I got up and left

A beating heart, a microphone
A ticking clock in an empty home
Still tells of these times so long ago

And even though I've come so far
I know I've got so far to go
And any day now I'll explode

Like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Your answer's always 'maybe'
That's when I got up and left

And each and everyday, we'll lead into tomorrow
Tomorrow brings one less day without you
But don't wait up, just leave the light on
'Cause all the roads that I might take
Will all one day lead back to you

And like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Never ceases to amaze
That's when I got up and left

If I could paint how I feel
I'd draw bullseye on your forehead
My anger is not misdirected
Unless it somehow misses you

Time spent on hate
Is time gone to waste
I watch you point and click your life away

Cast the stones that I'll gladly catch
And I'll throw them right fucking back
I stand behind the things I say
You type the words you won't say to my face

Time spent on hate
Is time gone to waste
I watch you point and click your life away

It seems you've let me go again (Let go!)
Just like the day you let me in (Let go!)
The best of intentions
You were never mine to begin, begin with

So step away from the fucking screen
See a world outside your scene
Maybe then you will know
And realize the lack of threat you pose

On clearer days I can see the lights from my bedroom door
On windy nights I can smell the lake as it drifts to me from the shore
The traffic lights silently change a thousand times a day
But I'm still waiting
Yeah, I'm still waiting

And if my hand could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

I can't remember exactly when this longing began
But I know it wasn't before the day you touched my hand
Laugh and shout in blissful daze and numbers are exchanged
But, I'm still waiting
Yeah, I'm still waiting

And if my hands could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

So put your hands where I can see them
And shut your mouth
I know who you are
In a world void of feeling or heart
I know that we are the torches in the dark

Let's break this down
Let's make this count
Let's leave this one-horse town
No better time than now

Let's break this down
Let's make this count
Let's leave this one-horse town
No better time than now

The angels dance, like feathers float
They're here to see and to be seen
The clock strikes two, the music slows
And each one slowly dons their wings

Once outside they all pair off
And hand in hand they leave
But I'm still waiting
Yeah, I'm still waiting

And if my hands could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

Would we ever wake up?

Can you hear
The desperate cries that are calling out your name
Twisting your arm
Holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve

Do you feel
This underlying sense of urgency
Or are you as blind as me?

I hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere now

I can't bear the thought of losing
I dread the attention winning brings
And ever since the day I came here
I can stand without your strings

I'm so sick of all these people
But I'm scared to be alone
And if this life has taught me anything
I forgot it long ago

And so I hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

Hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

The heart is something
You can't control
We either choose to follow
Or be left on our own

So we're leaving here on
Our less-traveled road
As our desperate cries grow louder
I know we're getting close, getting close

And so I hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

Hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning

There's a struggle coming, but to conquer, first they must divide
The machines keep humming night and day
How are we so unaware
Why are you not afraid?

Protests are drumming while you turn your nose and roll your eyes
Knee-jerk reactions so ingrained
Judging from an arm chair

Cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss
But there is light and there is dark, then there is us
And whether this world burns, is none of your concern
Caught up in a ticker-tape parade

I have learned to stand up and just to walk away
Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate
Learn to let go, learn to walk away
Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame
But this time I'm here to stay

Gunpowder residue, bright lights and turpentine
True colors shining through, as we are stripped of our exteriors

Now, cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss
But there is right and there is wrong, then there is us
We're falling until

We learn to stand up and just to walk away
Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate
Learn to let go, learn to walk away
Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame
But this time I'm here to stay

Feet first into the quicksand, every day we are surrendering
Never straying from the game plan
I keep hoping you will take my hand and stand up

The water's overflowing, the walls are breaking
But I know where I'm going, that we can make it
And there's a light still glowing and I will chase it
And I've been lost before and I have been led astray

But this time I'm here to stay

I watched the rise and the fall of the common man
I lived to see all our steps walked back
I watched the walls all crash down crumbling
Just to be rebuilt while we slept

We threw swords in the oceans wide and deep
We promise peace but the peace won't last
Because now we forge new blades so nervously
Waiting for this harmony to pass

I stand guard and roam
Like a sentinel and I see it all

I've been awake too long
Wish there was something
That could close my eyes to all that I see
Awake too long, it would be easier to fall asleep

We fell in love but the love kept running out
We followed roads but the roads all end
We lived and learned and learned to live without
Falling from the ladders we ascend

I've seen the eyes of the widows left behind
I've seen the child of a fallen man
And never once did our leaders apologize
For battles they began

Can't look away
Or pretend not to see and so I stay

I've been awake too long
Wish there was something
That could close my eyes to all that I see
Awake too long, it would be easier to fall asleep, asleep

Maybe I would dream if I could sleep
Maybe I'd see what this could be
Instead of what it is
Is there bliss in ignorance
Is this our demise we can't prevent
Should we fall asleep?

I've been awake too long
I've been awake too long
I've been awake too long
I've been awake too long

(I've been awake too long) And like constant vigils
(I've been awake too long) We are burning eternal flames
(I've been awake too long) A surgery, blades in an open heart
(I've been awake too long) And through it all, it all
Every single cut, I've been awake

In a world of uncertainty
The night sky told us all to be patient
But when the ground started shaking
I wondered for how long

There's a place that I'd rather be
There's a voice deep inside of me
Saying the progress we are making
Is not progress at all

Into a world of promises, whoa
Is where we let ourselves been led

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
But may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands

A black cloud hovers over me
Without all this guilt I feel naked
Something about the way it
Wraps its arms around
White snow covers everything
An angel watches over me
Praying, she asks me for a favor
Catch me if I fall

A rush of blood straight to the head, whoa
I wonder what this could have been

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
But may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands
Hey!

No I never meant to hurt you
No I never meant to do you wrong
I stood waiting while the man said move along

We lay the tracks down
But now they rotted
Like a runaway train
We brace for the crash

We were in love once
Have you forgotten?
Like a runaway train
Bearing down upon a gap

We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(and now we brace for the crash)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)

Love like a needle full of methadone
Potent but not real, left you wanting more

Lipstick track marks bleeding wet
Like Montagues and Capulets
For us child the stars refuse to shine
Oh why for us, child, do the stars refuse to shine?

Somewhere strung out on the lam
We wound up back here again
Like unstable chemicals
Combining only to explode

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire, and all the world's a fuse
So don't get close
Trouble and the worth
Am I better off on my own?

Contaminated, quarantined then left alone
A shipment refused, address unknown
A damaged goods they soon forget
The choking dust that we got left
For us all, the stars refuse to shine

Tap the vein and light the match
We burn like stars before the crash
But for you there's still a chance
Just let go

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire, and all the world's a fuse
So don't get close
Trouble and the worth
I'm better off on my own
On my own

Now there's nowhere to run
And yeah there's nowhere to hide
There's nothing under the sun
We haven't already tried

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a hand grenade, pin already pulled so don't let go
As we chase the sun my shadow slows us down
And without me along, you're better off and I know
You're better off and I know

My God is better than yours
And the walls of my house are so thick
I hear nothing at all

I followed you out in the storm
But it carried you off
And I burned every picture of yours
Was that not enough?

My gun is bigger than yours
So let's arm the masses
And see what the bastards do then
Walking tall once set us apart
Now we're down on all fours
Do you cry my name in the dark
Like I do yours?

These storms are getting stronger now
Trusses all bend and sway
Lightning hits, the power goes out in the fray
As the waves crash high
And the shoreline disappears
I will scream to the sky
"Hey, people live here."

My dreams are not unlike yours
They long for the safety
And break like a glass chandelier
But there's laughter and oh there is love
Just past the edge of our fears
And there's chaos when push comes to shove
But it's music to my ears

May you be in Heaven before the Devil knows you're dead
May these winds be always at your back

'Cause when we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
We will look at the ashes
And say, "People lived here."

From the penthouse to the holy martyr
Sea to shining sea
From the coffins full of kindergartners
Is this what you call free?
From the hate that drips from all your crosses
Are your hands so clean?

And the wildfire and it's spreading far
From sea to shining sea

When we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
I will scream to the sky
Yeah I'll scream to the sky
Yeah I'll scream to the sky
"Hey, people live here."

Album  The Black Market
Floating in the clouds, I'm giving up the fight
A voice is calling out, I'm walking into the light

We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast
Feet they barely even touched the ground
We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world
The fury and the sound

I saw it flicker like a television set
Bright flashes of a warning sign
Flipping channels in a world gone static
Eroding away line by fading line

Underwater for years we found
So much harder to swim than drown
The current takes us now we're walking into the light

Are you dying all your life?
(Walking into the light)
Broken, beat, and tired out
(Walking into the light)
You want to live but don't know how
(Walking into the light)
Diagnosis: Sudden life
(Walking into the light)
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light

Woke up floating on a wave of golden sound
Tunnel vision and a great beyond
Heart beating like a rhythm slowing
Down til it's gone an echo of a song

Flat line and a closing bell whisper a warm farewell
The flames are beckoning as we're walking into the light

Are you dying all your life?
(Walking into the light)
Broken, beat, and tired out
(Walking into the light)
You want to live but don't know how
Diagnosis: Sudden life
(Walking into the light)
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light

Don't suppose that you know the way?
Don't suppose that you care?

I see lights up ahead and
Hear choirs of angels ring in my ears
But you know that had you a choice
You would go back do it again
We all have unfinished business to tend

So no I won't go gentle into that good night
You can keep your candle
I'm walking away from the light
Yeah, I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
Now I'm walking away from the light

Diagnosis: Sudden life
(Walking away from the light)
I woke up my heart racing
(Walking away from the light)
I'm at a loss explaining why
(Walking away from the light)
Are you dying all your life
(Walking away from the light)
Then put your darkest days behind
Let life flash right before your eyes
And for the very first time
It feels like I'm walking away from the light

Album  The Black Market
A currency of heartache and sorrow
The air we breathe is stale with mold
To shadows we are slaves digging deeper everyday
But emptiness is growing so old

Headlamps light the tunnels we wander
They shimmer and they dance on the walls
We're lost inside these caves as the chances of escape
Grow slimmer 'til there's no chance at all

This ink it travels from the page
Up my hand into my veins
Choking on the stories I've told
If there are words here left to say
I just wanna let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now
I'm covered in the mess I made
These colors used to wash right out
But now they are a part of me
I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
I need you here, I need you now
Right now

We traffic in the blackest of markets
Trade misery like diamonds and gold
The angst that we exchange for applause and petty praise
Is finally now taking its toll

But there's a world above the ground
A life that we can lead
We're washing off the dirt from our clothes
I don't wanna live without
No I just wanna let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now
I'm covered in the mess I made
These colors used to wash right out
But now they are a part of me
I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
I need you here, I need you now
Right now
Right now

(Black stains)
They mark me like a letter
(Don't fade)
Cracking under the pressure
(Black stains)
Nothing stays gold

But there's a world above the ground
A life that we can lead
But we're lost deep down in these holes
And I have seen the way out
Now I just wanna let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now (black stains)
I'm covered in the mess I made (don't fade)
These colors used to wash right out (black stains)
But now they are a part of me
I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
You're voice it washed the stains away

Woah oh ohh ohhh oh oh
(Washed the stains away)
Woah oh ohh ohhh oh oh

Spray paint the cameras, jam the frequency,
What you kill, just comes alive in me,
Hoods and bandanas make not an enemy,
You can't define us, any way you please!

You make the rules, we make the calls
My conscience clean, my sins absolved

Because I found God (hey!)
In the sound of your factories burning down,
Now I sleep so sound...

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on or let go?

Instead of doing what's right they built higher walls
Where we can't shed a light on true criminals
When business and suffering is one and the same
When laws fail the people, they turn to the flame

I found love (love!)
I found life (life!)
As a thorn stuck in your side,
And you wonder why...

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by, to watch it fall away?

Will you hold up? Did you hold up? Or just let it fall?
Did you let it fall?

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?

When it all comes down,
When it all comes down...

When the lights all go out, and roadblocks go up,
As we sleep to the sound of alarms going off
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?

There's a fire on the borders and it's burning down the walls you built high
There's a steady stream of anger and it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave
And the words say we reap what we sow
So where I bury you I'll build my home
In line to reclaim but we're sick of the wait

We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I watched your fires burn out
The cold dead hands we pried these guns from are yours, woah

We want it all and we want it now
A tide is coming to drown you out
We make ourselves at home
While your body's still warm, woah

Go
Tradition tethers us to rituals and are we all just clocks on the wrong times?
And something triggers each and every time I hear you say
"God bless this place"

But your numbers are dwindling now
Though endangered we'll still hunt you down
With heads on a stake
Long may you reign

We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I watched your fires burn out
The cold dead hands we pried these guns from are yours, woah

We want it all and we want it now
A tide is coming to drown you out
We make ourselves at home
While your body's still warm, woah yeah

There's a fire on the borders and it's burning down the walls you built high
And there's a steady stream of anger and it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave

We want the mother fucking world
And we want it now
Tonight I watched your fires burn out
The cold dead hands we pried these guns from are yours, woah yeah

No I don't wanna wait
I know a better way
So step aside come on
Or better yet just go away
Our chance has finally come
There might not be another one

Now
No we're not gonna wait
We want it now
Yeah, we're dousing the flames
We want it now

On the edges of the sharpest knives
In the middle of the darkest nights
Always knew that I would find you here
In a puddle of the bravest tears

I've seen enough to know it's lonely where you are
Above the crowd
Feet dangling from a rooftop (a rooftop)
She waits from ledges for a voice to talk her down

Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone
Never-ending nights when you're awake
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
To laugh again some day

All that matters is the time we had
Doesn't matter how it all went bad
Never wonder what it might be like
Shut the door, say goodbye

When faced with tragedy
We come alive or come undone
So don't hold back, let it shape you like an ocean
Even the deepest scars in time will fade

Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone
Never-ending nights when you're awake
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
Yeah, we're holding on to laugh again some day

And sometimes you have to go back
To know just where you were then
But we're old enough to know that
What has been, will be again and again

And the bravest of faces are the ones where we fake it
And the roles that we play

Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone
When you are finally awake
Despite the overwhelming odds, tomorrow came

And when they see you crack a smile
And you decide to stay a while
You'll be ready then, to laugh again

Nothing matters but the pain
(We are tragedy, yeah, we are sympathy)
Nothing matters but the pain
You see what you want to see

Nothing matters but the pain
(We are misery, a distant memory)
Nothing matters but the pain
We all learned to laugh again
Yeah, we all learned to laugh again
We all learned to laugh again

Settling in here for the long haul
Can't hide forever is what they say
In with the wind, out with a bang
Meanwhile nothing has changed

With each word slowly uttered
A storm brews in her eyes
A missed shot at the buzzard
Time, whether wasted
Or well-spent, is still time

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don't recognize
But we return here all together

Moments of clarity here are short-lived
Bled through the bandages again
When is a lie no longer white
But black as a day without sun

Passed out in a gutter
Woke up in your arms
Nursed back and recovered
The same touch that heals me
Left a scar

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don't recognize
But we return here all together

And the world works in ways that I never have claimed to know
We got out in front of the weather but it followed
The view from here isn't better but it's all we know
It's all we know

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the edge of the border lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
Who we've become you won't recognize
But we became them all together
All together

I don't like
Devid Lee Roth
That's because
I'm totally goth

I know all about
The planet Hoth
That's because
I'm totally goth

Don't feed me soup
With too much broth
That's because
I'm totally goth

I'm so totally goth, you know
I wear black from head to toe
My eyeliner is also black
My appearance tends to attract
Other folks who are totally goth
So if you're not totally goth
Then you should immediately fuck off

Marilyn Manson is much cooler than Hanson

I am totally goth
I'm so totally goth
I am totally goth

The wheels go round, the beat goes faster
It's my favourite tune on the Sovietoblaster!
And everyone here drinks vodka and beer
And the dancing queen of Kiev, Ukraine
Drives every boy insane!

A crazy professor
With a bag full of food
His 18-year old daughter
(She looks so good!)
A fat businessman
With a unique hairstyle
A contract killer -
(You have to see him smile!)

He's so proud of his gun
Showing it to everyone
On his mobilephone
He's got a picture of his son
There's a mormon preacher -
Black suit and a tie
The train left the station
Kiev, goodbye!
Let's introduce ourselves - we're sitting on a train
That takes us to Berlin from Ukraine

The wheels go round, the beat goes faster
It's my favourite tune on the Sovietoblaster!
And everyone here drinks vodka and beer
And the dancing queen of Kiev, Ukraine
Drives every boy insane!

From Ukraine with love
I'm like a spy on a mission in a
Palace on wheels
With no air conditioner
It's hot as hell
But we don't care
We have two days
And one night to spare
Our small compartment's
Like a telephone cell
Everyone here
Has stories to tell
We are in no hurry
We've got plenty of time
Tell me your lifestory
I'll tell you mine

Another round of drinks
Now take out your guitar
There's a party
In the dining car!

I once used to live here
Now I came back
For these old soviet records
Now they are all in my bag -
Dozens of vinyls
As heavy as bricks
Bringing death to DJs
With all their tricks!

Forget your Top 10!
I've got some LPs
That are 100 times funkier
Than Black Eyed Peas!
Crazy balalaikas from
Nineteen Sixty-Five!
You've been dreaming to hear it
All of your life!

When there's no wodka left
What shall we do, my friends?
Lets forget our troubles
And DANCE!

How did it feel when it came alive and took you?
Out of the black
It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to

I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why
And you didn't care when
You closed every door
And washed away no sin

And I promised you
Like you promised me
But those vows we made
Fucked them up for free, yeah

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to

I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to

I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket

And it's hard, this world
Never lets you go
Deals a crooked hand

Cold fire
Such a cold fire
It's a cold fire
It's a cold fire

It was long after midnight
When we got to unconditioned love
She said, "Sure my heart is boundless,
But don't push my limits too far"

I said, "If love is so transcendent,
I don't understand these boundaries"
She said, "Just don't disappoint me"
-- You know how complex women are

I'll be around
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

It was just before sunrise
When we started on traditional roles
She said, "Sure, I'll be your partner,
But don't make too many demands"

I said, "If love has these conditions,
I don't understand those songs you love"
She said, "This is not a love song,
Thes isn't fantasyland"

(Don't go too far)
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
(Don't cross the line)
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
(Don't let me down)
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker’s diamond
Is a cold fire
(Don't break the spell)
The look in your eyes as you head for the door
Is a cold fire

I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down

I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down

(Don't go too far)
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
(Don't cross the line)
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
(Don't let me down)
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker’s diamond
Is a cold fire
(Don't break the spell)
The look in your eyes as you head for the door
Is a cold fire

I'll be around
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down

I'll be around
If you don't let me down

(It's a cold fire)
Love is blind if you are gentle
(Such a cold fire)

(It's a cold fire)
Love can turn to a long, cold burn
(Such a cold fire)

It was me on that road
But you couldn't see me
Too many lights out,
But nowhere near here

It was me on that road
Still you couldn't see me
And then flashlights,
And explosions

Roads are getting nearer
We cover distance but not together

I am the storm
And I am the wonder
And the flashlights, nightmares,
And sudden explosions

I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish

It's about you and the Sun
A morning run
The story of my maker
What I have and what I ache for

I've got a golden ear
I cut and I spear

What else is there?

Roads are getting nearer
We cover distance still not together

If I am the storm?
If I am the wonder?
Will I have flashlights, nightmares,
And sudden explosion?

There's no room where I can go and
You've got secrets too

I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish

(When I first got in to magic, yeah.)

When I first got into magic, it was an underground phenomenon
Now everybody's like pick a card, any card
If I shot my full load with the first hand I played
I'd be a monkey in a box hangin' with the David Blaines
I be swimmin' with the sharks, mouths full of razor blades
But I'm not, I got out of that game

Escape Artist

I talk 'til I'm red in my face with strain polyps
I'll rock 'til I'm out of my range then raise octaves
I play through the pain and remain conscience
Refraining from commenting on the lame compliments
And the petty criticisms from those who ain't accomplished
Even one fifths of some of this shit I made progress with
I'm leaving naysayers stumped like rain forests
After years of pullin' rabit ears out my pants pockets
I'm not revealin' any tricks of the trade
It's just there ain't no magic in the breakdown baby

In an effort to make 'em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look
none of 'em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I'm sitting in the middle of an unread book
letters are falling apart
but the sentences descend on their own and the wording is permanent
never been missed
I've just been mis-
worded and mis-
interpreted, it's
funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement
results in the death sentences filling my running assignment
I'm just wondering where my time went, it pulled a disappearing act
and every single assistant I ever had got sawed in half

You See I never payed attention
But I can't afford to laugh
'cause I'm lookin' for my break in an autograph for my CAST
but I'm short on staff so all I ask is volunteers in the crowd
show a little bit of audience participation now

When I say hip (what do I say?)
You, you say shut the fuck up we ain't sayin shit!
And I'll respect it
Check it,
In a flair for the dramatic exit
A fashionable entrance
Late to my own arraignment (Oh!)
The self-destructive things that I do for entertainment
My folks gave me this already broken heart as my pallet
While I was out honing my craft you was disowning your talent
That's why you still live at home
And I bought this house off my parents
I'm getting ahead of myself
(gettin ahead of myself)
I see the hair on my back
(see the hair on my back)
I'm on the road reading Kerouac
It's poems versus better raps
I think to myself
What's worth remembering
Versus defending the size of my manhood or confessional canned goods

In an effort to make 'em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look
none of 'em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I'm sitting in the middle of an unread book
letters are falling apart
but the sentences descend on their own and the wording is permanent
never been missed
I've just been mis-
worded and mis-
interpreted, it's
funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement
results in the death sentences filling my running assignment
but none of this is getting told in confidence
I spin confidential records just to hold the listeners attention

I'm a veteran of spacial relationships
I clip ya wings to fit you in head shrinking magician
Shape-shifting reptilian turned body contortionist
Orphanages started offering torches to abortion clinics
I lost acquaintances
And a morgue of lady friends
I gender bent the heaven sent angelic devil boy with God's androgynous
I'm lookin' marvelous but looks can kill
And I'm unsure about my sexual orientations still
Put me in a special kind of case that only breaks if
You hit it with a bouquet of flowers and baby breath arrangement
The vault is vacant
They're all looking for fault or blame
I called my agent
The moment that I caught the train
I let him know, I'm going nowhere, he's invited
If he leaves tonight then he just might help me find it
But this is my burden to bare, not his
And I'm a psychic without a sidekick
Holding the future hostage
A loose cannon standing on the roof top with
A new respect and understanding of bartenders and locksmiths
They call me daredevil but I'm not precise enough
Unprofessional on an amateur level, I love my life too much

It's been a hell of a year, but I'm mentally prepared
To do a dance around the next couple medical scares
I'm Fred Astaire with the metal wearing quickly off my tap shoes
So I step quietly, the way that cat's move
But I'm bear-like. My head trapped in dear lights
You can call me John, I'm writing letters to the dark side of the moon tonight
My lovely Jane, you went away but the pain stayed
So I'm sending you a package to the address where you traded names
I made no claims on the identity theft
I'm more concerned about the home with no amenities left
And it's already a mess. The dust piles like your junk mail
So I eat away depression and crush the scale
You find yourself on the opposite side of the spectrum
Emaciated on a strict diet of bed crumbs
Me? I choose to wallow and I'll just swim in my fat
You...refuse to swallow so I see ribs from the back
This isn't an attack, it's an admission of guilt
I'm living in the past, kissing your ass, sipping your milk
But it's all bone and curdle. I saw stones in a circle
Stood in the middle. Told myself riddles in a robe that's purple
The murder weapon was an icicle
Is that the reason why I'm standing in this puddle with my eyes so full?
I fight feelings like a war on drugs
I'm a chemist with a test tube addiction born through coffee mugs
Our baby now is all growed up
Your car is still dead in my driveway while I wait for the tow truck
And you know what? I know I drove you away
I still don't think it was wrong so I don't know what to say
It's been a tough year. You say that life ain't fair
Well, guess what, baby...life ain't. Thems the breaks
You say that life ain't worth it. But it is. You gotta work it
Nobody's life is perfect

Yeah, you've been dealt a bad hand. Placed against a stacked deck
Been through all the cat scans and bad checks
But I slashed your debt. Not your wrists
And I couldn't help with anything else that became cancerous
Halfway people with a full baby to bury
Took a flame to the papier-mache sanctuary
When the smoke clears...try not to stare into the light
But, also, don't stay in the dark as if that's what life is like
It's just a series of unfortunate events
But the messages we get are more important than death
What's the rush?
I've got a shortness of breath
What's the rush?
Running from you...running from me
It's the rush. The crush. The lust. The love-trust
So what's the trouble? The busted bubble? The unjust?
That's just the way the cookie crumbles. It does suck
But suck it up. We're all looking, but nothing's enough
We used each other as a crutch. The clutch. The shift switches
You couldn't just adjust. You combusted and ripped pictures
This is why I'm not considered a saint?
Well, guess what? ... I ain't

It's been a hell of a year
You said that I ain't there, I ain't care, and life ain't fair
It's been a hell of a trip
You say my mind's unfit, I've been flip, and I ain't shit
It's been a hell of a life
You say that I ain't like the way I write and that ain't right
It's been a hell of an attempt
You say that I ain't meant for promises unkept
Well, guess what, darlin..
I'm a keep keep callin
Guess what, darlin..
I'm a keep keep callin

Vor des Schlafes Schwelle,
wenn du fast die Grenze überquerst,
gibt es eine Stelle,
an der du dich lauter atmen hörst.
Langsam kriecht die Schwere
aus den weichen Kissen, und du weißt,
dass sie dich ins Leere,
bis zum Mittelpunkt der Erde reißt.

Heute, du Bastard,
Zünden sie dich an.
Du selbst trägst deine Leiche
bis zum Ufer, gehst voran:
Dort warten deine Kinder
mit Kanistern, lächeln stolz,
Drei Mädchen und ein Junge,
In der Hand ein Schwefelholz.

Zug um Zug beschreiten
die Gedanken unbekanntes Land,
und die Träume gleiten
in den Abgrund, über den Bettrand.
Du wirst tiefer sinken,
bis du alle Grenzen überquerst,
Trübes Wasser trinken,
bist du deinen Atem nicht mehr hörst.

Du bewegst die Beine,
doch sie gehorchen nicht;
Ein Paar alte Mühlensteine
von untragbarem Gewicht.
Du schleifst deine schweren Schritte
durch den Schlick, bist festgebunden,
während tausend kleine Tritte
über dir dein Bett umrunden.

Heute, du Bastard,
Steht dein Schlaf in Flammen.
Du selbst hast sie gerufen, und

Sie warten jede Nacht auf dich
Am Ufer, voller Stolz:
Die Mädchen und der Junge
Mit dem längsten,
mit dem längsten Schwefelholz.

it's the...; it's a driving force for me...; is to die. It's the only power I can

I want to die in a certain way. And I want to achieve some things.
I wouldn't dare to die with a weak soul, I wouldn't dare to die with a

Weil jede Blume dem Schweiß
Der Morgensonne harrt
Und Gottes Größe nur auf Erden,
Nicht im Himmel offenbart,
Sind Dir die Worte, die Sprache
aller Menschen fremd
ungleich dem Wasser,
das die Jahrzehnte gläsern
in die Täler schwemmt

Hej Sira John,
Flieg' durch die Nebel,
Flieg' auf und davon,
Nur Feigheit fällt,
Ins Herz des Gletschers
führt kein Weg der Welt.

Wie jede Möwe die Klippen
in der Bucht umkreist,
der Wind den Flügeln zur rechten Zeit
den besten Platz im Fels zuweist,
Streifst du zum Klang der Halme
Zwischen den Ufern hin und her,
Frei von Gedanken, frei von Zeit,
in deinem Kopf entspringt das Meer.

Hej Sira John
Flieg' durch die Nebel,
Flieg' auf und davon,
Nur Feigheit fällt,
Im Herz des Gletschers
schlägt das Herz der Welt.

Umringt von Schweigen - klar wie Kristall,
Gefasst in Steine, Staub und Metall,
Erwartet manchen ein alter Schein:
Der Du hinaus willst, das Schiff ist Dein.

Album  Heiliges Herz - Das Schwert Deiner Sonne
Die Lider gleiten lautlos
Wie ein Tuch empor,
Der schwarze Kreis,
Er dehnt sich und öffnet das Tor
Für die Armee des Lichts,
Die Vorboten der Stunde,
In der alles aus dem Nichts entsteht,
Sie bringen frohe Kunde.

Langsam weicht die Nacht
Vor des Morgens Macht
Hinter aller Menschen Rücken,
Weil ein neuer Tag erwacht.
Und sein Schatten fällt
Vor der ganzen Welt
Auf die Knie, als rotes Wasser
Aus dem Herz des Meeres quellt.
Denn das Silber treibt
Das, was übrig bleibt,
Vor die Flamme, die das Ende
In den jungen Himmel schreibt.
Was war ist vorbei,
Gleich gegoss'nem Blei
Weht der Wind die Jahre fort,
Er teilt die Zeit vor mir entzwei.

Ich stehe allein
Umringt von Farben
Sag', wie kann es sein,
Dass man sich abwendet,
Mich Deine Schönheit
Erst hier und jetzt blendet?

Ich lege die Waffen zu Boden,
die Platten und Schilde,
Sie schmelzen dahin.
Das kosmische Auge bahnt sich
Seinen Weg durch die Brust
Bis zu dem,
Bis zu dem, der ich bin.

Zu Füßen, des lodernden Herrschers
Erstarre ich nackt, nur vom
Sande bedeckt
Und spüre den Menschen, der sich
Unter der schweren Haut,
Seiner Rüstung
Seiner Rüstung versteckt.

Die Iris erstrahlt im Glanz alter Momente,
Die gläserne Bühne erbebt,
Als sich der Koloss aus den
Endlosen Fluten erhebt.

Des Ozeans glühende Wunde verstummt
Als sich mir jeder Rückweg verschließt
Und die Liebe ihr Blut über
Flüchtende Wolken ergießt.

Die gütige Stimme der Wahrheit erklingt,
Sie spricht Worte, die Fesseln durchtrennen
Und lässt mich tief im Zentrum
Des Feuers das Ende erkennen.

Oh siehe, das Schwert Deiner Sonne, es steigt
In den Himmel, die Hoffnung zu richten,
Die ihr Haupt vor den fordenden Wellen verneigt,
Es erhebt sich, die Reihen zu lichten.

Von heute an werde ich, von Dir befreit,
Einen anderen Schein in mir hüten:
Ist das Ufer auch fern und der Weg noch so weit,
Trägt das Leben doch stets neue Blüten.

Album  Heiliges Herz - Das Schwert Deiner Sonne
Am Ende meines Lebens stehe
Ich, die Hände in den Taschen,
Vor den strengen Blicken des Gerichts.
Durch dieselben stolzen Lippen
Und die gelben alten Zähne
Zischt es: Ich bereue weniger als nichts.

Von jeder meiner Taten und
Von jedem meiner Worte bis ins
Mark der morschen Knochen überzeugt
Bin ich von Deinen Kindern doch
Das Letzte, das sich heute wie ein
Reumütiger Sünder vor Dir beugt.

Mit der Spitze meiner Zunge
Hob ich unzählige Gräber aus,
Das Tischlein deckt sich jede Nacht mit
Dir, der Erde Leichenschmaus,
In mir wächst Deine Hölle,
Rabenschwarz und scharlachrot:
Ich beherrsche eine Sprache,
Und ihr Name lautet "Tod".

Am Ende der Geschichte stehe
Ich vor meinem Schöpfer, jeder
Satz durchdringt die Stille wie ein Blitz:
Man empfindet nichts als Ekel
Für die Herde, Deine Lämmer,
Das von Dir verlangte Mitleid ist ein Witz.

Ich frage mich, oh Hoheit, und ich
Gebe zu, dass selbst das Beil im Nacken
Meinen Spott nicht mehr kaschiert,
Wie einem, der unfehlbar ist,
Der größte aller Fehler, wie die
Menschheit einem Gott so leicht passiert.

Alles was ich wollte
War die Ausrottung der Rasse,
Jener jeden Stern beschämenden
Und selbstverliebten Masse,
Die sich hinter ihrem Fortschritt
Und der Mähr des Intellekts versteckt
Und gänzlich frei von Einsicht meine
Welt mit ihrem Kot befleckt.

Am Grund der Seele, in meinen Träumen
Ist Schönheit Stille, nichts als Wind in alten Bäumen.
Über den Lärm der Städte, das weite Land
Gewinnt das Lied der Blätter die Oberhand.
Wenn sich die Ähren im Sturme wiegen,
Dann weiß ich: Eines Tages werden wir siegen.
So lasst uns jetzt die Stimmen heben:
Der letzte Stamm wird auch die Menschheit überleben.

An alle Männer und jede Frau:
Gleich welcher Herkunft,
Der Rauch ist grau.
An alle Staaten, alle Nationen:
Wegen der Farbe wird man
Niemanden verschonen.

Alles was ich wollte
War, dass alles, was erbärmlich
Auf das Angesicht der Erde speit,
An Geist und Seele ärmlich,
Aus den Augen, aus den Ohren
Gar aus allen Sinnen schwindet,
Und den Weg in die Bestimmung
Ohne jeden Umweg findet.

Alles was ich wollte
War das Ende falschen Lebens,
War der Abschied von der Eitelkeit,
Die Konsequenz des Strebens
Nach dem höchsten Gut, der Wissenschaft
Nach Macht und Perfektion:
Ich verlange die
Totale Annihilation.

Alles was ich wollte
War der Genozid an restlos allen
Völkern, dass sie wie Figuren
Auf dem Schlachtfeld niederfallen,
Dass sich dieser Boden
Von dem Blut des Abschaums reinige:
Ein Menschenleben ist nichts wert,
Nicht einmal das Meinige.

Name  Das Zeitalter Der Bäume
Artist  Samsas Traum
Album  Heiliges Herz - Das Schwert Deiner Sonne
Wenn der Frost in den Tälern und Wiesen
Mehr dem Krieg als der Kälte gereicht
Und die Herrschaft der stählernen Riesen
Wie die Zeit allen Lebens verstreicht,
Sinkt das glänzende, schwarze Gefieder
Wie ein schweres, betäubendes Kleid
Auf die Städte der Menschen hernieder,
Macht die Samen zur Aussaat bereit:

Denn dies ist der Morgen der Rache
Die Wahrheit erstickt jeden Schrei.
Keine Hure, kein biblischer Drache
Reißt die steinernen Schalen entzwei
In den Straßen, den Häusern, im Zimmer
Keimt beharrlich ein seltsamer Traum:
Dreht sich die Erde auch weiter wie immer
Schafft sich die vierte Hand doch ihren Raum.

Wenn der Wind auf den Bergen die Fäule,
Alle Spuren und Sprachen verweht
Und der Rauch, eine senkrechte Säule
Vor den Flammen der Sonne stillsteht,
Dann beginnt es, das endlose Schweigen,
Jener Klang, den selbst Gott nicht erhört:
Bitte nehmt mich, ich werde euch zeigen,
Dass man Treue weit mehr als nur schwört.

Denn dies ist der Tag stummer Rache,
Die herrschende Rasse verbrennt
In den Öfen für Kranke und Schwache,
Einem Feuer, das Namen nicht kennt,
Das das Schlachtfeld umzingelt und ohne
Jede Reue Eliten bezwingt
Und der Schöpfung zum Opfer die Krone,
Den gescheiterten Übermensch bringt.

Wenn die Asche sich über die Sterne,
auf das Antlitz des Abends sanft legt,
Und der Tod ganz weit weg in der Ferne
Keinen einzigen Zweig mehr bewegt,
Stehen wir auf zerbrechenden Brücken,
Ob millionenfach, einsam, zu zweit,
Fest im Glauben, die Rücken an Rücken,
Sehen zu, wie der Samen gedeiht:

An diesem, dem Abend der Rache,
Gleich ob Bolzen, ob Messer, ob Gas,
Sind die welkenden Körper der Kinder
Blinder Mütter und Väter das Gras,
In das wir unser Fleisch niederbetten,
Frei von Mauern, von Stäben und Ketten
Und als Blutstrom im Herz neuer Welten
Mit der Zukunft Vergang'nes vergelten.

Vor unseren Augen die Berge,
Im Rücken die tosende See,
auf unseren Schultern die Särge,
die Schuhe versinken im Schnee:
Weiter aufwärts, bis zum Gipfel!

Das Blut treibt die Qual
durch Herz und Hand,
Schneller, im Kreise:
Dort, über dem Tal
Liegt unser Land,
Endet die Reise.

Wir tragen die Toten zu Grabe:
Die Absicht, die ehrenhaft fiel.
Der Führer, ein streitbarer Knabe,
sieht uns vor dem Morgen am Ziel.

Er schreit seine Lungen wie Sünden
durch springende Lippen heraus,
um unsere Kraft zu entzünden,
Sein Finger zeigt geradeaus:
Weiter vorwärts, in die Heimat!

Das Blut treibt die Qual
durch Herz und Hand,
Schneller, im Kreise:
Dort, über dem Tal
Liegt unser Land,
Endet die Reise.

Wir stemmen die Leiber den Winden
entgegen, marschieren hinauf.
So sehr wir die Knochen auch schinden,
Der Wille in uns gibt nicht auf.

Nur ich und Du
Sind hier, wir seh'n dem Leuchten zu.
Am ruhigen Abendhimmel steht
Ein brennender Planet.
Ich wünschte, der Moment verstreicht
Niemals, weil nichts der Wärme
Deiner Liebe gleicht.

Selbst zwischen tausend Sonnen
Erstrahlt Dein Herz am hellsten,
Ein Schein, der mich
Auf allen Wegen führt.
Die Netze sind gesponnen,
Mir kann nichts mehr passieren,
Denn Deine Hand
Hat meine Haut berührt.

Der Seele nah, dem Körper fern,
Auf einem abgeleg'nen Stern
Betrachten wir den Feuerball
Und schleudern Tränen in das All

Du siehst mich an
Sehnsucht durchdringt
Den Abschied, in mir spielt
Ein Lied das nie verklingt:

Selbst zwischen tausend Sonnen
Erstrahlt Dein Herz am hellsten,
Ein Schein, der mich
Auf allen Wegen führt.
Die Netze sind gesponnen,
Mir kann nichts mehr passieren,
Denn Deine Hand
Hat meine Haut berührt.

Seit Du als Wind in jedes
Off'ne Fenster wehst,
Seit du als Baum in jedem
Wald der Erde stehst,
Seit du als Fluss in jedes
Stille Wasser fließt
Und Dich als Regen über
Jedem Land ergießt,
Seit Du Dich als das Lächeln
Hinter meinem Spiegel zeigst,
Mit mir in Träumen weit hinauf,
Über die Wolken steigst,
Seit mir das Leben diesen
Einen Anblick bot:
Seitdem verlor ich alles,
Auch die Angst vor meinem Tod.

Selbst zwischen tausend Sonnen
Erstrahlt Dein Herz am hellsten,
Ein Schein, der mich
Auf allen Wegen führt.
Die Netze sind gesponnen,
Mir kann nichts mehr passieren,
Denn Deine Hand
Hat meine Haut berührt.
Mir kann nichts mehr passieren,
Denn Deine Hand
Hat meine Haut berührt.
Mir kann nichts mehr passieren,
Denn Deine Hand
Hat meine Haut berührt.

Der Skizzenblock des Himmels
Wird von satten Farben
überschwemmt,
Die Tropfen deines Schweigens
weben Fäden durch
das Firmament.

Wie Tinte treiben sie durch
Wasser, bilde Flächen,
Sammeln Licht,
Das mit strahlenden Speeren
Fenster in die nassen
Blätter bricht.

Konturen verschwimmen,
Die Luft ist durchtränkt von
Gesichtern aus Regen, der Klang
Vieler Stimmen verwischt
fast die Worte sie mischen sich
mit dem Wind leis' zu Gesang:

Du hast die Macht
den Krieg zu beenden,
Das Auge des Sturms,
es gehorcht deinen Händen.
Du streichst durch mein Haar
Um die Schmerzen zu stillen,
Das Auge des Sturms,
es beugt sich deinem Willen.

Im Zentrum, der Mitte,
Wagt schlummernder Mut
zögernd die letzten Schritte
vom Funken zur Glut.
Er stellt sich den Gewalten,
lässt sich durch nichts halten:
das Feuer brennt weiter,
Egal, was passiert,
Bis der Himmel die Lippen der
Erde berührt.

Du hast die Macht
den Krieg zu beenden,
Das Auge des Sturms,
es gehorcht deinen Händen.

Weit jenseits der Zeit
verharren Momente,
Im Auge des Sturms
Zähmst du die Elemente.
Du hältst mich im Arm,
die Angst zu bezwingen,
der Sturm fährt uns
unter die Schwingen
und trägt uns hinauf.

Wie viel Licht wirst Du noch atmen,
Wie weit werden mich die Strahlen führen?
Weil die Haut um dich aus Glas ist,
Wage ich es nur im Traum sie zu berühren.

Du weißt, dass jedes Wort
an einem dünnen Faden hängt,
Doch ahnst du auch, wie tief sich meine Seele
Im Ozean deines Haars verfängt?
Im Ozean deines Haars verfängt?

Wie ein Geheimnis trage ich Dich stumm in mir,
Jede Faser meines Körpers sehnt sich
Einzig und alleine nur nach Dir.

Wie viel Zeit kannst du dir nehmen,
Um der Wahrheit zu zu hören,
Wie viele Sätze willst du sprechen,
um die Hoffnung stets aufs
Neue zu beschwören?

In mir ist nichts mehr wie es war,
zwar spürst du mich, doch bin ich
unsichtbar.

Die stolzen Wellen treiben mich voran,
Ich schwimm' hinaus soweit ich kann,
den Abgrund unter, den Horizont vor mir:
Je tiefer ich in ihm versinke,
Desto näher fühle ich mich Dir.

Den Abgrund unter, den Horizont vor mir:
Je tiefer ich in ihm versinke,
Desto näher fühle ich mich Dir.

So wie ein Kind dem Ufer
blind und taub den Rücken kehrt
und jeder Pulsschlag eine
Rückkehr an das alte Land verwehrt,
so sind es nicht die Wogen,
die an meiner Brust zerbrechen,
Es sind Rufe, kalte Nadeln,
die im Herzen stechen.

Die stolzen Wellen treiben mich voran,
Ich schwimm' hinaus soweit ich kann,
den Abgrund unter, den Horizont vor mir:
Je tiefer ich in ihm versinke,
Desto näher fühle ich mich Dir.

Die stolzen Wellen treiben mich voran,
Ich schwimm' hinaus soweit ich kann,
denn in der Ferne liegt die Wahrheit über mich.
Ich öffne deine Augen und erkenne
frei von Zweifeln: "Ja, ich liebe dich"

Vor des Schlafes Schwelle,
wenn du fast die Grenze überquerst,
gibt es eine Stelle,
an der du dich lauter atmen hörst.
Langsam kriecht die Schwere
aus den weichen Kissen, und du weißt,
dass sie dich ins Leere,
bis zum Mittelpunkt der Erde reißt.

Heute, du Bastard,
Zünden sie dich an.
Du selbst trägst deine Leiche
bis zum Ufer, gehst voran:
Dort warten deine Kinder
mit Kanistern, lächeln stolz,
Drei Mädchen und ein Junge,
In der Hand ein Schwefelholz.

Zug um Zug beschreiten
die Gedanken unbekanntes Land,
und die Träume gleiten
in den Abgrund, über den Bettrand.
Du wirst tiefer sinken,
bis du alle Grenzen überquerst,
Trübes Wasser trinken,
bist du deinen Atem nicht mehr hörst.

Du bewegst die Beine,
doch sie gehorchen nicht;
Ein Paar alte Mühlensteine
von untragbarem Gewicht.
Du schleifst deine schweren Schritte
durch den Schlick, bist festgebunden,
während tausend kleine Tritte
über dir dein Bett umrunden.

Heute, du Bastard,
Steht dein Schlaf in Flammen.
Du selbst hast sie gerufen, und
du weißt woher sie stammen.
Sie warten jede Nacht auf dich
Am Ufer, voller Stolz:
Die Mädchen und der Junge
Mit dem längsten,
mit dem längsten Schwefelholz.

Baum des Lebens

Dort am Ende der Welt steht ein Baum,
Hält mit Wurzeln die Erde,
Mit Ästen den Himmelsraum.

In seinem Stamm steckt ein Schwert,
Das den Sieg in sich trägt.
Es zu zieh'n blieb verwehrt.

Auf der Flucht kommt der Held an den Ort,
Zieht das Schwert aus dem Stamm
Und damit auch den Zorn des Mannes auf sich, der dort wacht.
Der ihn fordert zum Kampf in dunkler Nacht.

Zieh, zieh dein Los aus diesen Stamm,
Zieh, zieh siegreich fort von hier.

Das Feuer brennt die Seele rein,
Es wird sein Schicksal sein.
Im Feuer wurd' das Schwert gebrannt,
Es hat seinen Herrn erkannt.

Der Hüter des Baums zürnt dem Held,
Durch den Zauber des Schwerts geht der siegreich vom Feld,
Der ihm nahm seinen Schatz, dieses Schwert.
Er ahnt nicht, dass er auch seinem Weib stahl das Herz.

Zieh, zieh dein Los aus diesen Stamm,
Zieh, zieh siegreich fort von hier.

In Liebe windet sich der Held,
Zur Frau an jenem Ort.
Doch soll's nicht sein, dass sie ihn hält.
Die Flucht treibt ihn weiter fort.

Doch bleibt sie nicht allein zurück,
Das Schicksal gibt und nimmt.
Ein großer Held die Welt erblickt:
Siegfried wird ihr Kind.

Euch zum Geleit

Es ist schön, euch alle hier zu seh'n,
Durch dieses Ereignis geeint.
Ich weiß, ihr wolltet diesen Weg nicht geh'n,
Ich sehe, dass der eine oder andere weint.

Vergießt keine Tränen, erinnert euch heiter
An unsere gemeinsame Zeit.
In euren Herzen lebe ich weiter,
Hinterließ diese Zeilen euch zum Geleit.

Mir geht's jetzt gut, ich bin dankbar für alles,
Für jeden gemeinsamen Schritt.

   Wollt ihr mich seh'n, so schließt die Augen,
   Wollt ihr mich hör'n, so lauscht dem Wind.
   Wollt ihr mich seh'n, schaut in die Sterne,
   Wollt ihr mich hör'n, kommt an den Fluss.

Ich liebte Wälder, die Berge und das Meer,
Die Sonne, die durch die Nebelwand dringt,
Mit ihrem Schein die Seele wärmt,
Alle Ängste und Zweifel bezwingt.

Hab mein Leben gelebt, geliebt und gelitten,
bekommen, verloren, genommen, gegeben.
Hab gelacht und geweint, mich versöhnt und gestritten.
Ich bin am Ziel und es war schön, dieses Leben.

Mir geht's jetzt gut, ich bin dankbar für alles,
Für jeden gemeinsamen Schritt.

   Wollt ihr mich seh'n, so schließt die Augen,
   Wollt ihr mich hör'n, so lauscht dem Wind.
   Wollt ihr mich seh'n, schaut in die Sterne,
   Wollt ihr mich hör'n, kommt an den Fluss.

Wenn Musik erklingt, lasst mich bei euch sein.
Wenn ihr die Krüge erhebt und feiert ebenso
Bei helllichtem Tag wie bei Feuerschein.
Gedenkt meiner und dann seid bitte froh.

Hör mich an, brech den Bann!

Worte, Zauberformeln gleich,
Umfassen, fesseln bald den Geist
All derer, die zu schwach,
Die taumeln unter ihrer Last.

Schick ein Zeichen, schick das Licht,
Geweihter Rauch umhüllt uns dicht,
Geweihtes Wasser auf der Haut,
Damit das Eis der Seele taut.

In Nomine! In deinem Namen,
Glüht mein Herz, tobt der Schmerz!
In Nomine! In deinem Namen,
Hör mich an, brech den Bann!

Sieben Tage, sieben Nächte tobt der Kampf,
Götterdämmerung im Geiste führt ihn sanft.
Wird das Schreckensbild verblassen,
Oder er sein Leben lassen?

In Nomine! In deinem Namen,
Glüht mein Herz, tobt der Schmerz!
In Nomine! In deinem Namen,
Glüht mein Herz, tobt der Schmerz!
In Nomine! In deinem Namen,
Hör mich an, brech den Bann!

In Nomine!

Ich seh' mein Bildnis an der Wand,
Dies Bild, das ich so gut gekannt.
Was liegt in diesem Blick?

Es scheint zu sagen: "Sieh mich an!"
Es scheint zu fragen, ob ich kann
Vergessen und vergeben?

Bin ich so, wie du es dir erdacht,
So, wie der Meister hat vollbracht
Dies Bildnis auf Papier?

Bin ich so, wie du es dir ersonnen,
In der Vergangenheit begonnen,
Auch im Jetzt und Hier?

Ich sprech zu dir, mein bester Freund, ärgster Feind.
Steh' mir bei, wenn ich vor dir steh'.
Du warst so oft verlacht, viel beweint.
Steh' mir bei, denn ich gebe mich dir!

Sein Blick durchdringt mich, wäscht mich rein
Und sieht versonnen dort hinein,
Wo die Frage brennt.

Die Brücke zwischen Ja und Nein,
Sie bricht, ich stürze tief hinein,
Gefangen und verloren.

Bin ich so, wie du es dir erdacht,
So, wie der Meister hat vollbracht
Dies Bildnis auf Papier?

Bin ich so, wie du es dir ersonnen,
In der Vergangenheit begonnen,
Auch im Jetzt und Hier?

Ich sprech zu dir, mein bester Freund, ärgster Feind.
Steh' mir bei, wenn ich vor dir steh'.
Du warst so oft verlacht, viel beweint.
Steh' mir bei, denn ich gebe mich dir!

Was einst gewesen, liegt im Stein.
Wie kann ich wissen, was wird sein?
Meine wahre Tür - ist das Jetzt und Hier!

Ich frag' das Bildnis an der Wand:
Es sagt, ich hab' es in der Hand.
Es liegt in meiner Macht,
Zu seh'n, was ich erdacht!

Ich sprech zu dir, mein bester Freund, ärgster Feind.
Steh' mir bei, wenn ich vor dir steh'.
Du warst so oft verlacht, viel beweint.
Steh' mir bei, denn ich gebe mich dir!

Ich sprech zu dir, mein bester Freund, ärgster Feind.
Steh' mir bei, wenn ich vor dir steh'.
Du warst so oft verlacht, viel beweint.
Steh' mir bei, denn ich gebe mich dir!

Von Sturm und Meer gezeichnet,
Die Haut zerfurcht und braun,
Die Augen blau wie kalter Stahl,
Sehnsüchtig heimwärts schau'n.

Zehn Tage und zehn Nächte,
Der See die Stirn geboten,
Und dann den großen Fang gemacht,
Trotz Gefahren, die ihm drohten.

Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut!

Das Weibsvolk steht nervös am Kai,
Und richtet sich das Haar.
Die Kerle steh'n in Grüppchen,
Trinken Biere an der Bar.

Alle warten auf den Augenblick,
Bis die Nacht anbricht,
Bis dort am fernen Horizont,
Die Segel kommen in Sicht.

Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut!

Er hat immer zu erzählen,
Von gar merkwürdigen Dingen,
Von Abenteuer und Gefahr,
Von Meerjungfrauen, die singen.
Von Ungeheuern aus dem Meer,
Die ins Netz geraten,
Von sonderbaren Lichtern,
Von Klabautern und Piraten.

Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut!

Er spinnt das Seemannsgarn zu feinstem Tuch,
Welches wärmt zur Winterszeit,
Wenn Langeweile macht sich breit.
Welches, wenn die Stürme toben und die See geht hoch,
Den Leuten hilft, sie zu ertragen, die lange Dunkelheit.

Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut!

Sie hängen an seinen Lippen,
Alle schweigen still,
Wenn er berichtet von den Reisen,
Sonst passiert nicht viel.

Er erzählt von fernen Ländern,
Die er selbst noch nie geseh'n,
Erzählt ihnen von Begebenheiten,
Die niemals gescheh'n...

Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut!

Er spinnt das Seemannsgarn zu feinstem Tuch,
Welches wärmt zur Winterszeit,
Wenn Langeweile macht sich breit.
Welches, wenn die Stürme toben und die See geht hoch,
Den Leuten hilft, sie zu ertragen, die lange Dunkelheit.

Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut!

Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Er kehrt heim mit der Flut,
Mit der Flut,

Mittsommer

Wenn Licht und Dunkel sich umfangen,
Wie zwei Liebende, die bangen.
Sich berühren im Geheimen,
Nächtens ihre Kraft vereinen.

Wenn ihre Majestät, die Sonne,
hüllt die Welt in gold'ne Wonne.
Lädt zum Tanz der Vater Mond,
Der zeitgleich am Himmel thront.

Dann ist Mittsommer.
Dann ist Mittsommer.

Schließt die Augen und dann tanzt.
Wir fliegen mit dem Sommerwind.
Schließt die Augen und dann tanzt.
Wir tanzen, bis der Tag beginnt.
Schließt die Augen und dann tanzt.
Wir fliegen mit dem Sommerwind.
Komm mit, wohin er uns auch bringt.

Alle seine Macht zum Leben.
Und im fahlen Abendnebel
Glühen leuchtend Augenpaare.
Ringsherum und dann von Nahem
Springt der Funke glühend über.
Macht uns alle gleich zu Brüdern.
Macht uns alle eins im Geiste,
Wild dreht sich die Welt im Kreise.

Dann ist Mittsommer.
Dann ist Mittsommer.

Schließt die Augen und dann tanzt.
Wir fliegen mit dem Sommerwind.
Schließt die Augen und dann tanzt.
Wir tanzen, bis der Tag beginnt.
Schließt die Augen und dann tanzt.
Wir fliegen mit dem Sommerwind.
Komm mit, komm mit, wohin er uns auch bringt.

Die Nacht zieht auf, wirft lange Schatten, unheilvolle Macht.
Der Wind streift sanft der Bäume Wipfel, kühl wie Seide, sacht.
Dunkelheit umfängt mich, nimmt mich sanft in ihren Schoß.
Mein Weg geht weiter, meine Suche nach dem Märchenmond.

Der Spur des Untiers folgend, stets bedacht auf Achtsamkeit.
Es führt mich immer tiefer, in den Albtraum dieser Zeit.
Auf der Reise durch Ruinen, aneinander still gewöhnt.
Das gleiche Ziel verfolgend, die Suche nach dem Märchenmond.

Der große Kampf ist längst vergessen, so lange ist er her.
Er walzte alles nieder, zum Leben keine Stätte mehr.
So viele sind gestorben, ein kleiner Teil hat überlebt.
Zersprengt, ziellos, verloren man ohne Hoffnung schmerzvoll stöhnt.

Auch wenn die Reise mir oft schwerfällt, ich oft ins Grübeln komme und
Mir der Sinn oft nicht ganz klar ist, und mich der Zweifel hart bedrängt.
Der Wille ist vorhanden, hilft, dass meine Hoffnung siegt.
Ich nie aufgeb', ich nie ausweich', das Ziel fest vor Augen seh'!

Ich komm' zurück, wenn die Nächte nicht mehr schwarz sind,
Wenn ich gefunden, was sich still vor uns verbirgt.
Wenn ich gefühlt, wovon die alten Sagen schreiben,
Wenn ich geseh'n, was unsere Hoffnung schürt.

Denn in Märchenmond werd' ich all die Sachen finden.
(Märchenmond) Ich werd' dir etwas davon bringen.
(Märchenmond) Wie eine zarte, süße Frucht.
(Märchenmond) Ich bin dann bei dir, hab' Geduld.

Geheimnisvolle Wälder
Geheimnisvolle Höhlen
Geheimnisvolle Schatten
Sich um Heimlichkeit bemühen
Sie suchen nach dem Einen
Einzigartig blauen Stein
Doch zieht das Schicksal einen jungen Knaben mit hinein

Ein Kleines Dorf und Felder
Fernab vom Weltgeschehen
Der Jüngling wild entschlossen
In dem Wald auf Jagd zu gehn
Doch weder Hirsch noch Hase noch ein Wildschwein kreuzt den Pfad
In Blitz und Donner sich ein Edelstein ihm offenbart

Ich bin dabei mein Herz für immer zu verlier'n!

Komm lass uns kämpfen
Lass uns siegen
Oder gemeinsam untergeh'n

Die Greise aus dem Dorfe
Sprachen oft von goldenen Zeiten
Als Männer reinen Herzens
Auf den edelsten Geschöpfen reiten
Elfen-, Mensch-, und Zwergenvolk noch brüderlich vereint
Der Drachreiter-Frieden herrscht
Der Frühling in den Herzen keimt

Doch kam's wie's kommen musste
Neid und Machtgier setzt die Saat
Auf Hunger nach der Herrschaft
Folgen Frevel und Verrat
Ein Krieg bricht über's Land herein
Rafft ganze Völker hin
Und nicht zuletzt das Drachenvolk
Nimmt dieser Welt den Sinn

Damit die Freiheit und der Frieden nicht nur Träume sind

Ich bin auf langer Wanderschaft,
von Dorf zu Dorf, von Stadt zu Stadt,
mal ganz allein, mal mit Gesell,
Land auf, Land ab, traditionell.

Mit nichts als meinen Stenz bewehrt,
mein Hab und Gut ist fest verschnürt.
Der Charlie an der Schulter hängt,
die Nase meinen Weg mir lenkt.

Am Leib trag ich nur Kluft und Hut,
die Staude und bin Wohlgemut,
mit Fleiss und Spucke zu erwandern,
die Erfahrungen der anderen.

So sammele ich im Wanderbuch,
das Zeugnis meiner Arbeit nun,
spreche zünftig vor, der Siegel pracht,
zu ehren meinen Fremden-Schacht.

Du Tippelbruder, Wandersmann,
du lustiger Geselle,
setz dich zu uns, hab teil daran,
an unserer Feuerstelle!
Schenk dir nur kräftig nach, greif zu,
geniessen wir die Nacht!
Bevor du morgen weiterziehst,
wird gesungen und gelacht!

So wandere ich tagein, tagaus,
bin jahrelang fort von Zuhaus',
bei jedem Wetter drauf bedacht,
zu finden einen Platz zur Nacht.

Und wenn Kuhköppe manchmal lachen,
so schert's mich nicht und meine Sache,
denn einst einheimisch meld ich mich,
dann werd' ich Meister und dann lach ich!

Du Tippelbruder, Wandersmann,
du lustiger Geselle,
setz dich zu uns, hab teil daran,
an unserer Feuerstelle!
Schenk dir nur kräftig nach, greif zu,
geniessen wir die Nacht!
Bevor du morgen weiterziehst,
wird gesungen und gelacht!

Du Tippelbruder, Wandersmann,
du lustiger Geselle,
jetzt ziehst du fort, ich stell mir vor
ich wäre an deiner Stelle!
Der Wind dir um die Nase weht,
in Freiheit, Schritt für Schritt,
ich blick verträumt zum Horizont,
ich würde gerne mit.

Es schlug Acht Glasen, dichter Nebel,
Dunkel herrschte noch die Nacht.
Die Crew schlief auf Gefechtsstation,
Die Segel waren aufgebracht.

Lauernd, leise, kaum Geräusche,
Brise sanft durchs Tauwerk weht.
Abgeblendete Laternen,
Zeigten, wo die Flotte steht.

Unendliche Langeweile,
Warten auf das Tageslicht.
Und das Wissen um die Schlacht,
Sobald der neue Tag anbricht.

Ein Kampf soll's werden bis aufs Blut,
Für Ehre, Gott und Vaterland.
Den Korsen fegen von dem Meere,
Ehe er ins Land gelangt.

Der Ausguck meldet Sichtkontakt,
Der Feind steht Ostsüdost...
"Setzt alle Segel und Signal -
Ihr Kerle, es geht los...!"

Die Welt steht in Flammen,
Ganz ruhig liegt das Meer.
Die Schiffe zugrunde gehen...
Einmal genommen, gibt die See nichts mehr her,
Der Anfang vom Ende spielt hier!

Rümpfe prallen aufeinander,
Fürchterliche Kollision.
Da geht er hin, der Besanmast,
das Takelwerk - auf und davon!

Mit Entermessern und Pistolen,
Musketen krachen tausendfach,
Kam sie dann der Teufel holen,
Fünftausend Mann in dieser Schlacht.

Der Ausguck meldet Sichtkontakt,
Der Feind steht Ostsüdost...
"Setzt alle Segel und Signal -
Ihr Kerle, es geht los...!"

Die Welt steht in Flammen,
Ganz ruhig liegt das Meer.
Die Schiffe zugrunde gehen...
Einmal genommen, gibt die See nichts mehr her,
Der Anfang vom Ende spielt hier!

Des Feindes Kugel suchte, fand,
Es fiel der Admiral!
Er hörte noch vom großen Sieg,
Dann schied er hin, in Qual!

Die Welt steht in Flammen,
Ganz ruhig liegt das Meer.
Die Schiffe zugrunde gehen...
Einmal genommen, gibt die See nichts mehr her.
Der Anfang vom Ende spielt hier!

Und die Welt steht in Flammen,
Ganz ruhig liegt das Meer.

Einmal genommen, gibt die See nichts mehr her.

I should look on Helen's face in hell
When I issue my last breath,
The stories they will tell

They'll say men can be bad but so can women
Men won't say that women swim in
Oceans of truth

In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise

Should've seen the look on Helen's face as she fell,
But she succumbed to him and her soul she will sell
There is no reason that has a meaning
There is no reason that has a meaning

I should look on Helen's face in hell

In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise

I should look on Helen's face in hell

Come to me, come to me. I'll be your friend
Leave sitting alone at home with your open wrists that bleed all over
It's been notable years (apart) now, but that's easy for me
Maybe if I was not so vain, well maybe then I would have seen it

You will find yourself in time; all it will take is some time
Know that all that it will take is some time
I am furthest from the sun, closest to roots of the tree
You're not the only one under shade suffering

You'll hate her forevermore, and you'll love her the same
She'll never understand, because life seems to work that way
The dark DNA intact leaves a stain in your brain
And I am not all that you see, most of it you'd never want to be

Enigma: deplete. I'm begging
Priority: I'm learning
All that is need; I will be
Not enough time for trying

All that you are is much more
Than what you call as your worth
You're who this is for, you're foremost
Don't you forget, I love you

She said, "Why is it that you cannot seem to cough up a reason
As to why you threw me into the winter to freeze?"
I said, "I cannot deliver to you a simple answer
For it's far too complex for my complex to conceive

'Cause I just let you go, to let you go
I ran away, found drugs
Just I don't think you deserve what I was
N'more importantly now, what I have become"
So now you say, you say, you say

"Don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me"

You chase the time apart with alcohol and a fresh vibrant flame
Though I do question the value within the hue
While I'm held in the arms of a friend, nearly drank myself to death
I spill of how it's always been about you

Then that morning we made the sweetest love
I walked you outside to watch the sun
As it rose to resemble you and I
Days later, the moon shone upon your lies
So now I say, I say, I say

"Don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me"

Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Scurry, scurry, scurry away
Hurry, hurry, hurry before
I get carried away

Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Scurry, scurry, scurried away
Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Got carried away

Well, don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me

Goodnight my love, my lovely love
God damn shame to be a traitor
I've got God in a shoebox under
My bed waiting for my finger

We both look better in the dark
So I'll do it while we're sleeping
That way I will not reflect
My father's defining features

The absence of consciousness
Welcomes the presence of
Formulated manipulation, no
And I won't feel a thing if you do not

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar with the devil
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
But I'm caught out in the storm

It's three a.m., I've got you good
I've got you right where I want you
And it must be easy to hold your tongue now
With help from a forty-five

"Next exit, one mile", it read
But you're moving a mile a minute
That gives you around sixty seconds
Before you reach your destination

So where, oh where, where will you go?
And I won't feel a thing if you don't, you don't, no
So where, oh where, where will you go?
Oh, I won't feel a thing if you do not

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar with the devil
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
But I'm caught out in the storm

Your safety came with distance
But you foolishly fell into consistency
Place your hand where it does not belong
And I'll be a reminder of your size

Your steady way mirrors the end
The vibrance that fills the pillow behind the head
The one you chose to live within
The one that said, that one that says

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar, familiar oh
(With the devil, with the devil, with the devil, with the devil)
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain

Well, it rained today inside of me
Winds of dismay, they blew me away
And I felt the change in the weather
It be my blame to place, well, it's over, it's over now

Don't tell me, don't tell me this is for good
And the leaves will never change
I'm waiting, still waiting for your face
To exceed a picture frame
It's four years and a work week to regret
And blame you all over again
And the rest of my life to sleep
And dream of what it could have been

Broken is more now than broken ever was then
Something with some form of fix has gone and grown hopeless
So invent the tools to mend years, years, years of negligence
Or the ability to forget because it's over, it's all over now

No, you wouldn't believe, oh no

And in a period of time (period of time)

Dress up in your best
So I can be proud of you
And never believe I won't turn on you
And never believe I do this for you

You're leading me on again
And I find it
Yeah, I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me

How I wish I could be rid of this ennui
Make you regret and make you afraid of me
And never believe I do this for me
And never believe I'll do this gently

Here she's coming and she's drunk again
She's only seventeen
Her daddy said "Well that's enough of that
Come be my little queen"

And now he's touching her wrong again
He's gonna give her disease
He never wanted it anyway
He only does as he please

Won't you tell her that I said I'm the one
I couldn't hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I'm the one
And I don't deserve her

Here he's coming and he's drunk again
He's on amphetamines
Scratch his nails down the other leg
'Cause you're my little queen

And now he's touching her wrong again
She's only trying to get by
He never wanted it anyway
He never soils the child

Won't you tell her that I said I'm the one
I couldn't hurt her like everyone

Will I be ashamed, of cryin'
And I know it's never been the way that I described
But I am afraid, of tryin'

She's the one who keeps me all excited
She keeps me beggin' for more
She's the one who deems me uninvited
Now it's over

Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawlin' my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end

Now I find that I am weaker fare

Wish I could be the one you could be proud of
I'm losing heart again
Wish I could show you what you think I'm made of

Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade

I am a perfect sale
Just wrap me up with your bow and flowers
I will neglect to tell
I'll sell your story that we love each other

Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I'll sing my last refrain

Why don't you let me be
And I'll pretend I'm well
'Cause you're too blind to see
And I'm too tired to tell

And in your apathy
Your head begins to swell
Another tragedy
That you're too cold to feel

Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see
It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for you
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing, I know it's me you fear
If you want me hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave them where they lie
And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me"

I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come sit by the fire and play a while, but you can't stay too long
It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for pleasure
I see my heart explode, it's been eroded by the weather here
If you want me hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy

Watch it blow my mind
It's something I am ill-prepared to remedy
But let it slow the time
It takes to die
And close your eyes to your enemy
Defy!

Self-made millionaires won't take ideas
From all the little plebeians
Just suffocate with smiles
And force fed lies
And close your mind to reality
Deny!

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lose what I'm feeling to them
And not feel anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
Tonight!

So you make the simplest mistake

And fearlessly you deny your involvement in my demise
But give me your open hand

Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell

Listen to the sound
Listen to the sound and echoed
Listen to the sound and echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence"

Were you praying at the Lares shrine?

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

We found you hiding, we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand
Your former glories and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

I need you any time
And I'm breaking down inside
Oh Lord, I'm breaking down inside

You cover me with all your hopeless little fantasies
I never had before
No, I never had before

And now I'm living in my own reality
'Cause of the things you did to me
Oh, the things you did to me

You're like a burning flame
And I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same

You're like a burning flame
And I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same

You're like a burning flame
And I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same

You're like a burning flame
And I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same

You're like a burning flame

No, I'll never be the same

You're like a burning flame
And I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same

Nine ball in a broken glass
Put the pedal to the metal on a piece of ass
I know it doesn't mean that much to me
But think about all the possibilities
Making it, faking it, turn around, taking it
My condition is mistaken
It always seems to sneak up from behind
I must be fucking blind

Overload, you're my overload
Overload, you're my overload
Overload, you're my overload
Overload, you're my-ay overload

Come and look inside my head
In my position I'm better off dead
Get nowhere fast by lying on my back
It's like a fucking heart attack
I know it's much too good to last
That's why I'm living in the past
Where everything is black and white
And I'm always right

Overload, you're my overload
Overload, you're my-ya-ay overload
Overload, you're my overload, now baby...
(Overload), my-ya-ay overload

Coming down on a lithium overload
Try to make it now
I take it way too slow
Wrapped up in a celluloid daydream
But I don't know what it means
I know it's way too good to last
That's why I'm living way too fast
Don't care about anything but myself
Fuck it

Overload, you're my overload
Overload, you're my overload
Overload, you're my overload
Overload, now, overload, now overload

Overload, you're my overload
Overload, you're my-ya-ay overload
Overload, you're my overload, now baby...

Whatever happened to the life I had in your eyes?
I guess I died and I started to believe your lies
Like the voice that I heard in the night
If you think I'm crazy then you're goddamned right

I need to get out of this mess you put me in
And I think is where I'd like to begin
Well I, I really doubt that you think that I would be fine
Well, c'mon baby, now it's temptation time

You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamned right

You didn't happen to save my soul
As it went out the door with the rest of my goals
Well, I just decided that I might like it back
And I'm as serious as a goddamned heart attack

Well, now baby, I tried to make it plain
When I said I was getting tired of these stupid little games
Well, it's pretty simple, if you try to keep in mind
Well now baby, it's temptation time

You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamned right

You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamned right

I didn't mean to cause you any grief
But the things that you do to me go way beyond belief
Well, I never thought that I'd feel like I was dead
But your voice is like a bullet in my goddamn head

And I need to feel wanted, I guess anybody would
But you treat me like a child and that just ain't any good
Well, I just want to have the things that I think are mine
C'mon baby, it's temptation time

You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamned right

You fucked up, it's easy to see
But I don't know what that has to do with me
'Cause I'm knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I'm crazy, then you're goddamned right

En la oscuridad de mi frustración
Cuando la esperanza está en peligro de extinción
Un brote de luz en la multitud
Me devuelve las ganas de gritar

Victoria, he sentido la victoria
Se aproxima un nuevo despertar
El hastío erupcionó al volcán
En las calles de cualquier gran ciudad
Desde el sol emanan libertad

Que agradable sensación caminar al mismo son
Rodeado de almas exigiendo dignidad
Somos el detonador, esperando la explosión
Que derribe la puerta y entre el sol

Victoria, he sentido la victoria
Se aproxima un nuevo despertar
El hastío erupcionó al volcán
En las calles de cualquier gran ciudad
Desde el sol emanan libertad

En época de recesión, está al acecho el tiburón
Se alimenta de miedo, paro y desesperación
La soberania, que dulce sueño
La democracia, es solo un juego
Que persevera los privilegios de los políticos y los banqueros

Despertad: Víctimas de su especulación
Despertad: Que el miedo no te impida la reacción
Despertad: Contra el hambre nos ofrecen represión
Despertad: Ya no nos queda mas, a la revolución

Nos quieren convencer, infectan la opinión
Que todo fue un sueño de un pueblo soñador
Hay que reactivar toda la ilusión
Avivar las llamas de la rebelión

Victoria, he sentido la victoria
Se aproxima un nuevo despertar
El hastío erupcionó al volcán
En las calles de cualquier gran ciudad
Desde el sol emanan libertad

Victoria, victoria, victoria
Levántate y grita...
Victoria, victoria, victoria
Levántate y grítalo ya

Seis millones de judíos aniquilados de la forma mas cruel
Un genocidio imperialista por ejércitos fascistas, de la historia hay que aprender
Las víctimas se han convertido en los verdugos se vuelven del revés
Colonizando territorios Palestinos, de nuevo atentando a la sensatez

Muertos muertos en nombre de quién?
Muertos muertos de Israel de Yave
Muertos muertos en nombre de quién?
Muertos muertos de Israel de Yave

Que harías tú si te echaran de tu casa sin derecho a rechistar
Pisoteando tú cultura, sumergido en la locura por perder la dignidad
Palestina esta sufriendo en el exilio la opulencia de Israel
Por un gobierno prepotente, preparado pa' la guerra, por tu ya sabes quién

Muertos muertos en nombre de quién?
Muertos muertos de Israel de Yave
Muertos muertos en nombre de quién?
Muertos muertos de Israel de Yave

Piedras contra balas una nueva intifada en Cisjordania, Gaza o Jerusalem

Quién podía imaginar?
Que David fuese Goliath
Quién podía imaginar?
Que David fuese Goliath

Intifada, Intifada
Intifada, liberacion

No confundas mi postura, soy ateo y no creo en ningún dios
No diferencio a las personas por su raza, su cultura o su mierda de religión
Solo cundeno el sufrimiento, la injusticia y el abuso de poder
Palestina es sometida a la mas terca de las guerras, la opulencia de Israël.

Oil remove
Shred, tear
Radiation, vapor air
It's the fear
So unclear
Man in motion
Going nowhere
In our homes
Stuck in the face
Spread the dirt to populace
Yellow journal, yellow journal
Set the pace, feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort
So insidious, off the point
Simple solution
Never confusion
Sport a gun, kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought
So receive me, had enough
Lock me up!
Lock me up!

Rot and assimilate
Hot to annihilate

(tear your face)
Rot and assimilate
So hot to annihilate

[is it safe?]

Deviation, tonic mess
Prolonged existence, innocence
See he who speaks
Isn't weak
Wheelchair, future so to speak
Bubonic plague
The truth of AIDS
Community, avoid decay
In the trench of pestilence
The bible screams
Announce your faith
Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal
It's all sensation
Protect design
The moral plan
Infallible
As propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back

Hot to assimilate
[XXX] (go nowhere)
Rot or annihilate

Hot to assimilate

We'll rot or annihilate

Agony
Inner-thinking brain
Clanking change
Growing pain

Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age

Protect design

Infallible
No propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back

Agony profusely stains
The inner thinking of the brain
XXX Accusations
Clanking change
Experiments with groans of pain
It's all preferred that no one blames
The terror in an animal screams
In cages our future
The answer's insane

Rot and assimilate

So hot to annihilate

Desperate, deranged
Talking in my sleep again
Eyes twitch, retain
A sentimental something
Looked torn
And we burned and burned
I was a cinder body soul
In my dream

Breakdown amid the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Responding disillusion
Encrusted cruelty
Describe why nails enclose me
Eating oh so easily
But there exists a lot of reasons
To support fatality

Abstinence possessed
Hardly what you think it is
Hearts beat, positive
(My heart beat)
Provided there's progress
Ignorance does insist
Of the right coffin
Took some food, offered me
Can't see myself, drank the wine
Wished the feverish burst of terror

Breakdown amid the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Insist that nothing happened
Chilled bloodless fatigue
Recharge with bitterness
Fanatics beckoning
Mistook a look impassioned
Absorbed with clarity

Consciousness
Drifts away
(From me)
Discarded memory
Packaged shelf life
Bad display

Breakdown amid the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Insist that nothing happened
Chilled bloodless fatigue
So pound the nails in tight
Eyes screaming out of sight
Against the grain like curtain
Unbearably alive

Misty eyed

Metal rain collapse
Crawls out
Which way the will go
Harness to ever last

Wallowing to test the past
A truth
At times so shallow
Develop an attitude

More time
Decay, lapse in
Fortify thyself, cut off
Inbred and forever more

What a way to end the game

Failing, bleeding eyes
Caricature of pain
Distant, so distant
Melting in the rain

Cold war
Flies forth
On wings of destruction
An orgy of missile tests

A mortifying flash
Huddled
Round the radio-active
Console to control

The lives of the young
Levels of toxic waste
Disgrace
Yet tolerant

Of all that's been done
Built up for a future race
A race
That's never won

Falling from on high
Meet the maker's face
Distort, forget time
Forever leave this place

An atom fuse
Shortens
With man's progression
Decipher what's relative

A legal bureaucrat
Motions with a tender finger
Who's poverties
And who's will be next

Man in a cave
Further action left at that
Two gaping holes
A dripping carnivore

Nature's regret
The law of things so brutalized
An enemy
That need not

What a way to end the game

Third world
Make peace
A visionary
Repress the weak, repress the weak, repress the weak, repress the weak, repress, repress

That's all there is

A hint of gleam
A halo of old jaded weakness
Corruption
Runs harmonious

Taken by extremes
Doorway
Extinction pleases
Repression is based on love

For all length of time
Full of elemental powers
Inbred and not brilliant
No fortune could buy this

Is this pure reality?

Drowning in speculation

Even told when waters older
More polluted never
Drink the murky media
To plumb the depth of time

Anyone
Anyone
Anyone

What of human frailty
Visualize with clarity?
Past the sanitation
To the childish flesh and bone

Bleaching sticks and stoner ribs
Pukes up the gallow's laughter
Stage the mighty media
Blessing this sanitation

What is this supposed to hold?
Freedoms crush, disparaged souls?
Despot dug in yellow cake
And failed to certify it

Crippled son to pass it on
A hatred fed on hatred
Redefy defensive form
As if to never see that

What is real?
Canned I feel,
Less important than today
Anyway, is it worth the slaughter?

Sit and feel absolutely zero suffering
A condition worth denying

Pasted carcass, killing fields
Body parts off dolls that bleed
Who was once committed
Pulling wings off flying things

Feeling bold to knot put over
Twisted ever after
Hissing faded left alone
To replicate the lie

What is real?
Ask the dream
Some dim shift, a rift within
Funniest seems a distant damp ring

Fitting end
Destination: ego
Death within
The condition: dear dementia

Two path given
Pure force downs
Turns a screw
Crawling back

In turn space
A time to intrude
In turn peace
Assuring a future

Silent noise forming sound like silent noise
Silent noise screaming hints retaliation

Heinous plans in sides remain
Taking downs, taking aim
Filling curses
Two conditions back upon itself

Pass it off as good intentions
Leaving marks hard to heal
Reassisted retrogressions
Leaving tracks, path reveals
Sample act, reflected clears
Noticed nought while leaving hears
Nuisance labels paranoia
So stupid how perceived that way

Silent clause shredding flaws
Hungers knawing
Silent flaws
Forever laughter silence knows

A shaman stands retreating
All is over, evermore
Smoke the curse
Your creation back upon yourself

Pushes distress
Closer to the edge
One time cracks
Lights the walls

Worry wasted hearing clouds
Up above the chatter
Digging deep insider storms
To find the inner patience

Erasing shadowed gifted ruin
Haste retracing promised news
Leaving statement meant as nothing
Starving your words with no excuses

Excuses
Excuses
Excuses for excuses
Excuses for excuses

Silent truth asserts its proof like you abhor
Silent truth asserts its proof
You abhor

In nervous convulsion crouches infant ape
Trembling in mother's shit
Caged, eyes tearless, filled with contempt
Clinic mask, experiment with life and death

Smell, lingering, noxious, mixed scent, anxiety
Omnipotent doctor grinds the cage door
Revealing love's primal instinct taken away
The tiny face terrified

Rant and rave, smash your head against the cage
Vacuum clicks on high

Conscious through the pain, pass off as humane
White coat seems so clean
Most dirt bleached out
Out of greed

Force the point of habit,
Eyes burn in a rabbit
Push the pain test button
Spine's cut

Trip mucous inflection, more die
Pills each day
What goes around comes back stronger
Tap into the brain, break the skull again

Smash, price, research rat, lab rent paid in flesh
More ill, drug store sales, sharpen the knife
Emphasis on money, new disease every day
End is seen and coming, research turns its back to gain

Crush the spine, genocide
Kitten drags its dead limb
Continuing all suffering
It will come back and win

Shock, paralyze, turn trauma
Burns out the will to live

Kaum verstand ich euch
Doch wenn wir in der Scheiße sitzen
So verstehen wir uns gleich

Keine Gefühle, jeder ist mal dran
Daß man vor Kälte kaum noch sitzen kann
Zu kalt!

Wenn das Geschwür groß wird
Und man kein Gegenmittel hat
Holt man sich gleich um die Ecke
Eine Portion Wärme ab

Keiner hat den Mut zu reden

Du hast nie geglaubt, du müsstest felsenfest wissen
Wohin du gehörst
Du entscheidest dich auch gegen den Rest
Und dem, der sich an dir stört
Manchmal denkst du, das paßt nicht zusammen
Obwohl alles eindeutig schien
Du glaubst an die Kraft, dabeizubleiben
Und schmeißt nicht alles sofort hin
Und zweifelnd, was du so oft bist
Weißt du, daß der erste Schritt
Immer dein eigener ist

Und Ernst Zweifel sagt dir: geh

Du bist zwar politisch und ohne zu denken
Kannst du dich gegen andere wehren
Doch du hast dich entschieden, Dinge selber zu lenken
Auch wenn sich andere beschweren
Du glaubst nicht an Gott, doch in manchen Momenten
Spürst du, daß es da etwas gibt
Du denkst nicht so tief und weißt
Nichts kann falsch sein, was sich liebt
Und zweifelnd, was du so oft bist
Weißt du, daß der erste Schritt
Immer dein eigener ist

Und Ernst Zweifel sagt dir: geh

Früher warst du schnell und dachtest, Veränderungen passieren
Von heute über Nacht
Jetzt weißt du, wohin, doch über den Weg
Wird ständig nachgedacht
Manchmal hast du das Gefühl,
Daß grad der Zweifel dich kämpfen läßt
Du hast Hunger, und suchst, und was vorbei
Du hälst nicht mehr daran fest
Und zweifelnd, was du so oft bist
Weißt du, daß der erste Schritt
Immer dein eigener ist

Und Ernst Zweifel sagt dir: geh

Der äußere Feind ist überall, wo du ihn suchst

Doch so gut es geht wirst du kein Teil von ihnen
Kein Bestandteil sein
Handlungsspielraum eingeengt
In die Jacke reingezwängt
Wenn niemand und keiner was verändern kann
Reiß' den Verstärker auf, leg' die Gitarre an
Brüllen, zertrümmern und weg
Brüllen - weg

Du bist müde vom Reden, dem Versuch zu verstehen
Zuviel schon verstanden, drehst du dich um zu gehen
Brüllen, zertrümmern und weg
Selten das Gefühl, du tust was du willst
Hast du oft das Gefühl, du tust was du mußt
Doch am zweiten Tag, hast vier Wünsche frei
Geht die Ohnmacht an dir vorbei
Sie wünschten, sie könnten für immer sein
Und bauen ein Haus aus Lügen
Ich hör' sie, ich seh' sie, im Radio, im Fernsehen
Wen können sie damit betrügen?
"Reichtum ist für den, der ihn will"
"Das Paradies - wenn du's verdienst"
Du erinnerst dich, in diesem Land
Hast du einst das Paradies verbrannt
Brüllen, zertrümmern und weg

Verbranntes Herz, leeres Gesicht

Es ist sehr einfach, es liegt auf der Hand

mit wilden Augen sie von überall kommen
um sich zurückzuholen, was wir ihnen genommen

Der Faschismus hier in diesem Land
Nimmt allmählich überhand
Wir müssen was dagegen tun
Sonst lassen die uns nicht in Ruh'
Wenn ich die Bullen seh' mit Knüppeln und Wummen
Jedesmal sind wir die Dummen
Die nehmen uns fest, stecken uns in den Knast
Doch das steigert nur unseren Haß

Refrain:
Ein Drittel Heizöl, zwei Drittel Benzin
Wie '68 in Westberlin
Diese Mischung ist wirkungsvoll
Diese Mischung knallt ganz toll
Wir wollen keine Bullenschweine

Dies ist ein Aufruf zur Revolte
Dies ist ein Aufruf zur Gewalt
Bomben bauen, Waffen klauen,
den Bullen auf die Fresse hauen
Haut die Bullen platt wie Stullen
Stampft die Polizei zu Brei
Haut den Pigs die Fresse ein
Nur ein totes ist ein gutes Schwein

Rot setzte sich die Eisensonne in das Land
Und ein Wind wehte wie blau vom Meer
Und wehte und wehte von weit weg ein Heer
Und drehte ein Totenschiff an den Strand
Denn der Blutstoß hat sie Mann um Mann
Vom Ende der Welt zum Anfang getrieben
Um sich die Herzen mit Gold aufzufüllen

Viva La Muerte ist ihr Kettengesang
Und noch heute bebt das Land von dem Klang
Viva La Muerte ist ihr altes Gesicht
An dem Tag für Tag dieses Land zerbricht

Da wars, als ständ' die Sonne still
Und Zittern fiel selbst die Bäume an
Und der Blutstoß rief sie Mann um Mann
Und die zitternden Knie auf die Erde gesetzt
Sind Mann um Mann in das Land reingehetzt
Um dem Land die Seel' abzureißen
Um sich durch die Mitte der Erde zu essen
Um der Frauen Brüste zu schneiden
Und sie dann weiter wie Wild auszuweiden
Denn der Blutstoß hat sie Mann um Mann
Vom Ende der Welt zum Anfang getrieben
Um sich die Herzen mit Gold aufzufüllen
Um sich die Herzen mit Gold aufzufüllen

Viva La Muerte ist ihr Kettengesang
Und noch heute bebt das Land von dem Klang
Viva La Muerte ist ihr altes Gesicht
An dem Tag für Tag dieses Land zerbricht
Viva La Muerte ist ihr Kettengesang
Und noch heute bebt das Land von dem Klang
Viva La Muerte ist ihr altes Gesicht
An dem Tag für Tag dieses Land zerbricht

Yeah

Black dirty teeth in the crease
Was the proof too good to be believed?
Is the cunt with the tongue
Who belongs on broken knees?

So far it occurs to me
That everybody in the world is afraid of me
Just one more sin and down we go
But that the news is out and I think I'm going to
Kill myself, or fuck myself
Or tell myself about the only thing that matters now

We bury what we fear the most
Approaching original violence
Is the silence where you hide it?
'Cause I don't recognize you anymore

To each his own
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
If this is over you can tell me it's no use
Use, just tell me it's over

Today we will deceive our better selves
Into assimilating pain from something else
Put on your face and show me why
Behind the scenes we had to simply comply
Now the community doesn't feel any better than it used to be
I wanna be a judge in a criminal case
You covered up, did you cultivate?
Be yourself, not yourself
Know yourself, 'cause no one seems to know you now

We carry what we can't control
Approaching original violence
In the silence there's a nihilist
Who doesn't care and never did

To each his own
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
There comes a time when we can't take the same abuse
If this is over you can tell me it's no use
Use

Drug out, pissed on, everything's the same
Bitch and moan, It doesn't matter, nothing's going to change
I don't wanna watch another brother fucking die
So discarded, fallen by the side
Don't tell me it's the only way
Just another reason why you never take the bait
The trials, the scheming, the burden of the beast
Both your faces turn your back on everything
You fought to save a dream

Now that it's over
When this is over

We are the angels' fear to tread
Approaching original violence
We're the silence, we'll deny it
We can't continue on like this

To each his own
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
There comes a time where we can't take the same abuse
My God, it would've taken just one word to stay from you
Now that this is over, you can tell me it's no use
Now that this is over, you can tell me it's no use
Use, just tell me it's over

It doesn't matter what you say
It doesn't matter what you do
We can't continue on like this

Yeah

Rise
Half alive and stark-raving free and maligned
For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised

It's strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind
It blows my fucking mind

These days, I never seem to get enough
I'm tired of this shit- I want to go home
Don't waste my fucking time
Don't waste my fucking time

Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils
This planet isn't special, collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment I know is on my way

So cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It's second hand but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words
"You form a line to formalize the former lies."
And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound and it was sitting there
Surrounded by the garbage and the stains
Another victim of the refuse

Now I've been saying this for years but you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it
Androgyny and insults- you try so hard to be difficult
You want to win the war? Know what you're fighting for

Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It's second hand but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

With angel eyes and demon seeds
You're missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you see
The last man standing gets no pity

Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Come on over
Come unglued
It's not easy to see all of you

Help yourselves
Help is on the way
Well, there's nothing to lose
So now I have something to say

Maybe we can all recognize a moment of sadness
Maybe we can finally agree on the same point of view
A long time ago we believed and we were united
So the last thing on earth I am ready to do is say
Goodbye

A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us
This hasn't torn us apart, so nothing ever will
How can we know where we are if the sun is behind us
But this moment will show us the rest of our lives
No one is going to save us this time
No one can know what we're feeling so don't even try

It's been years since anyone could be a friend
It's the fear that kills the feeling, in the end
Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die?
If rain is what you want, all you have to do is close your eyes
Just close your eyes

I am watching resurrections start to crawl
Is there any chance in Hell? Any chance at all?
Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there?
If rain is what you want, then take your seats, enjoy the fall
Enjoy the fall

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
Is the panic, the static
I've come back from the dead
But my cities will never sleep again

In these diamonds we're left with coloured glass
As pressure takes its toll, we will outlast

But you can't break my heart
As long as I can be myself, I'll never fall apart
And you can't take me in
If I'm not broken, break me down
So I will never feel alone again

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
Is the panic, the static
I've come back from the dead
But my cities (will never sleep again)

My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again

She's sticking needles in her skin
I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy

But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see

Will she ever find, one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world
No one hurts this pretty girl but her

Oh, she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
Ooh, I'm not insane
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me)

She's drowning in herself again
My God, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way

She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers; it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head
Something tells me I'm the one who's kept

Loud, so volatile
A little better than her mind defiled
Who I need to be
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me)

We were meant to be together
Now die and fucking love me
We were made to hate each other
Now die and fucking love me

Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me

I know why Judas wept, motherfucker!

The fire's burn on the summit
Shining a light on the ones I've killed
Survivors' guilt undetermined
I can murder the world in all the blood I've spilled

Banishment, sequestered and conquered
To hell with your intelligence
Just figure out your common sense
No one is bulletproof

Yeah

I'll eat the skins of my brothers
The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall
Can I fill in the cracks with these feelings
With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all

Selfishness, take granted for everything
What more could you ask for?
It doesn't matter anymore
No one is bulletproof

Yeah

Can you feel the cold?
Fortune never favors the old
Tired of defending myself
Go complain to somebody else
Somebody else

Yeah

The monsters in your madness are the voices in your head
They're scratching at your windows as you hide beneath the bed
You live like fucking heathens, so you'll die like pagan Gods
In between the poisons and the pure
Contagions and the cure

NINE - FOR - SURE
NINE - FOR - SURE
NINE - FOR - SURE

I got a bone that's dead inside of me
It's a rotting sink that I don't need
Feel free to vent your denigration
I can't believe I'm saying this

I'll live with my regrets
I'll die by my decisions
I'm not your fucking superstar
Keep it close, you're going way too far

Let's skip all the histrionics
Not again, not another excuse
The epidemic is co-dependent
Biting off more than your mouth can chew

Don't forget to convalesce your secrets
I don't want to be a man today
For all you know I'm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey

I'm going to make you cry tonight
I'm going to make you hate me

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me, what am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home

Your association finds you guilty
Starting with the end of the day
Black and white is such a fascist feeling
Right or wrong and nothing to say

The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
Unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred
Fuck it all, light the acetylene

No other choice, I can't explain
Life keeps taking things away

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me, what am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home

The tough guys who came to kill, but stayed to rape and ravage.

The future's here, I'm past my prime
When the evidence came, I committed the crime
Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the bible
Who could ask for a better disciple

What's the point, I'm not sure I can
I'll never dig another grave, I'm afraid of what I'll find
If it hurts, then you're too old
I'll take your shit and give you fucking gold

I'm going to make you cry tonight
I need you to hate me

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still don't know)
This life has shown me, why am I here? Sad and lonely
The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home

But now it feels like home

The ghosts have given up
Familiar haunts have had enough
Too much thought will give you doubt
And now they found you

It's safer in a cage
They can't tell you what to say
All your dreams come with a price
So they own you

But what did you expect?
Was it too much to protect?
Did you understand they had selfish intentions?
When they were pulling you in opposite directions

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground

We are the override
Oh, we are the override

The dead don't know, the dead are lonely
A fascination fades
When this mercy execution
Says it's over

You follow as preferred
Now their plans are undeterred
Who can bring them in to supersede?
It's over

Even hate starts out as love
Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
When all that's left is the emotion you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground

We are the override
Oh, we are the override, yeah

You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back
Floor to the pedal and lock what you act
Covered in sores, you cannot be the one
You are the answer to why we have risen

You are not the way
You are judged to being afraid
You are simple and unchanged
We believe you should give up
Give up
Give up

God and his mercy will take you for granted
When all that's left is the life you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground

Wallow in the winter of it
Discover what you truly covet
Underneath and far above it
You slither in all kinds of shit

How could you forget about it?
Did you think you could minimize?
This is the age of consent
You'll get a day in the sun before I kill your fucking lights

Burn up in your atmosphere
Burn up in your utmost fear

Desecrate your temples
Only Hell and hate remain
Don't look for crows to scatter
Prepare for Judgement Day

We are kill gods!

The kings are falling down
Can I find a way to get there?
Bury your head in the ground
Will you falsify for your fair share?

When it's done, it's done - plus negative one
It's everybody's guess but the apathy won
Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion
Or will you settle for oblivion?

We are kill gods!

(We) We make this world worth saving
(Are) Are you prepared to believe?
(Kill) Kill everything that kills you
(Gods) Live long and die for me
Yeah

Rape crutch and stick in the middle
Of an evidence bag that'll never obey
All these years spent hiding all the bodies
I could never be sure, but I remember the graves

We are kill gods!

Can I feed you again?
Will I have to stay dumb?
You can feel and it begins

But I know inside this heart attack
I can see through your eyes
I'm terrified of everything
But it's no real surprise

Because the parasites are dancing closer
All this sacrilegion warns in posters
Can you handle it?

In the dark
Why I think I'm alone
I swept through my visions
I'm going too cold

Today is a tragedy
In the mouth of the mad
But that doesn't matter now
I've come home relaxed

I'm curled up in a ball and shaking
I'm hiding from the hell I'm making
I can't believe the chance I'm taking
Is there any other way?

I don't seem to care today
I mirror what I love with what I hate
Empty ways can cloud your eyes
I only know because I tried

So come with me, come with me
Let's meet our contestants
There's no better time to play the game

I don't want to give it away
Underneath the citadels
Buried deep with your guilt and regrets
Leading in the dark, everything is wonderful
I don't care, I don't want to forget

Why is it a crime? It's none of your business
I prefer to be in hell by myself
Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody who
Refuses to forgive when nothing was taken

No one else survives
I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes
Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

Hidden in the rubble
Everybody's got a story to tell
What do I need? Eliminate the possible
All that's left is a man in a cell

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe a decision is
The better way to go, the better way to be
I've got my demons, go get your own
Save another number, don't forget to hate me

No one else survives
I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes
Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still killed us all

No one else survives
I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes
Lost in here, I realize

The one that kills the least still kills us all

Album  .5: The Gray Chapter
Our friends are all hurting
From moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping
To fix all the defects and strengthen these Seminal ties

We go on together
For better or worse, our history is too real to hate
Now and forever
We stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fates

'Til we die
'Til we die

The start of the journey
Is every bit worth it, I can't let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing
We're never afraid and the consequence opens the door

I've never stopped trying
I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me
The piece that I represent compliments each and every one

'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

'Til we die
'Til we die

My last true confession
Will open your eyes, I've never known trust like the nine
Let it be spoken
Let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive

'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on

(We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite)

'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
'Til we die
'Til we die

'Til we die (we won't be forgotten, we'll never give in)
'Til we die (this war we've achieved has allowed us to win)
'Til we die (we'll never be broken, we won't be denied)
'Til we die (our war is the pressure, we need to unite)

Album  All Hope Is Gone
It appears that we have reached the Edge, that zenith where stimuli and comatose collide.
Forty years ago, The Man proclaimed the Age of the Gross to be upon us, and even though the
Man was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence,
That era has become very real.
We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure.
My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust.
Some have fought and died.
Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about
And will never understand.
I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is Not mankind.
Distrust in information.
Fundamentalism of opinion.
Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which does not matter.
Where is your glory now, people?
Where are your gods and politicians?
Where is your shame and salvation?
You Rage For No Reason Because You Have No Reason.

What have you ever fought for?
What have you ever bled for?
The face of the earth is scared with the walking dead.
The age of the gross is a living virus.
This is the future you have created.
This is the world you have set ablaze.
All your lies are coming true.
All Freedom Is Lost.
All Hope Is Gone.

The State of the Nation, violation
A broken promise is as good as a lie
The Hell is humongous, the Devil's among us
And we will burn 'cause we won't unite

What are we conceding for freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em?
I would rather fight than let another die
We're the problem, but we're also the solution

All hope is gone

If you want it, come and take it from me
If you think you can you still don't know me
Let me tell you man, I said it, I meant it
And I will always have the right to defend it

Fifty seconds a hundred murders
The Bill of Rights is a bill of sale
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails?

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone

The wretched are the wounded
The hungry starve to death
In a place where no one goes
The air itself is a final breath

So discontinue
The antiseptic care charade
As the cry of justice comes
A malignant fire fades

I am the reason your future suffers
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation
I am the remedy spit in my face

All your laws and rules are outdated
All your subjects are killing the kings
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way (we'll find a way)
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world (we'll end the world)
When all hope is gone

When all hope is gone
When all hope is gone
When all hope is gone

Contrite, commercial, arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fecker—mindless, like a child
For pity's sake—I've had all that I can take
We try—but in the end, we'll see
There are no more codes
Only who is shit and who's still free

I was gonna change the world
With honor and aggression
No one listened; no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

I don't want you anymore
I don't want you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore

Fingerprint of God; your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever; you'll never have to say, "Surrender"
Because you're so part of it

My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I can't follow

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

You'll never censor me; you'd better cherish me
My reason has a voice; freedom's gone, but we'll always have a choice
My present future tense, it doesn't make much sense
I'm coming after you—fuck you all; I'm the only point of view

Violence and dollar signs; another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds and give away the only cost
You can't delay the inevitable
Lost—don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground, but I won't care when I go down

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)

Child of burning time
Child of burning time

My only consolation is a lie
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter hasn't ended and it always looks like rain
I can't remember anything (anything)

Inside the absolution, we succumb
And appetites are bittersweet; I think I'm going numb
A chance to give up avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time is gone
He hasn't come back yet...

Before I tell my story, please consider who I am
I missed my window years ago; I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace, but in the end, they go away
My skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame

I cut my name into my heart
I'll tear it all apart
I beg you

Burn me away
I won't become your hero just to fight the life I save
Burn me away
I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

I burn away

My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over, I won't ever lose my rage

I cut my name into my soul
I guess I'll never know
I beg you

Burn me away
I won't become your hero just to fight the life I save
Burn me away
I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today
Burn me away
I won't become your hero just to fight the life I save
Burn me away
I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today

Sitting in the dark I can't forget
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again, I can't go back again

But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away I only got so far
The other me is dead. I hear his voice inside my head

We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I will never survive
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

You told me to love you and I did
Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
So when I got away, I only kept my scars
The other me is gone. Now I don't know where I belong

We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

Dead visions in your name
Dead fingers in my veins

Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

Oh, oh

Do you believe? Do you fade like a Dream?
Let me hear you breathe
Let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes.... Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

The blood and the body
Control the cut so it's seamless
Show me your heart
Show me the way to complete this

Tethered to a scene I treasure; can you help me?
I sever God; it's perfect, it's never really perfect
Now... I can finally be myself
'Cause I don't want to be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
(I don't want to be myself)

I cannot maintain
A semblance of normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain
Than try to fit in with you anymore

I'll throw it all away
Like everybody else
I can finally be myself
'Cause I don't want to be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
(I don't want to be myself)

That was all I got and now you got me
All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in history and not down in flames

Meningitis, I will survive this
Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
The time of The Nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one!

This is so typical, apocalyptical
Hanging on abysmal release, Jesus
I don't need this, don't wanna be this
Icon in the making, my hands are fucking shaking!

What if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care?

Remember, surrender, the time is now
Continue, we're in you and we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name, it doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field, it's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past and fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

What if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care?

America is a killing name, it doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field, it's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past and fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

Down...

We will burn your cities down
We will burn your cities down
We will burn your cities down

Feed the hungry, feed them shit, feed them bones and politics
You wanna revolutionize? Be specific and believe your eyes!
Start a war in another backyard and we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind, give me a bullet and I'll change your life

Remember, surrender, the time is now
Continue, we're in you and we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name, it doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field, it's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past and fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

Down...
Down...
We will burn your cities down!

I did my time and I want out
So effusive—fade—it doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo-sacrosanct perversion

Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done; it has begun
I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Oh, there are cracks in the road we laid
But when the temple fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had

Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness
But I'm missing something
I think we're done
I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage again

So if you love me let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there

Deliver me unto my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight

So save your breath I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough

I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go

Oh oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself

And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don't ever let me know

If you still care don't ever let me know

My guilt and my shame
Always sell me short, always feel the same
And my face and my soul
Always wear me thin, always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I'll pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on!

So let me get this straight: The only will is my own?
I do whatever I want and stay alone?
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it, or die!

Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur!

My life is undone and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my gods are untrue, I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life, were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive!

Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur!
Like breathing in sulfur!

Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur...
Stay, you don't always know where you stand, (You don't always know where you stand)
till you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels (There's something inside me that feels)
like breathing in sulfur!

Like breathing in sulfur!
Like breathing in sulfur!
Like breathing in sulfur!

Welcome out

Mother Nature is a coward (Mother Nature is a whore)
No more presence, no more power (I pray for death by the hour)
Cut another smile into me (Into me is all you are)
My artifice won't recognize me (You won't find me) anymore

Posttraumatic war machines
The pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes
It's all I can to feel

Let my weapons be your children
Let my armies be your damned
Try to suffer on in silence
Try to stop me if you can

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Someday, one day, we'll live our lives again

My ghosts have found their way back home
I have every right to kill my own (I have every right to kill my own)
I am something now that never could exist
My anguish conquers all; pay the price and watch me fall
My only key is broken—my broken key is only... Me

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Someday, one day, we'll live our lives again

You utter waste of tired flesh
It doesn't matter if you can't progress
Even now, they still create me
Give me your ignorance; irritate me

I am made of the same debris
You want it all, but you didn't want me
Hypocrite with no real use
I'm alive; what's your excuse?

We'll live our lives again

I learned my lessons, Ive conquered death
I go on and Im unashamed

Ill paint your bones to match my eyes
Theyre the darkest I have ever seen
Until Im lucid I cant be told
I know my voices, they tell me to believe

Another fucking accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I cant accept that I still dont find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away
Its everywhere, its everyone, its everyday

Are you ready for the time of your life?
Are you ready for the time of your life?

I beg your pardon, Im out of the way
A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over I smell the decay
Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same

In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy, Im feeling fine
The agony of cynicism beckons me

"Thou shalt not"

Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear.

Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence dominion
I only wanna believe in fuckin' anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything.

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear.

Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time.

We can run, but we are tired of runnin'
We're droppin' seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fuckin' everything
But we're alive and we're not accepting anything.

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Annihilation.

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more.

We have to save ourselves.
We have to save ourselves.

We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!

Oh, I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate.
Live forever? Well, I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create.

This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fuckin' anything
But my solace is, I can handle everything.

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Obliteration.

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better.

Step inside; see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside; see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your devil anymore

Under the words of men
Something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend?
Instantiates never even bother

You and I, wrong or right
Traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
You're not what you seem

Step inside; see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside; see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your devil

I'm not your devil anymore

Your station is abandoned
Fooled you, 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, deprivation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone

So step inside; see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside; see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside; see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your devil (Anymore)

So step inside, step inside
See the Devil in I, see the Devil in I

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside
If the pain goes on

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this; I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create

Now I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way; nothing is what it seems

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane

Money makes a man and that's a crime
If we all were rich we'd spend more time
With our daughters and sons, they're loosing their minds
We all feel hurt here's mine, here me now

Cause, no guns are allowed in here tonight
We're gonna have a free for all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts turn the music up loud

Let the music play, me don't want no more gun-play
When the bodies hit the ground, there's nothing let to say ay ay
Me don't want to see no more innocent blood shed
Me don't want to see no more youth dead
Come hear me now

Cause, no guns are allowed in here tonight
We're gonna have a free for all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts turn the music up loud

Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home
This is when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
one summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Crying and saying to leave him alone
But I'm not leaving his side
I know that somebody died, somebody's child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks them
They just cant wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shayne and Josh
and pour something out for the lives that they stole
416

Cause, no guns are allowed in here tonight
We're gonna have a free for all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts turn the music up loud

Money makes a man and that's a crime
Money makes a man and that's a crime
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight

Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather and what's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper who can open up a map and see between one and two

Time to get it before you let it get to you
Here he comes now. Stick to your guns and let him through

Everybody's coming from the winter vacation, taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes with Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes. I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station, gonna fight and tear it up in a hyper-nation for you

Now I see it I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you and it's not clear why you fade away

Looking for a ride to your secret location where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rocking and a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

It better work out. I hope it works out my way
'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city head takes a teenage riot to get me out of bed right now

You better look it, we're gonna shake it up to him
He acts the hero, we paint a zero on his hand

We know it's down. We know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is around it, everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather, you're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze

It's time to go 'round. A one man showdown, teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now and back on the road on the riot trail

Finger on the love, it's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You be makin' out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road, and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
Dirty boots are on, hi-de-ho

Don't you remember you told me you love me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby baby baby baby oh baby

Loneliness, is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again
What to say
To make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

Heard your name the other day, it's been a long, long time
Ancient history, some would say, another state of mind
You smell of memory felt-tipped electric child

She takes a plastic pill, she plays the weatherman
She screams "Religion kills more than it saves you, man"
She painted filigrees, she was the acid queen
She claims society is just a fever dream

Now you live in the trees and salty seas tripping out in the blue skies
You shut the door on everything too busy getting high
And me, just another dream theory lost inside your eyes

She's not in your history books, lost her mind and kept her looks
Down beneath the radar screen, she's lit up like gasoline
Been throught a million kicks looking for the one that sticks
Never would've known it then, I might not see her again

Top hats and tails for thrills, red lips and famous hands
Sidelong and glancing still in tiny dancer land

We kissed, time slipped, hard edged, tight lipped
See you some time, ask me if I care

The firefighters hose me down
I don't care, I'll burn out anyhow
It's for alarm, girl, nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me

You dosed my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain

Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate

The firefighters are so nice
I remember you so cold as ice
Now flames are licking at your feet
Sirens come to put me out of misery

You wave your torch into my eyes

Her light eyes were dancing
She is insane
Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer, saying "I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home"

My future is static
It's already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene
But I got a hunch
It's coming back to me

Where you fighting your battles
Are you on my side?

Moments I once adored
Why is all this in pieces
Can't you let it lie?

Leave love alone
Water under my skin
We are a long way from home
Water under

In every step and all your work you've made
I knew you'd take it back all along say the words I don't want to feel
In every step and all your work you've made
Leave it I can't bear sleeping alone

Leave love alone
Water under my skin
Looked for a long time
For me
I guess it's all a memory
I lost a bet, a bet

All I fear is
Dying
Alone alone

As I am getting no answer
The time to wake just draw closer
Lest all our nights would show closure

Closer and closer to you
Remember the night in the stars

Through the night it's never ending
Though the world is asleep in hollow
Memories lie in your wake
Careless motions in the moment
Play it off to the sound we all know
Blazing the night as we go

Closer and closer to you

Always questioning every single thing
Never giving up without a fight
Because for you, your resistance is a way of life

Bent but not broken, hanging on by a thread
Looked past by most, looked down on by all.
We don't need them, it's forever us against them all
Forever us against them all

GO!

A fire burns inside you, fueled by everything that
You've ever been through
Every battle you fight goes uphill
But nothing can ever break your iron will

She thinks, "Another day I'm left to drag my broken soul
Through the streets, into work and school, then back home"
Not a man in her life that makes her feel whole
Because it's the men in her life that filled her with those holes.
"What have I done to deserve this?"
To face a raising fist that screams, "You think I like this bitch?!"
Don't you worry my darling, mommy just tripped
She can feel her sanity starting to slip
So she dreams, if I could just go...

Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me
Help me

Entangled in a web of complete misery
Her cries are stifled by a fear of what he might do to the kids
"If i just stick it out this might end soon"
"This is all my fault,
If I had just done what he said I could have avoided this all"
And still she dreams, if I could just go...

Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me
Help me

Chewed up and spit out, lost and alone.
Your jobs been ripped from you and on deck, your home.
Can't feed yourself, let alone feed the kids.
American dreams have turned to your American greed.
Their fingers are crossed while they smile and promise.
The wrong side of broke while our gold lines their pockets.
On the priority list we place dead last,
and their foreclosed signs line our "greener grass."
Look me in my eyes you crooked fuck.
Not one more god damn lie.
Your time is up.
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down.

Watch the weight of it all come crashing down.
United, now the kings will lose their crown.

Now we're shit out of luck and they don't give a fuck.
No they don't give a fuck.

Now the masses awaken.
The embodiment of sacrifice.
History in the making.
Witness defining moments of our lives.

Their fingers are crossed while they smile and promise.
The wrong side of broke while our gold lines their pockets.
On the priority list we place dead last,

This is another life
Built upon the sand

You've hit bottom and you're still sinking
So small and you're still shrinking
What can you do
You've gone from alone to completely see through

Let's all watch while the hammer falls

They pushed me, they pushed me

Ya, well you say "fuck the world" we say "fuck you"

But you've been nowhere and you've seen nothing
It's your stupid stare, it tells me everything
If you can't beat them try harder because we're not going down
You better give back or get out

You're looking for more
You follow a whore
On fire for Christ but your life is lukewarm
Evil and foul to the lives you dismiss
And I hate the fact that I let myself be pushed to this

This is a place of acceptance
Not a place of repentance
So save your breathe
You homophobic shithead

One day you will pay your debt but until then
I'll fight to undo every word that you've said

And every time you lift your hand to cast your stone
I'll find you and shove it back down your throat

We are the ones, who stay awake,
while the world sleeps.
Because we still believe.
We are the ones, who will achieve,
what the world dreams.
Because we still believe.

You opened the gate,
and what came rushing out
is far too powerful for you to hold down.
If there's a better way, someone please tell me now,
but there's not, this is what

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake,
while the world sleeps.
Because we still believe.
We are the ones, who will achieve,
what the world dreams.
Because we still believe.

From here on out, I will live
deliberately!
I can't sit back, to watch the world die,
I must fight back!
I'll pay the price, there's more to this,
not just me!

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake,
while the world sleeps.
Because we still believe.
We are the ones, who will achieve,
what the world dreams.
Because we still believe.

Her name is amber
She has eyes like her mother
She's beautiful and bright the whole worlds in front of her
She has a smile that could end a war
Yet no one wants her and she has nothing to care for
Shes only 14 and she thinks
Why is the weight of the world crashing down on me
Cause as of late the sun doesn't seem to shine so bright
And the place where my heart once was has lost its fight

She's on her own
And as she's braves her storm
All alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone

You don't have to be alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

Her arms are locked in the devils chains
And her heart, broken and trapped in a steel cage.
She can't catch her breath as she chokes on the pain
So she brings her pain to the surface of her skin.

Your frozen agony burns you. Can't even begin to know
The nightmare that you've been through.
Only you can break the cycle that plagues you
There is a light you just have to see it through.

She's on her own
And as she's braves her storm
All alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
But braves her storm
You are not alone

From the soul of the unnamed
to the devastating depths of the heads and the hearts of the shamed,
with patience like the fury of a freight train,
I'll always have faith in the untamed.
I have faith in the untamed.
No room to think when digression is fought.
Progression of thought dies and goes right out the door.
It's hard to move on when tradition is the whore
that keeps your feet nailed to the frozen floor.
Now it weighs down your mind
and once again left you deaf, dumb, and blind,
but I have faith that one day
we'll have the strength to rip our every single page.
I have faith. You'll find no peace from this.
You'll still be empty.
It will never end.
This tradition is downfall.
It's hard to let go when you're still holding on.
You'll find no peace from this.
You'll still be empty.
You better believe we're breaking boundaries.
A routine for the uninspired,
for the hearts that lack any fire.
You put your thoughts in dying hands
while you wade through the quicksand.

I live in the valley by the sea
Lined with the scent of orange trees.
This is the place that's always loved me.
I wake where the sun never sleeps,
In-between the mountains and where the water and sky meet.

This is the place I was raised,
My family and my friends.
This is my everything.
This is the place I was saved,
My beginning and end,
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

And Just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there's no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

Just look at the view,
If this is wrong then I don't wanna be true.
If you're not here then I don't wanna be you.
Even if I tried I couldn't forget,
It only makes sense that my heart belongs where the sun sets.
And when I start to smell the salt from the sea,
I know I'm close,
I'm coming home.

And Just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there's no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

Orange County, this one's for you!

And Just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there's no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

I think about you all the time.
Down, down, never bring me down.
Down, down, never bring me down.

Our heros left to die.
We push our young ones to the side.
And hung bright minds out to dry.
In the downpour, we'll drown if we dont find some truth.
This is our nation without a roof.
The fire of this hopelessness ignites.
The fury of misfortune strikes.
Supreme isolation reigns -
The wolves are at the door we walk on common ground.
Its in our hearts to help those that have been shut out.
And if just one, we are all the tired and the poor.
So lift your lamp before we break down the door.
New colossus,
They fall on blind eyes and your teeming shores, they multiply. naked as the birth of a New day amazing grace please show your sick and hungry a new fate.
The wolves are at the door we walk on a common ground.
Its in our hearts to help those that have been shut out.
And if just one, we are all the tired and the poor.
So lift your lamp before we break down the door.
It is the obligation of those who have everything to help those who have nothing

Why, is everything so gray, is everything so strange
Is everything so thrown together by mistake?
Why, is everything contrite, is everything a plight
Is everything so insincere and out of sight?

Why, does everything seem wrong,
Does everything look drawn,
Does everything seem blasted like it don't belong?

I wanna make it a way, I wanna make it a waste
I wanna make it a gross misadventure
I wanna make you all!
I wanna make you all!
I wanna make you
Lie to me, lie to me

When, did everything go bad, did everything fall flat,
Did everything decay and lose itself so fast?
When, did everything succumb, did everything go numb,
Did everything lobotomize what it's become?

When, does everything come back,
Does everything relapse,
Does everything save face and find itself at last?

I wanna show you the way, I wanna show you the waste
I wanna show you the worst misadventure
I wanna show you all!
I wanna show you all!
I wanna show you how to
Die for me, die for me

I wanna give it a way, I wanna give it the waste
I wanna give it the worst misadventure
I wanna give it all!
I'm gonna give it all!
I'll never give up!
Lie to me, die for me

Now, everything's a lie, everything's your lie
Everything's a face inside another lie
Now, everything's a side, everything's one side
Everything depends on just which side you're on

I am a dominant gene, live as I die
Never say forever 'cause forever's a lie
I can see right through it so I can't ignore you
The story changes but the ending will bore you

I tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
They didn't listen so they threw you away
Now all you do is talk,
I don't wanna hear your bullshit

Is this what you want?

(This is where it begins)
(This is where it ends)
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation,
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all plenty alive
We know where you are and were coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face

Thirty thirty-one fifty remembers
Thirty thirty-one fifty hates

In my own peculiar way I feel mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where but I still don't know the when

You wanna live in a one sided world
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now with the grand facade
I don't want to be an angel
I just want to be God

They called us a dead generation,
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all plenty alive

(Oh)
I am a fucking machine fueled by the past
Memory's a memory until it's a fact
I can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
But I got too many grudges to hold

Saw a lot of people die in the end
I never want to walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don't want to have it all,
I just want to have enough

(This is where it begins)

I reach into the dark, I tear this other me apart
How many years ago, how many deaths I can't let go?
My flesh is temporary, my God, extraordinary!

You can't kill my mind!

A man delivered, can never make his way in darkness
I know tonight will end,
But I won't give this life away again

Sifting through this same debris, oh my father, call to me
This smoke is in my blood, this home is just no good
Save me from my bitterness, give me up, I did my best
Shock this system full of shit, lock this fucker lost in it!

You can't kill my mind!

A man delivered, can never make his way in darkness
I know tonight will end,
But I won't give this life away
I won't give this life away again!

A man surrendered, can never find his own forgiveness
I know my life will end,
But I won't give tonight away
I won't give tonight away again

Woah-yeah!

This fluid feels like pain
This ruin feels like rain
I reach into the past
My future's fading fast

Can you take away every single day
That we have given to another false prophet?
Can you give us all a reason not to fall
Before you take away another broken promise?

Show your pretty face
Hide the bitter taste
You're still the rapist of an entire nation
You wanna be the man?
You gotta be a man
But you are nothing but a sad insinuation

How can we ever live this down?
How can we ever live this down?

Keep your fingers crossed, the truth is at a loss
Big decision for an ordinary coward
The only problem is your fuckin' rhetoric
We're more in danger than before you took power

Now it's just a game
God, you'll never change
You'd sell us out if you could only find a buyer
You don't give a shit
As long as idiots are in your corner, you could set us all on fire

How can we ever live this down?

You never wanted to be
They only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free?
What the hell is free about it?

Now we've reached the end, just get it over with
But this is building to an adamant conclusion
Come whatever may, there's gonna be a day
When we have figured out a plausible solution

Everything you've done is killing everyone
A little smile on a homicidal bastard
You wanna be the man?
You better have a plan
Another failure is a guaranteed disaster

How can we ever live this down?

This one came from looking, this one opened twice
These two seemed smooth as silk, flush against my eyes
This one needed stitches, and this one came from rings
This one isn't even there, but I feel it more because you don't care

Yeah, cut right into me
Yeah, because I am made of scars
Yes, I am made of scars

This one had it coming, this one found a vein
This one was an accident, but never gave me pain
This one was my father's, and this one you can't see
This one had me scared to death
But I guess I should be glad I'm not dead

Yeah, cut right into me
Yeah, because I am made of scars
Yes, I am made of scars

Oh, I swear that I will find a way
Everything you are's inside me

This one was the first one
This one had a vice
This one, here, I like to rub on dark and stormy nights
This one was the last one

Freedom's just a word today, freedom's just a word
When someone takes your word away, it's seldom ever heard
So take a sentence full of things you're not supposed to say
Carry on, but don't write 'em down, or you'll be gone

Love is just a song today, love is just a song
When someone takes the song away, you seldom sing along
So take those lyrics serious and sing your life away
Carry on, but don't write 'em down, or they'll be gone

All we ever do is talk; we like to ride, but we never walk
We make it so damn easy, we get bored
Why can't anybody see, what's good for you is good for me?
I can't take your silly world
I can't take your silly world no more

Peace is just two fingers now, peace was just a face
When someone put it on a shirt, you knew to count the days
So take those fingers, tape 'em up, and shove 'em up your ass
And carry on, but don't try it now, 'cause peace is gone

All we ever do is talk; we like to ride, but we never walk

I think it's gonna be today
Everybody came, but it's just not the same
Why did it have to be today?

Now my chest is tight
No, I am not all right
It doesn't have to be this way
Why does it have to be this way?

I don't know what's wrong,
It's like I'm too far gone
It doesn't matter anyway
Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts
And I can never live this way

Freedom in a cage, no sun and too much rage
I don't know how much I can take
Push it down inside, but it know just where I hide
I know that "normal" is hard to fake
Bleeding into life, it's like a thousand knives
Are slowly turning me to this
Why does it have to be like this?

I don't know what's wrong,

I'm looking at you through the glass.
Don't know how much time has passed.
Oh God it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass.
Don't know how much time has passed.
All I know is that it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

How do you feel? That is the question.
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer.
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes.
You can't expect a bit of hope.
So while you're outside looking in
Describing what you see,
Remember what you're staring at is me.

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass.
Don't know how much time has passed.
All I know is that it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,

How much is real? So much to question.
An epidemic of the mannequins contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart,
But never did right from the start.
Just listen to the noises.
(Null and void instead of voices).
Before you tell yourself it's just a different scene,
Remember it's just different from what you've seen.

Reveal to me this ugly thing,
I'm rusted metal by your head
It's gotten out of hand again,
Nobody sees it, but I can

You thought of everything, I bet,
But did you think that I might die?
I haven't really smiled in
I don't know know how long, you know
Something's gonna give again,
Something's gonna give again

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be you god,
But then I don't even think I want the job anymore

Say something, anything to me
I do believe, but I have doubts
So many reasons to hold on,
Conflicting interest isn't it

I guess I'm better off in the end,
'Cause you were always there to blame
I haven't felt so bad in
I don't know how long, you know
I can't get away again,
I can't get away again

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be your god,
But then I don't even think I want the job, you see

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be your god,
But then I don't even think I want the job anymore

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?
All I ever did was try,
But the story ends,
So I guess I'll have to die

Where am I supposed to go now?

Go ahead and go away
Go ahead and go away
Go ahead and go away
Go ahead and go away

Go away

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?
All I ever did was try,
But the story ends,
So I guess I'll have to die

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?
What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?

How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to live?

I don't know how else to put this.
It's taken me so long to do this.
I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight.

My muscles feel like a melee,
My body's curled in a U-shape.
I put on my best, but I'm still afraid.

Propped up by lies and promises.
Saving my place as life forgets.
Maybe it's time I saw the world.

I'm only here for a while.
And patience is not my style,
And I'm so tired that I got to go.

What am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
Did you really think I wouldn't see this through?

Tell me I should stick around for you.
Tell me I can have it all.
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go.

I get to go home in one week.
But I'm leaving home in three weeks.
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry.

I'm following suit and directions.
I crawl up inside for protection.
I'm told what to do and I don't know why.

I'm over existing in limbo.
I'm over the myths and placebos.
I don't really mind if I just fade away.

I'm ready to live with my family.
I'm ready to die in obscurity
'Cause I'm so tired that I got to go.

Where am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
You still don't think I'm gonna see this through?

Tell me I'm a part of history.
Tell me I can have it all.
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go.

I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go

The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot
I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you

No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon, you can't have mine

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero

The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your primadonnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react, it's as simple as that
It's better just to settle than face the facts

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero

One thing that I can't stand is when the minutes fight the second hand
I'll waste a lifetime's worth just to cling to one more day

No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
"Man" is a four-letter word, it's really absurd
The hate isn't fake, it's just inferred

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I'm not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero

Stones to throw at my Creator

But once I hold on
I won't let go till it bleeds

Wish I was too dead to care?
If indeed, I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason, my flaws are open season
For this I gave up trying, one good turn deserves my dying

A zombie hides my face
Shell, forgotten with its memories
Diaries left with cryptic entries

And you don't need to bother

Well where does it say
All the love that we made must disappear?
And who made the rule
That the one who is cruel won't cry the tears?

Well we woke up unsatisfied,
Got out of bed and said goodbye
But don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees
And prayed to the lord above

Don't leave me now, baby realize
You can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Who pays the cost
If the love that is lost goes unredeemed?
And why should I care
If this cross that I bear is destiny?

My heart was pure, my love was strong
Forgive me if I've done you wrong
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees
And prayed to the lord above, oh-whoa

Don't leave me now, baby realize
You can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Where does it say
All the love that we made must disappear?
Who made the rule
That the one who is cruel won't cry the tears?

Well, now I know how cruel thou art
Have mercy baby on my heart
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees
And prayed to the lord above, oh-whoa

Don't leave me now, baby realize
You can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here

The wind is blowing beer cans
Down a cold, deserted street
I feel as empty as those beer cans
Rolling past my feet

I can hear Chicago blues
From an out of tune guitar
And a "1939" neon sign
Buzzing above the bar

I'm at an intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love

Left me on the corner of Lust and Love
She left me on the corner of Lust and Love

I got an old tattoo dedicated to you
Covered up with thorns
But the heart bleeds through and your name does, too
Forever on my arm

Each night I go walking
Through the darkness all alone
But I never get off that dirty old street
No matter how far I roam

Intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love

Left me on the corner of Lust and Love
She left me on the corner of Lust and Love

Underneath the street lights
I strain my eyes to see
The silhouette's reflection
Of a long black Mercury

Shadows on the pavement
From the corners of my eye
Fool me into thinking
My baby's passing by

Intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
You're the only one I've been thinking of
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love...

She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love

Yeah!
Oh!
Uh!

Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love

Mmm...

Sitting by myself, looking out a broken window
And out on the street crowds of people passing by
But how are they to know I'm feeling so alone
I feel like I could break down and cry

Now I know how broken hearts must feel

But my heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it's true
The flames keep on burning, burning so high
Never gonna die -- why?

Sitting all alone, feeling sorry for myself
I catch my reflection and I see the kind of fool I've been
But how was I to know I have to let you go?
The only way to make it alright

Now you've lit the flame again

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it's true
The flame keeps on burning, burning so high
It's never gonna die -- why?

Sometimes I think I pass you by
But it's just love blinding my eyes

Sitting all alone, feeling sorry for myself
I catch my reflection and I see the kind of fool I've been
But how was I to know I had to let you go?
The only way to make it alright

Now you've lit the flame again!

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it's true
The flame keeps burning, burning so high
Never gonna die -- no-oh-oh!

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it's true
The flame keeps burning, burning so high
Never gonna die -- why?

I know a place
Where the wounded go
For cold souls unaware
With no self control
I know a place
Where the broken and wounded go

You just sit back and listen
And just do what you're told
Never knowing how things
Could have been as you grow old
This is your time and it's wearing thin
Don't let this happen again and again

You can catch me in a storm
Of thoughts and prayers
Sleep away your American nightmare

I won't lie with you in your grave
Sleep away your American nightmare
Sleep, it. Sleep it away,
Your American nightmare

You just sit back and listen
And just do what you're told
Never knowing how things
Could have been as you grow old
This is your time and its wearing thin
Don't let this happen again and again

I may be wounded
I don't need to be saved
And though I'm wounded
I don't need to be saved

I won't lie, I won't lie,
With you in your grave

So put your fist in the air
To the sound of the new beat

Storming through the party like my name is El Niño
When I'm a hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Crashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing "act your age"

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Because you don't
Know us at all we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small
Heavy metal and mullets is how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other peoples expenses
Cutting people down is just a minor offense and
Its none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Don't count on me, to let you know when
Don't count on me, I'll do it again
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missin'
Don't count on me, cause I'm not listenin'

Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed and I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kumuppin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
Then if the egg don't stain you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion
(Abortion, abortion, abortion)

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down
(Waste my time with them)
Causality of society
(Waste my time again)
Victim of your conformity and back down

The faster we're falling
We're stopping and stalling
We're running in circles again
Just as things were looking up
You said it wasn't good enough
But still we're trying one more time

Maybe we're just trying too hard
When really it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head instead of going under
'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head instead of going under
Instead of going under

Seems like each time
I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bending over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain
But when you're driving me insane
Well, then I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just trying too hard
When really it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head instead of going under
'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head instead of going under
Instead of going under
Instead of going under

I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head instead of going under
'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head instead of going under
Instead of going under
Instead of going under again
Instead of going under
Instead of going under again
Instead of going under again

This is not up to you
The fact of the matter is

How can we fake this anymore (anymore)
We turn our backs away and choose to just ignore (Choose to just ignore)

It makes me feel some innocence
It takes away a part of me
That I won't let go of

When we all fall down, it won't be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
Will it take

Nothing could ever be this real (be this real)
A life unsatisfied that I could never feel (I could never feel)
(Some say) This future's not so bright
Some can't make the sacrifice
It's much more than just black and white
And I won't follow

When we all fall down it won't be too late

Why is there no reason we can't change

I tried to be perfect,
But nothing was worth it,
I don't believe it makes me real.
I thought it'd be easy,
But no one believes me,
I meant all the things I said.

If you believe it's in my soul,
I'd say all the words that I know,
Just to see if it would show,
That I'm trying to let you know,
That I'm better off on my own.

This place is so empty,
My thoughts are so tempting,
I don't know how it got so bad.
Sometimes it's so crazy,
that nothing could save me,
But it's the only thing that I have.

If you believe it's in my soul,
I'd say all the words that I know,
Just to see if it would show,

I'm sure they never knew enough
I know the pressures won't go away
It's too late

Find out we're different somehow
It's too late to even have faith
Don't think things will ever change
You must be dreaming

Think before you make up your mind
You don't seem to realize
I can do this on my own
And if I fall I'll take it all
It's so easy after all

Believe me 'cause now's the time to try
Don't wait, the chance will pass you by
Time's up to figure it out
You can't say it's too late

You've played the victim for so long now in this game.
What I thought was true
Is made of fiction and I'm following the same.
But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
I'm not sure where I should begin.
I'm falling, I'm falling...

Now I'm in
Over my head, with something I said
Completely misread I'm better off dead.
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me.

It's none of my concern.
Why look to me 'cause I don't believe in fame.
I guess you never heard.
I've met our makers they don't even know your name.
But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
I'd say my time has served me well.
I'm falling, I'm falling...

Now I'm in
Over my head, with something I said
Completely misread I'm better off dead.
And now I can see, how fake you can be

This came long before,
Those who suffer more
I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare.
What's with my disgrace
I lost the human race
No one plans for it to blow up in their face!

Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces?
Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces?

Now I'm in
Over my head, with something I said
Completely misread I'm better off dead.
And now I can see, how fake you can be

Over my head, better off dead.

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead, a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me, what would you say
I'd say its time too late

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance and understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding
How far will we take this
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me, what would you say
I'd say its time too late

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless
Tell me
So

What have we done
We're in a war that can't be won
This can't be real

Guess I don't understand, I need help in many ways

God's got a plan for me
Well I'm gonna tell you one thing
I don't got the patience, or the time
What can I say?
I'm no angel
I'm not forsaken,
But I can bleed

Tear me open, I believe
God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive
What it's meant to be and
"Bloody Murder" we will scream

Well I guess it's time for me
Tell me what I'm left to believe in?
Cause I don't know the concept
Of the pain

I don't want the faith
I'll just lose it
I can prove it
Watch me bleed

Tear me open, I believe
God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive
What it's meant to be and
"Bloody Murder" we will scream
God will send you all to tear me open!

'Cause I'm
Not giving up
No self control
Suffocating to the bone
I'm my worst enemy
Who can't be saved
I'm just his disgrace

Tear me open, I believe
God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive
What it's meant to be and
"Bloody Murder" we will scream
God will send you all to tear me open!

These days are strange it's true.
There's not a thing that I would change,
no mistakes that I'd undo.

I don't want this moment
To ever end
Where everything's nothing
Without you
I wait here forever just to
To see you smile
Cause it's true
I am nothing without you

Through it all
I made my mistakes
I'll stumble and fall
But I mean these words

I want you to know
With everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I'll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show
That I won't let go

Thoughts read unspoken
Forever and now
And pieces of memories
Fall to the ground
I know what I didn't have so
I won't let this go
Cause it's true
I am nothing without you

All the streets
Where I walked alone
With nowhere to go
Have come to an end

I want you to know
With everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I'll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show
That I won't let go

In front of your eyes
It falls from the skies
When you don't know what you're looking to find
In front of your eyes
It falls from the skies
When you just never know what you will find
What you will find
What you will find
What you will find
What you will find

I don't want this moment
To ever end
Where everything's nothing
Without you

I want you to know
With everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I'll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show
That I won't let go

I want you to know
With everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I'll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show

Take what you want
I chase what I need
Your kiss makes me weak
I'm lost when you leave

(when you leave)

You take all I have to give
I'm gonna break if I can't feel your lips
I need you desperately
I wish you'd tell me what to do
I'll be anything you want me to
I need you desperately

I'm caught up in the chase
When the door shuts I feel as though you
Never loved me, never loved me
Turn around and run my way
I'm tearing apart, tearing apart

Oh come back to me
I need your love now
Oh come back to me
I need your love now

(need your love)

I walk down the lonely street
Your face in everything I see
I'm begging you, begging you please
I'll never find another man
Who can take ahold of me like you can
I'm down on my knees begging you please

I'm caught up in the chase
When the door shuts I feel as though you
Never loved me, never loved me
Turn around and run my way
I'm tearing apart, tearing apart

Oh come back to me
I need your love now
Oh come back to me

Haue!
Guck da mal nicht so hin da -
Guck mal, wie er da guckt
Der Kokelfritze mit Opelmütze
will wohl 'nen Pferdekuss

Der guckt nach mehr von uns
Dieser Penner will aufmucken
Jetzt guckt er wieder her
Der Oschi hat doch Mauljucken

Mach dich mal grade da drüben da
Oder was ist hier, Alter!?
Willst du 'nen Zahn verlieren -
Gleich gibt das Fratzengeballer

Und dann noch was in die Eier -
Hol dich mal lieber fruchtig
Halt mal die Backen, du Knaller!
Sonst wird das hier noch lustig

Was willst du Pfosten da
also - du König Drosselbart
Seemann, mach die Socken klar
Und ich brech' dir die Flossen ab

Supershirt, Doppelschlag
Volle power Krawalle
Da muss nun echt keiner drängeln
- Denn es gibt Haue für alle

Haue

Was willst du Pavian?
Was hast du grad' gesagt?
Sag das noch mal,
Und du brauchst'n Termin beim Nasenarzt

Ich putz dir den Zahnbelag
Mit der Faust von der Kauleiste
Du Blaseblag kriegst heute Zähne als Hauptspeise

Ich reiß dir den Kopf ab
Und scheiß dir in'n Hals
(Gleich knallt's!)
Du mich gegen mich,
ist wie Alf gegen Hulk

Ich hau so lange zu,
da geht die Keule in'n Arsch!
Dir halben Hahn beiß' ich ne Beule in'n Bart

Haue

sie ist leer,

sie will mehr,
sie ist kalt,
sie ist laut,
sie ist hungrig
und frisst dich auf
du kannst die Nacht nicht bezwing,
aber du kannst dich verbünden
du musst denken wie sie
aussehn wie sie um in ihr zu verschwinden.

Refrain:
Du siehst die Lichter der Stadt
Du siehst die Lichter der Stadt
unten am Hafen und du willst nie mehr nach Haus
du blickst in die nacht durch verspiegelte Straßen,
jetzt bist du raus
du siehst die Lichter der Stadt unten am Hafen,
und du willst nie mehr nach Haus
Und du blickst in die Nacht durch verspiegelte Straßen,
und ziehst die Lederjacke nie wieder aus.

Sie beschützt dich,
egal was passiert
vor bösen blicken oder wenn du frierst,
sie wird zur zweiten Haut,
sie steht sich an,
ihr seit gleich gebaut,
sie passt sich an,
sie passt auf dich auf,
du gibst auf sie acht
ihr seht gut aus taucht in die Nacht,
du fällst nicht mehr auf doch wirst beachtet,
weil du ein Teil der Nacht bist,du in der Jacke.

Sie ist die Königin im Kiez,
die Pöblerin in weiß,
sie ist die Schöne und das Biest
böse und heiß
Ihr Mädchengang ist fies, aber du bist verliebt
wenn du siehst, wie sie ihre Töle anschreit.
Sie klaut und sie schnorrt,
aber du bist ihr verfallen.
Wenn sie ihr Bier mit den Zähnen aufmacht,
ist sie die Schönste von allen.

Du kannst ihr zusehen, kannst ihr nah sein;
du kannst hören wie sie spricht.
Du kannst auf sie zugehen oder ihr nachweinen,
aber haben kannst du sie nicht.
haben kannst du sie nicht.
kannst du sie nicht.
aber haben kannst du sie nicht.

Sie ist der Schrecken der Straße,
sie lügt wie gedruckt,
sie kriegt Sechsen in Mathe
und prügelt im Bus.
Dir gefriert das Blut, wenn du sie triffst,
ihr Herz aus Gold ist geklaut bei Brijou Brigitte
Du wärst gerne mit ihr alleine,
sie bricht dir dein Herz
und sie bricht dir die Beine,
doch das ist es dir wert.

Du kannst ihr zusehen, kannst ihr nah sein;
du kannst hören wie sie spricht.
Du kannst auf sie zugehen oder ihr nachweinen,
aber haben kannst du sie nicht.

Sie ist kreuzgefährlich, sie ist hundsgemein
Schau ihr zulange hinterher und sie haut dir Eine rein.

Du kannst ihr zusehen, kannst ihr nah sein;
du kannst hören wie sie spricht.
Du kannst auf sie zugehen oder ihr nachweinen,

You can be all you desire
An honest man - a vicious liar
Seek out the Light or seek the Dark

You can honor or desecrate
Sympathize or manipulate
Carved in your flesh - embrace the Mark

Enslaved and hypnotized -
Chained to artificial lives
You are the Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine

Be a saint for those in need
Or spin them webs of lust and greed.
Yeah, you've restored my dying faith

With a Kiss of Death - a last farewell
Hand in hand, through the Gates of Hell
You'll pay the price for the choice you make

I see your demons rise -
Deep within your burning eyes
You are the Bastards of the Machine

Screaming at the walls around me -
Broken and alone
Fighting with my inner demons is all I've ever known

All I am - I give to you
All my dreams and nightmares, too

Disconnected life of anguish -
The mirror fades to black
Feels like I'm sinking deep into illusion.
No one's staring back

Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...

Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

Just another faceless shadow - I'm desensitized
And I don't feel the pain, am I insane?
My nightmare's realized

Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...

Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

All I have - I give to you
All my dreams, my nightmares, too

Wretched promenade - watch the freak parade
Celebrate the suffering and affliction

Laugh at tragedy - worship sin with me
Let us share in selfish addiction

Spitting on the shrine - drink the poison wine
Leave a life in ruins - tattered and torn

Completely interfaced to a God without a Face
In his image of darkness... I'm reborn

Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

Tap the vein - inject my brain
And let the poison flow
Torn apart - you're ripping out my heart
It's painless, let it go

Hit the switch - you son of a bitch
I'm devoured, broke in two
You take control and resurrect my soul
Becoming something new...

What's done is done - I'm dead inside
I'm what you've all become - mindless and mesmerized

Dehumanized
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize - I'm Dehumanized
Oh, and Victimized
You can't break me,
You unmake me - Dehumanized

Ripped to shreds - the venom spreads
Release the system plague
Shed your skin - electrified within
Complete the final stage

I will break my shell and unleash Hell
There's nothing you can do
Just a cut above - this sacred New Blood
Becoming something new...

What's done is done - I'm dead inside

Don't you realize - I'm Dehumanized

You can't break me,
You unmake me - Dehumanized

Is this life worth the question why?
Or is this life just a lie?
'Cause my eyes are cold and numb,
And I don't know what the hell I've become...

Striking with Spears of Hate,
At the heart where evil reigns
Holding the line from the charge

Gather around this deadly ground,
Come watch the War God bleed.

Slowly they fall, as we watch

Ripping death from sin's unholy womb
The riders on the storm, cursed the day they're born

Strike them down - strike with power
Kill them all from shore to shore

Stench of burning flesh covers the land
Rising from the screams - a godless war machine

I believe... Nothing ever comes to light
Chasing shadows in the night
In a starless sky
And I wonder why

I believe... We will never find a way
That darkness lights the day
We never question why,
Still I wonder: why?

I close my eyes lost in a memory
Just like a candle in the wind
What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly
Far away, somehow, someday you will understand
I hope you'll understand... someday

Silent pictures speak like ghosts in the machine
Haunting my reflection in the frame
Chasing down the hopeful child inside of me
Where'd it all go wrong and who's to blame

We pass the time away
With empty lives, the laughter dies

Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way?
What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away

Thinking only of myself, I forged ahead
No regrets, no apologies
Bitter tears reward the life that I have led
A world of lies brings me to my knees

I took the road with every twist and every turn
The words of wisdom is the lesson never learned
Lose your fear and free your soul or
The mysteries of life you'll truly never know
You'll truly never know

Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way?
What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away
Just gave away

I close my eyes, lost in that memory
Like a candle in the wind
What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly far away
I hope you'll understand one day

We pass the time away
With empty lives, the laughter dies
And the colors fade, fade away
Oh daylight fades away
Oh no no no!

Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way?
What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away

What went wrong?
Where have all our heroes gone?
Trade our future for a song,
We gave it all away...

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

The cold insincerity of steel machines
Have consumed our euphoria
Transforming us into muted dreams
Dreaming of the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack

Books illustrate what we already know
Candles cry towards the sky
Racing your flags along polluted coast
Dreaming of the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack

Attack!

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

What's the philosophy of displaced minds
The bombing of all homes and villages?
Truth is the only sword bleeding minds
Bleeding till the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack!

Attack all the homes and villages
Attack all the schools and hospitals
You attack all the rapes and pillages
We shall attack!

Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering, when savior comes, is he gonna be saved
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back

They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth
He's never going home

Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering, when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back

They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go

While you are talking all detached, so tell us

I've been walking through your streets
Where all your money's earned
Where all your buildings crying
And clueless neckties working
Revolving fake lawn houses
Housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV

Overbearing advertising
God of consumerism
And all your crooked pictures looking good
Mirrorism
Filtering information for the public eye
Designed for profiteering
Your neighbor, what a guy

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has borne
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Modern globalization
Coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations
With a blinded flag

Manufacturing consent
Is the name of the game
The bottom line is money
Nobody gives a fuck!
Four thousand hungry children leave us per hour from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs
Creating death showers

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has borne
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Why must we kill our own kind?

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Every time you drop the boom!

Fish that don't drown
Life in a bubble jungle
I wouldn't frown
Not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground
But I was in there for you
Now leaving town
Life in a bubble jungle

Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling
Appeasing
The power struggle

We're left with no arms
Right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms
Right in the power struggle

Wearing the crown
Life in a bubble jungle
Chasing a clown
Not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground
But I was waiting for you
Now we have found
Life in a bubble jungle

Life is but a dream
Drifting on a stream, a stream
Consciously it seems
All of what remains

Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame
Love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

I am just a man
Fighting other men
For land, for land
While I turn to sand
In spite of the pain

Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame, love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand

I need, I feel, a love,
You love to love the fear,
I never want to be alone,
I've forgotten to, The road keeps moving clouds,
The clouds become unreal,
I guess I'll always be at home,
Do you want me to try,
Directing your night,

An exit lights the sky,
The sky becomes complete,
Traveling hearts divide the throne,
I've forgotten to,

Friction, lines, bumps,
The highway song complete,
The signs are all turning right,
Do you want me to try,
Directing your night,
Want me to try,
Directing your light,

The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
Our days are never coming back,
The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
Our days are never ever coming back.

Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back.

Wooden farts, they're on the go,

When the present can't be sealed,

For the mighty conquered meal.

I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

But I hear it inside my head all day
Then I realize I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe your feelings don't show

Seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago if that's the way it seems to go
We draw us apart to get to something real, it feels

Am Anfang bin ich noch zusammmengezuckt
obwohl ickn fahrschein hatte, wenn die kamen in zug
und die tür schloss mit dem tut tut tut
kurze pause "die fahrausweise bitte" und jut

gezückt und gezeigt mit soner art angstrespekt
vor diesen zivilkontrollen diesem ganzen dreck
sie haben immer wieder mal einen aus der bahn rausgezogen
und stolz auf ihre provision, pro person aufgezogen

die dürfen dich nicht anfassen, die dürfen höchstens glotzen
musst aufs recht bestehen und dem kontrollwahn trotzen
zöger alles so lange wie möglich hinaus
kram in allen deinen taschen wenn möglich freak aus

viele menschen sind schüchtern ham angst vor der scham
vor der bloßstellung vom schwarzfahrn in der bahn
glaubt mir keiner mag zivilkontrollen, springt an die wand
aber jeder zweite ist schwarzfahrersympathisant

man sagt det wäre keine art det
wäre falsch weil nicht bezahlt det
wär n aufruf zu ner straftat
"ick will das ihr alle schwarzfahrt!"

Südwest Inkasso und Haas & Kollegen
werden mir meinen schwarzfahrspaß nie vergeben
ich zahl nix ich bin angefixt
schwarzfahrer bildet banden und entwickelt tricks

wat? freiheit beim zug fahrn mit freiheitsentzug zahln
ich bewahr mir den mut benutz bus s- und u-bahn
wir fordern die freie mobilität für alle
und entschärfen bis dahin jede schwarzfahrfalle

2 €uro 10 cent nur in eine richtung
nur für einen fahrschein ihr provoziert mich
und alle, alle andern, nur für extra einnahmen
ihr seid jetzt reich genug lasst uns alle endlich frei fahrn

praktiziert

seid stolz auf die
diensterschleichungsleistung

na dann scheißt drauf seis drum

Will they remember my name when I'm gone?
When they know what I did was so fucking wrong?
Put the steel to my wrist - lost the breath in my chest,
just to forget all the wrongs I had left.
I took the exit, left my friends in the gutter;
left my life right behind me - left myself, left it all,
left myself, left it all,
not a falter not a stutter, not a note and now?
There's nothing at all.

Are you at all haunted by memories past?
Are you ready to make this one breath your last?
Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave,
or are you just hoping that someone will grieve?

And now we roll on... I'm gone now,
I don't remember much, I just know that I would have been better off
if i had stayed, spoken to a friend,
let my heart keep on beating and not given it all up for the grave.
There's no one there on the other side,
there's nothing more than what I had.
There's no ghost left to haunt you, so you know I'm still here,
just the end of my life nothing left here at all.
There's no memories here, just the regrets of the dead.
Please don't follow my footsteps- cherish all you have left.

I'm not searching for forever,
I've got my eyes opened wide,
I've been searching under rubble from the past,
just looking for a reason to make your life last.
No need to look skyward for you to find hope,
no need for redemption to be saved from the rope,

Fuck No!

I'm not searching the sky for a reason to live
'cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give.
So let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears,
let me give you my life, let me give you my fears.

Just so you can hold on and sing while I do, sing these words out so loud,
like I sing them for you.
This is your open letter, something to remember,
we can still keep on fighting even though life is not forever.

I held death's hand this evening

Can't keep my heart from beating
Can't keep my throat from screaming
There has to be another way for me to keep on living

I held death's hand this evening
Closed my eyes now I'm dreaming
I promise I won't leave here
Don't let me die I'm fucking screaming

'Cause I've got more life left to live (got some promises to keep)
To all the hearts that carried me (up from the ocean deep)
I've had to do some searching to understand our reasons
For every selfish feeling (I held death's hand this evening)

Now my lungs are failing
And my heart is fading
My mind is taking me
So far away I'm dreaming
For every selfish reason
I kept the bottles rolling
I poured my heart out
To stop you from leaving

I held death's hand this evening
Closed my eyes now I'm dreaming
I promise I won't leave here
Don't let me die I'm fucking screaming

So young, heartbroken, daydreaming, lost focus
Weaker than you've ever been
Counting on a fading dream
The ocean gleaming emerald green
The saddest thing you've ever seen
Your feet stuck in the sinking sand
Your mind is reeling, shaky hands
Tears are streaming, sorrow calls
With no one there to break your fall

I'm lost and fading, life ain't great
My heart is breaking and life won't wait
There's no one there, no one around
There's not a soul and not a sound

So fucking young, heartbroken, daydreaming, lost focus
A weary soul, no truth to find
They were so lost where was your goodbye?
Your feet stuck in the sinking sand
Your mind is reeling, shaky hands
Tears are streaming, sorrow calls
With no one there to break your fall

I'm lost and fading, life ain't great
My heart is breaking and life won't wait
There's no one there, no one around
There's not a soul and not a sound

You've searched your soul for far too long
Your friend was lost, you carry on
You bear the burden of sorrow's past
But you were built, you were built to fucking last
You were built to last
I'm fading fast, out in the cold unknown
All sorrow here, so far from home
So far from home

I'm lost and fading, life ain't great
My heart is breaking and life won't wait
There's no one there, no one around
There's not a soul and not a sound
No one around and not a sound

We struggle to our feet
We all yearn to be free
We fight and we're weak
We all come out and grieve

This goddamn life is our disease
But we can't always fucking win
We can always turn the tide
We can all stand up and sing 'never alone'

We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
This place is now what we call home

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Listen, always...
We'll be drowning in our grave
Are we can't stand for ourselves
We have to stay afloat
(We struggle to breathe)

With the word that we try to believe
When I lost my home and find my way home
We can always turn the tide
And we get lost and not be blind, never alone

We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
(This place is not away from home)
We are never, ever alone

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore
We'll turn the tide, we'll calm the storm
We are ready for war
We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

(Hello? Are you there? Listening? I'm just trying to get in touch man. I've been so fucking, so fucking down lately. Like, I don't know what's happening. I'm just so tired all the time. Trying to sleep. I just, I just lay there quiet. Can't speak cause everyone around me is passed out. My fucking mind's raging. Uh, hello? I don't even know why I called. I think it, I think it might be time for me to leave. Just call it quits. I'm sick of this. It's the same fucking day, every day. I think I sleep, I can't be sure though. It's all the same now. Drink, drink, drink again. I'm tired man. I think it, you don't want to hear this. I'm a mess. I'm sorry man. I just don't know who to turn to. No one really hears me, you know? I speak, at least I think I speak, but no one hears me. I've said enough. Hello? Hello? I shouldn't have called.)

I've been searching for an exit, but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment wishing I was dead
For a few minutes get me away from here
For a few minutes wipe away my tears
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink

It's like there's cancer in my blood
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone

I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment wishing this would end
I can't take another step, I cannot live inside my mind
I can't face another day, I am so fucking tired
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink

It's like there's cancer in my blood

I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone

I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead
I'll take another step for you
I'll shed my tears until I drown, or until I am underground
I'll take another breath for you...
Will you still be there when I'm home, out from the great unknown?

It's like there's cancer in my blood
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone

Weigh down
Weigh down on the way down

I've lived behind a mask
So long so few know who I am
They know other sides of me
That hide behind a haunted man

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They save me from myself
And they stand by me

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

I'll fight fatigue, I'll fight for you
For everything that we've been through
I'll take your hand, I'll carry on
I've been weighed down for far too long

Though my hands are made of stone
And I break everything I see
They save me from myself
And they stand by me, stand by me

Weighed down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

I won't be weighed down
There's too much resting on this
Never be weighed down
I'll fucking stand here instead

Weigh down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong

I weigh down on the way down
I need someone to take my hand
It feels like I can't breathe
And I might drown on the way down
I'm sick of all the come downs
Don't tell me that there's nothing wrong
I'm weighed down, weighed down

(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
Let me hear you sing it
(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
So when the last light fades
Shine on
Shine on young love
you hold my hands
and I'll hold yours
then life won't feel so wrong
I know you're hurting like I am
I know your heart's in your hands
we share a life so bleak
with broken memories
Shine on
Shine on young love
you lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on (Shine on)
Shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together
but this lifts us up
(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
Let me hear you sing it
(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
So let the last light fade
Shine on
Shine on young love
We'll burn these fires bright
lets blaze our past into the night
Because it's been too long
and we have been too down
so now it's sink or swim
and we're too strong to drown
Shine on
Shine on young love
You lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on (Shine on)
Shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together
but this lifts us up
I've felt as helpless as you
Felt the will to give in
Let your heart open up
Let the healing begin
Find your way to the light
and fight the will to give in
It's sink or swim
and we're too strong to drown
It's sink or swim
and we're too strong to drown
We'll take our time
and make a change
This is our chance to sail away
We'll take our time
and make a change
This is our chance
So let the last light fade
Shine on
Shine on young love
You lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on
Shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together
but this lifts us up
Shine on
(lifts us up)
You lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on
(lifts us up)
You know we're all sinking together

Hey, what did you hear me say?
You know the difference it makes.
What did you hear me say?

Yes, I said it's fine before,
But I don't think so no more.
I said it's fine before.

I've changed my mind,
I take it back.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
I've changed my mind.

So, where did you see me go?
It's not the right way, you know.
Where did you see me go?

No, it's not that I don't know.
I just don't want it to grow.
It's not that I don't know.

I've changed my mind,
I take it back.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind...
Erase and rewind...
I've changed my mind.

I don't know what you're looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up, you spread me all around
In the dust of the deed of time

And this is no case of lust you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone

I'm losing my favourite game,
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby,
Losing my favourite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission in a lethal fight
I should have seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body is blue

And I'm losing my favourite game,
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my favourite game,
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby,
Losing my favourite game

I'm losing my favourite game (losing my favourite)
You're losing your mind again (I try)
I try but you're still the same (I try)
I'm losing my baby, you're losing a saviour and a saint

This is only the start
You're only opening the book
You're only on the first line of what's going to take a little while
I hope you don't hold your breath because they revolt like a choir
They say the language is dead, well, then why do we speak
I hope you understand that my brain is fixed.

Into the next town
This is only a revolt.

Enough is enough because we cannot be late
Basically, you've been defined as "unworthy of love"
And I confess, I had placed in my heart the same address but I paint with my words
"You're free, don't fear, this is just a revolt".

Into the next town
This is only a revolt.

Calm rose: violent wind
The only "surrender" tonight, shall not be our own
They cannot escape, one if by land, two if by sea
Because I saved my money, but it can't save me
And maybe there is blood from the past, but that is not from me
They can take away one man, and they can take away his might
But they cannot take us all
No, they can't dig a hole the right size to fit all of our dreams
They can't bury me, they can't bury me
We can't hope that somebody else take our place
No, we can't hope that somebody else take our place.

May the history book read of all of our names
Be it blood, be it ink, but at least we were free
This is only but a fraction of what I've got to say
It must be said, it must be said
If I leave this earth tonight may it be said that I spoke my peace
I spoke with the wrath of his grace
Calm rose: come violent wind
Oh we stand hand in hand and we walk without fear
This is a revolution!

Come out of the cupboard
You boys and girls

Now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania
Has bitten the dust

London calling
See we ain't got no swing
Except for the ring
Of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming
The sun's zooming in
Meltdown expected
And the wheat is growing thin

Engines stop running
But I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning and I
Live by the river

London calling
To the imitation zone
Forget it brother
You can go it alone

London calling
To the zombies of death
Quit holding out
And draw another breath

London calling
And I don't wanna shout
But while we were talking
I saw you nodding out

London calling
See we ain't got no highs
Except for that one
With the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming
The sun's zooming in
Engines stop running
And the wheat is growing thin

A nuclear error
But I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning and I
Live by the river

The ice age is coming
The sun's zooming in
Engines stop running
And the wheat is growing thin

A nuclear error
But I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning and I
Live by the river

Now get this.....

London calling
Yeah I was there too
And you know what they said?
Well some of it was true

London calling
At the top of the dial
And after all this
Won't you give me a smile?

London calling

I never felt so much a-like.....

The kingdom is ransacked, the jewels all taken back
And the chopper descends
They're hidden in the back, with a message on a half-baked tape
With the spool going round, saying I'm back here in this place
And I could cry
And there's smoke you could click on

What are we going to do now?

Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?
'Cause working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!
When we're working for the clampdown

We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

The judge said five to ten but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown

Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
Do you know that you can use it?

The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you

The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy, get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

You grow up and you calm down
And you're working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
And you're working for the clampdown

So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
You made your first kill now

In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown

Ha, get along, get along
Working for the clampdown
Ha, get along, get along
Working for the clampdown

Yeah, I'm working hard in Harrisburg
Working hard in Petersburg
Working for the clampdown
Working for the clampdown

Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flying in on a DC-10 tonight

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died up on the hill
They sang The Red Flag, they wore the black one
After they died it was mockingbird hill

Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb is drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My señoritas rose was nipped in the bud

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón

The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echoes from the days of '39?
Trenches full of poets, a ragged army
Fixing bayonets to fight the other line

Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearing music from another time
Spanish bombs, Costa Brava
I'm flying in on a DC-10 tonight

So let's cut the conversation
And get out for a bit

Because I feel it all fading

And I'm begging to drag you down with me
To kick the last nail in

Yeah I like you in that
Like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth
Then I cannot be responsible for

Quite what goes in
Or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair
Just pull on your pout

And let's move to the beat
Like we know that that it's over
If you slip going under
Slip over my shoulder

So just pull on your face
Just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time

(I Spy, Spiderman, softer than shadow and quicker than flies)

On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun (sun)
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering (shivering) in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and suddenly
A movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do
When I realise with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow
And quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
"Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman (the Spiderman) is having you for dinner tonight (for dinner tonight)"

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

(the Spiderman, the Spiderman is having, is having me for me for supper)

I really don't know what I'm doing here
I really think I should've gone to bed tonight
But just one drink
And there're some people to meet you
I think that you'll like them
I have to say we do
And I promise in less than an hour we will honestly go
Now why don't I just get you another
While you just say hello
Yeah just say hello
Just say hello

So I'm clutching it tight
Another glass in my hand
And my mouth and the smiles
Moving up as I stand up
Too close and too wide
And the smiles are too bright
And I breathe in too deep
And my head's getting light
But the air is getting heavier and it's closer
And I'm starting to sway
And the hands on all my shoulders don't have names
And they won't go away

So here I go
Here I go again

Falling into strangers
And it's only just eleven
And I'm staring like a child
Until someone slips me heaven
And I take it on my knees
Just like a thousand times before
And I get transfixed
That fixed
And I'm just looking at the floor
Just looking at the floor
Yeah I look at the floor

And I'm starting to laugh
Like an animal in pain
And I've got blood on my hands
And I've got hands in my brain
And the first short retch
Leaves me gasping for more
And I stagger over screaming
On my way to the floor
And I'm back on my back
With the lights and the lies in my eyes
And the colour and the music's too loud
And my head's all the wrong size

So here I go
Here I go again

Yeah I laugh and I jump
And I sing and I laugh
And I dance and I laugh
And I laugh and I laugh
And I can't seem to think
Where this is
Who I am
Why I'm keeping this going
Keep pouring it out
Keep pouring it down
Keeping it going
Keep pouring it down

And the way the rain comes down hard
That's the way I feel inside

I can't take it anymore
This it I've become
This is it like I get
When my life's going numb
I just keep moving my mouth
I just keep moving my feet
I say I'm loving you to death
Like I'm losing my breath
And all the smiles that I wear
And all the games that I play
And all the drinks that I mix
And I drink til I'm sick
And all the faces that I make
And all the shapes that I throw
And all the people I meet
And all the words that I know
Makes me sick to the heart
Oh I feel so tired

She moves abstract just
Like a shadow dancing on the edge
Like a storm cloud passing overhead
Effortless and free

As the hours rush by
Through her, I can sense the end of time
There's no way this can forever shine
Make the sun not rise

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
But the killer won't survive

She moves abstract just
Like a shadow dancing on the edge
Like a storm cloud passing overhead
Hypnotizing me

As the hours rush by
Through her, I can sense the end of time
Stretching to eternity divine
And the sun won't rise

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
But the killer won't survive

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
And the killer won't survive
And the killer won't survive

Survive

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
But the killer won't survive

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
And the killer won't survive

I wish that you didn't love me no more
I've been dead for years
I wish that you didn't own me no more

Spill the lies in your bed
I will give you a holy white rose
Cut the tongue from your head

The wound is wise for primal black eyes

Giving up the fight once more

Cannot scratch the itchy spot, the psyche sore

Help me out, my psyche really aches
Notion leading me astray
Will you help me letting out the truth?
I'm about to lose

Watching my face worn out with guilt
I couldn't make out myself no more
I've let the itchy spot grow large
Entangled with what I've done before
I broke up my life, and theirs

Help me out, my psyche really aches

(I'm not dead yet)

Now you take a new turn
Let the old burn
Transform what you once were
Into a berserk

Resurrection, breathe crisp air
Not crippled with fear
Rebirth, open your eyes
Come into life

(I'm not dead yet)

Refreshed you dare a new start
Submission's no brave thing, you would not give in
You re-animated machine,
With muscles, and wit, and nerves extreme

(I'm not dead yet)

Run and hide
Face what you think must be faced, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Flee from the menace you have aroused, for it is powerful

So, you're an energy pack
Strong and young, you should never be wrecked
There ain't no challenge too big for you
In your limbs the fire burns, burns, burns

But no way you'll win, no matter how you try
Against powers older than life
You'll get nowhere but back
With your one-dimensional superhero attitude

(I'm not dead yet)

Run and hide
Fight what you think must be fought, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Duck in the dirt, in a hole, in the ground, go!
Run and hide
Run to be safe, to be whole, to be free
Run and hide
Don't try to fight, try to flee, try to live by

(I'm not dead yet)

Run, you berserk of sensitive skin
Are you ready to fail?
You've got forty seconds, then:
Better be off, for we are fed up
With your making noise
You are nothing but something to be swept off
You overestimate yourself
You are bold but a mortal fly
You are strong, strong, strong
But alone you must strive

(I'm not dead yet)

Run and hide
Do what you think must be done, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Run, save your head, save your life, save your breath, go!
Run and hide
Don't try to fight, try to flee, try to live by
Run and hide
Seek shelter before it's too late
Run and hide
Fight what you think must be fought, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Run to be safe, to be whole!

Oh, it's kind of different, trancer

So cruel and so evil the mastery's right
it was a necromancy of unknowing preachers
lascivious lashes slave-trade in Kareyth
It was a forcing the style when the reverends pray
It's idolatry at night this place forces to die
So the force of religion corrodes in Kareyth

Now hanging in Kareyth

It's the spasm of anguish in Kareyth's slaves' eyes
Neuralpathics are victims of the priests' seduction
It's a place of too sinful a suffering the source of all plights
It was a necromancy of unknowing preachers

You woke up and rose in silence
Crisis on you you
Turn white you recall that slaughter
You turn sideways
and turning your eyes you see her body
These eyes hurt your soul
These eyes of dark were eyes so tragic
Crisis on you

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

No ways to endure that beauty
Crisis on your deepest thoughts and innermost lust
Cry water
These eyes of dark were eyes elliptic
And a graveyard for you a tragedy
To once have seen them
A tortured smile

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

Eyes elliptic

The shapes of disgrace
Will make us behave like a nervous Jesus

The shapes of disgrace
Will make us behave like a nervous Jesus

You woke up and rose with silence
Corrupted by sexual desires
Still greater is that bad yearning
For your gazing at those eyes you admired
Your acting has brought you disaster
You'll cry forever more now
You'll cry like salty rain

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

I can't stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn't matter where I've been. Can't give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it's time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.

I've been here one time, two times, now three times before.
Long enough not to wait around for that knock upon my door.
I'm staring at the face of doubt so I can't forget who I'm cutting out.
Why put in my all just to watch my buildings fall?

Hey, hey, I'm living for today.
Forgetting things I can't change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.

It all comes down to this. Both truth and consequence.
I need something more than an empty promise.
To believe in something, just one thing, that will never go wrong, not today.
Letdown after letdown, I'm done.

Hey, hey, I'm living for today.
Forgetting things I can't change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.

Count the clock till the overhaul.
You built a bomb inside my walls.
Count the clock till we're out of hand.
You build, build now we're caught in the avalanche.

Reset, rebuild. You wrecked this city but not my will.

The second hand looks like a knife. As it's counting down the rest of our lives.
So hard to swallow. No steps to follow. It became so hard to survive.

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands.
We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.

All I have to keep are these jaded old memories from screams of how it used be.
I once was blind but now I can see that words of rationality were wasted on me.

So I said goodbye. It's just a memory, that hasn't come to be.
But I recognize that if you're on the right track but catch the wrong train,
Nothing ends the same.

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands.
We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.

Dear youth, put back those thoughts in my head.
The ones where I believe that I am boundless again.
I know we're at the end of the road. This is our story, this was our home.

We were unbreakable.

Alive and well. The days are shrinking.
Alive and well. Each moment more fleeting.
Alive and well. We gave our best.
Alive. And well, you know the rest...;

There's a hurricane raging inside me. The second wave is right there behind me.
Don't leave me alone, as this fire burns whole. Before there's nothing left to atone.
Breathe new life into me. Send waves to crash right through me.
I wear the perfect disguise, right behind my eyes.

Its got me coming undone.
My facade made of stone. I'm deep beneath now, I need to let go.
This life has taken it's toll. I can't be myself pleasing everyone else. No!

First one up in line when there is hell to pay. Filthy hands that never wash away.
This is one time I won't being subjective.
I need to see things from a brand new perspective.

Because I'm coming undone.
My facade made of stone. I'm deep beneath, now I need to let go.
This life has taken it's toll. I can't be myself pleasing everyone else. No!

I'd like to think I'd never cave in. A vicious battle I may never win.
And I'd like to think I'll come out stronger. Life's swinging hard but I'm swinging harder.

And although that I roam all over the world, the spending's never done."

I leave behind this sentiment to the man that I'll become.
Telling him not to be burdened by the things that I have done.
The longest days and endless nights have become the routine.
Far beyond frustration. It's the end to all my means.

Constantly incomplete.

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick.
I will rise above them all like this.

I may not be forgiven, but I forgave and I'll forget.
Going through the motions is no way to exist.
So if there's anybody out there that's so sick of feeling alone,
Has the damage already been done? You gotta get from underneath that gun.

We walk before we run.

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick.
I will rise above them all like this.

Move me, choose me. Please before you lose me.
Find me, drive me. End the things that pride me.
Move me, improve me. Ignite the flame that ruled me.
Guide me, collide me. I need something to survive me.

Coming back against all odds, I stack brick by brick. I will rise above them all like this.

Consider this my endnote to be read when I'm gone.
I have always been looking for this, dying for this, but It seems I've lost track.
This is everything I believed in. This is what I'll take back.

We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.
We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. It's only us who feel the consequence.

I choose to start today because I'm longing for a life less plagued.
Where we both know, that if we both go, then we leave behind an empty page.

Why would I fight a war when I've lost everything I'm fighting for?
Why do you turn your head when together we could wake the dead?

This is not beyond repair.
This is a certainty. This is a must for me.
Because it's not beyond repair.

We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.
We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. It's only us who feel the consequence.

You can't break me.
I have taken the stand and I have earned my place.
Those who breed disgrace remain faceless.

With my head held high, I'll give until I am gone. You can't break me.
With my head held high, I've been here all along. You can't break me.

It appears that we can't rely on common sense.
Let's act our age and turn the page on this intolerance.
Because we're not meant to live like this. By-products of ignorance.

This is out of control, it's out of control, it's gotta go. You're scared of what you don't know.
I'll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

Always failing to be accepting cause hatred stems from uncertainty.
Speaking down from above casts a shadow on the ones in search of the sun.
You think you're better than me? Your words of "wisdom" are spreading disease.
But you won't get the better of me. Walk in these shoes before you trample my feet.

This is out of control, it's out of control, it's gotta go. You're scared of what you don't know.
I'll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

We tear each other down to build ourselves up. A system failure, enough is enough.
"Cause in a world this shaky and unstable, we've got to be less fucking hateful."
Knuckles white. This is beyond aggression.
Knuckles white. Because we need new direction.

This is out of control, it's out of control, it's gotta go. You're scared of what you don't know.
I'll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

We believe in a system that has long been broken.
We turn the other cheek without a glimpse of emotion.
Always looking out for number one. Why do you need more while others have none?

Measure my worth by what I've done, not what I've become.

I spanned the oceans. I've seen the skies. That's all I'm ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, aren't even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesn't mean that you need.

We've come so far from the lives that we're meant to live.
But there's so much more that I have left to give.
We always borrow time that can't be given back.
We let it slip away and never pick up the slack.

I spanned the oceans. I've seen the skies. That's all I'm ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, aren't even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesn't mean that you need.

This is not a dream cause I am not asleep.
I'll need more than a metaphor if I want to earn my keep.
My head is in clouds. My feet are on the ground. Even if I fall I'll always stand proud.

I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.
Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.
I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.
I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long road.

Day in, day out, your heart's growing colder.
Your prying hands can't lift that chip off your shoulder.
Fade in, fade out, you fight with apathy.
Don't cloud my vision when you're the one who can't see.

I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.
Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.
I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.
I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long way home.

I was always talking to myself because nobody would stick around.
Developed my own language and now I'm the loudest in the crowd.
(Now I have to) ask myself why they wanna stick around?
It's funny how they lift you up before they put you in the ground.

Remember those things we were all meant to fear.
And laugh as we realize they all got us here.
I am the one. Unfortunate sun.
My death made a mark while your lives faded away.

I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.
Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.
I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.
I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long way home.

There's no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I've given up control. I suffer just to run with the wolves.

So I sing these words to the fortunate. The ones who look alive.
Never living life in disconnect, through someone else's eyes.

Whoa, I can't find my way.
There's no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I like a fool, am burned. I give and give with no return.

Whoa, there's no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I've given up control. I suffer just to run with the wolves.

Nothing will be earned by skipping stones.
Lessons won't be learned through broken bones.
One by one, we're losing ourselves.
Like a flame burning out, but I have a light.
When you're in the dark and out of doubt, find me.

God, what have I done?
I've lost myself for no one.

Whoa, I can't find my way.
There's no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I like a fool, am burned. I give and give with no return.

Whoa, there's no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.
And I've given up control. I suffer just to run with the wolves.

The second hand looks like a knife. As it's counting down the rest of our lives.
So hard to swallow. No steps to follow. It became so hard to survive.

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands.
We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.

All I have to keep are these jaded old memories from screams of how it used be.
I once was blind but now I can see that words of rationality were wasted on me.

So I said goodbye. It's just a memory, that hasn't come to be.
But I recognize that if you're on the right track but catch the wrong train,
Nothing ends the same.

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands.
We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.

Dear youth, put back those thoughts in my head.
The ones where I believe that I am boundless again.
I know we're at the end of the road. This is our story, this was our home.

We were unbreakable.

Alive and well. The days are shrinking.
Alive and well. Each moment more fleeting.
Alive and well. We gave our best.
Alive. And well, you know the rest...;

True dedication most just do not posses
When push becomes shove, can you rise above the rest?
Waves of words, they fall short and crash at my feet
Such are the ways of the weak.

"I'm not scared!" It's all that I know
Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go
I've been digging up bones
Remnants of what made up me that I've never shown.
This is my time to rise.

Dark horse. I'll fight my way to the top.
You will never be the thorn in my side
Dark horse. Dreams are my driving force
Open your eyes. Go live your own life.

"I'm not scared!" It's all that I know
Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go
I've been digging up bones
Remnants of what made up me that I've never shown.

When the smoke clears, and the damage is done.
I'll be the only one left standing
I see someone without a shred of hope
At their breaking point. At the end of the rope.

"I'm not scared!" It's all that I know
Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go
I've been digging up bones
Remnants of what made up me that I'll never show.

No excuse for the years you've spent cold.
Spreading words like fire to build an arm,
Just to watch them burn.
You want to watch them burn.
You can't trust this.

All these false prophets stand before me
Spitting venom just to make you all believe
So full of hate and negativity
It's not the answer. It won't set you free.

Spreading words like fire to build an arm,

Suffocated by the air that you need
Never leaving the cold
Sacrificing everything you could be
Because it's what you've been told
When you look in the mirror what do you see?
Tell me what do you see. What do you see?
Is it everything that you wanted to be?

I'll reclaim everyone you betrayed
Because the tides will change when you've been sent to your grave.

Overturn the throne. You chose a side doomed for failure.
Overturn the throne. I'm here to turn the tides of war.

You're running with the wolves
Inflicting fatal wounds
You're just a naysayer, that will never be me.

Grab ahold of me, I've got my arms up.
Pull me out from this darkness.
It's so hard for me to see so light up the end of that tunnel.

If it's a war you came to see you will never see a waved white flag in front me.
I can't end up dead, I won't be misled. I'll keep singing this song inside my head.

A phoenix rise? Or your demise?
Do I have to put your name on this grave? Or give you one more shot?
This addiction came like a freight train, oh!
You're coming off of the rails again.

This will not be the new revival or a claim to fame.
Far away from the slings and arrows is where you go to pass your blame.
It's the ones with no courage that can't face the day.
A captain with no ship is just a castaway.

I sent my heart out to sea. I sent out my everything.

A crown atop your head does not make you a king.
A crowd that follows does not mean you can lead.
Take this for what it is. We all know who's to blame.
You're not going to find your place.
You're just a face with no name.

The weak prey on the weak, and I'll be the first to say.
That I don't have all of the answers.
Sometimes I run away.
But I set out on this course, continue with no remorse.
I know who I am, and it's enough for me.

I sent my heart out to sea. I sent out my everything.

A crown atop your head does not make you a king.
A crowd that follows does not mean you can lead.
Take this for what it is. We all know who's to blame.
You're not going to find your place.
You're just a face with no name.

I sent my heart straight out sea. Will it make its way back to me?

I've been so lost because all I've found is hatred and corruption.
Can my heart weather this storm?
And through the cold stay warm? I said!
If it makes its way back to me. I can survive anything.

You watch the clock wind down and let the days go by.

We look up to the sky, I swear it never ends.
Walk down the road on any path we choose.
But then something changed, now days just aren't the same.
I'm feeling so empty like part of me has been removed.

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold.
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn't belong.
Where did I go wrong?

Let me stop to ask the question, "Will I ever get the chance to repeat?"
I feel this more and more everyday. Take me back to when I used to believe.

Nothing could prepare you, but we try our best.
Failure upon failure, what happens next?
Nothing's ever easy and life still goes on.
Don't stop push on before you become withdrawn. I've become withdrawn.

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold.
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn't belong.
Where did I go wrong?

My innocence is gone. Where did I go wrong?
I feel it slipping away from me. Do you remember when we were free?

I've stood up on that ledge, and I know what you see:
You're looking over the edge and wanting to leap.
I've written every word and expressed all my concerns.
You're losing that part of yourself, but it wasn't meant to be.

I could tell you what you want to hear to hold you off another year.
But I hope the truth finds you well.
A common praise. A passing phase.
Moving forward? Not today!
The limit's in the sky, but will you be reaching it tonight?

Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.
"I'm alive!" Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that,
"I'm alive, and I'm not going anywhere!"

No chance to be free. No chance to soar in the sky.
Your feet fixed to the ground.
Desperation is what's weighing you down.
Whether my strength be heaven sent or my own self-confidence.
These days when I'm walking through a crowd.
I don't have to hold my head down.

No more wasting time. Burn bright like a star, ignite.
The limit's in the sky but will you be reaching it tonight?

Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.
"I'm alive!" Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that,
"I'm alive, and I'm not going anywhere!"

"Be a leader and never ever follow"
That's what my father, that's what he always told me.
So with those words boldly spoken, he sent me down a long and hard road.

Shrug it off my shoulders, it was never meant for me.
I won't waste my time in mediocrity.

Sometimes we get so low
Downsides are all we see
Your world is swallowed whole
And now you're all alone waiting for me
I put my faith in the ones
I trust to stick it out
Who never tuck their tail and run
That's what friendship's all about.

I'm sick of waiting for my life to come to me
So I singing "I'm not waiting"
You want to know how this all has come to be?
Because I lean on the ones beside me
Go and do what makes you happy
That's what I'm saying
I'm done waiting for my life to come to me
So I'm headed into the great unknown
And I'm not going alone.

Cast aside left to fend for yourself your back is to the sun
Repeat your words over again "I don't need anyone"
In a world that wants nothing more than to break me down
I can take on anything with my true friends around
You could never hold me down.

I'm sick of waiting for my life to come to me
So I'm singing "I'm not waiting"

Go and do what makes you happy

I'm done waiting for my life to come to me
So I'm headed into the great unknown.

I put my faith in the tried and true
It's just you and me with nothing to lose
Keep those you trust right by your side
Only the strong will survive.

This life is constant sacrifice.
I laid myself out for the world to see.
This time I'm going to get it right.
My past should be more than just a memory.
I said that I would give anything to live my life out and follow my dreams.

You left some hope instilled in me
That I never should give up on anything
I know this made you proud of me
So this song remains for those who hurt like me.

The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown.
The man in black. He rides alone: he's moving on. Not coming home.

I used to be the fearless one.
Living each day like death would never come
Now I feel his cold breath on my neck
He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next.

Before I used to take these wings and I'd fly so high
(I'd fly so high. I tried.)
Now I live in regret never coming down to say goodbye
Oh why can't I?

The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown.
The man in black. He rides alone: he's moving on.
I can't follow.

I used to be the fearless one.
Living each day like death would never come
Now I feel his cold breath on my neck
He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next.

So make way for the man in black
So make way. He's never coming back.

I am so lost at sea
Ryan, shine the light for me
I'm sinking, I can't swim
I need you here to pull me in
I am so lost at sea
Ryan, shine your light for me
I'm sinking, I can't swim
I miss you brother.

Leaving our skin

Sleep walking through these last few weeks,
and still you persist to suffocate the last
breath of life from my lungs.
Now my last thought was of you screaming my name.
The anguish in your voice as I collapse in pain.
Don't hold your breath for me, because I will let you down.
Now as I'm losing my voice, never found.
And if you get there,
don't even bother calling,
cause by the time you read this.
Instill in me your dignity.
With pride you wast another life of possibility.
Run the clock down on us.
I live in the corner you've backed me into.
And if you get there,
don't even bother calling,
cause by the time you read this,
I'll be gone.
And when I said I loved you,
I swear to god I lied.
Die motherfucker,
you and your reason why.
Am I tearing apart your life,
because you're tearing apart mine.
Now you won't see what I have made for you.
Inside I gave you everything.
Rely on me until I shatter.
Instill with me the peace you found.
And so I'm never coming back, until you're gone.
I can't save you, I can't save you.
But I want to be hopeful.
I don't know you, I don't know you, but I want to.

If you can stand on your own two feet

Stand up and wash
away the blood

You've given me reason
to tear you apart.
Now you can't fix whats already broke

Now I'll have you know.

Don't surrender,
never give up your fucking life.

I eat you away from within
You'll never see the sun again

helpless to her beckoning

so come lets play these games
until we bleed or until we choke

you spent your life just withing you were dead
so you tried and tried but then said these things take time
so overwhelmed with guilt that clouds my head

become the daggers and I'm left bleeding.
These wounds of trust I know
as tunnel vision creates
my only sanctuary. As hope manifests
itself in the thought
of an end. A dying breath.
Reap my soul.
I'm not sure I can go on.
So drag me down
into your world.
Replace my heart
with your machine
and see if it still bleeds.

Become my enemy.

Reap my soul
My eyeslids become my enemies
I fight them to save myself
from the scene.
As the groundwork for my nightmares
is created
I stand helpless to this chaos in my head
and yet the chaos stands beautifully now
like a carefully designed city of conformity.

And I'll keep you awake tonight
and I'll hurt you
until sunrise
in this attempt to displace
this pushing attack on my senses.
Reap my soul
I'm not sure I can go on.
Now drag me down
into your world.
Replace my heart with
your machine
and see if it still bleeds
I'll cover my tracks
so you can't trace
this accident to me.

Drag me down now.

Switchblade feel the tempered steel
Against your skin so innocent
Orchestrate this demise and
Shut up and pay attention
Searching for an artery of
Blind affection digging for this vein
To tap dry then savor
Shut up and pay attention
Eyes wide with surpasses only by my own
So scared of the consequence

Shut up and pay attention
I want someone to listen
Now you don't believe me
How I won't let you hear a word that I said

You're all I want to know
You're all I want to hear
You don't know what you mean to me
You don't know what it means to be

Switchblade lock action into place
Quick release such a pretty face
Too late the time for taking long since passed
Shut up and pay attention
Quiet please you had your chance. now
Setting in like wet concrete
Reality begins to harden
Shut up and pay attention

I never noticed the color of your eyes
Until I saw them in the reflection of this knife.
Green with envy for a life you never had.
Bloodshot contempt when I extend my hand
(So breathe and show us what you've got underneath
clench your fists until they bleed)

See how and why I know
I don't think that this is what I want anymore
I don't care if God can save me now
Here I sit with hands cupped and head bowed
And I wonder if you're out there have you seen my name in lights?
I don't care at all
In this world of kiss & tell I've got no stories to speak of now
Silence fills this empty hole
So naive to think, that I could make you feel one thing

This excavation of my chest has produced nothing
Bow your head and pull your eyes down to see
My hand around your wrist
Turn and twist this blade deeper into me
(You can't always get what you want
but if you try sometimes you'll die on you knees)
Wait 'til the perfect comes
Until it comes

can't you see right now my hands are bleeding
blisters broken dripping from the ceiling
I don't want to be here now
I've fallen apart and I can't pick up the pieces
I cry in the dark and cup my ears to seashells
to hear the solitude it brings

so many faces - so many voices - so many reaaons
to give this up and this goes on and on

can't you hear right now my ears are ringing?
my head held in my hands to stop the spinning
it stops only to start again
my home has long since been replaced
with a world this window pane

have I finally gone too far to come home?
this world might wait for me tonight, but she won't
now only time will tell if these wax-wings will melt
only moments to spare

we fall asleep with the color of the sunrise
we count the years on circles under our eyes
we dream in shades of blue and gray
we speak in tongues of metaphors and stories
we bleed the ink of subtle allegory
we are the needle in the hay

Somehow I knew that this would end
and then I finally found my way back home.
And this is all one master plan
to keep us spinning down this endless well
I'm drowning in my own regrets
I'm trying so hard to take what's my last breath.
This is all I wanted from you.
So alone and now I'll have you know

If you can stand on your own two feet
then you can get up off your fucking knees.
Stand up and wash
away the blood
that stains your soul.
You've given me reason
to tear you apart.
Now you can't fix whats already broke

Now I'll have you know.

Don't surrender,
never give up your fucking life.
you lied
about
your pride in self.
I pushed from inside your skin
I eat you away from within
You'll never see the sun again

I'll have you know
look away
from this broken mirror
now the time has come to
slow the beating of this heart.

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord
And you swear to me you don't want to be my slave
But you're staring at me
Like I need to be saved

In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the lord
And you swear to me
That you don't want to be my slave
But your staring at me
Like I'm driving the nails

Nails!

Like i'm driving the nails!

Nails!

In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
Like it's the coming of the Lord
Would it pay you more to walk on water,
Then to wear a crown of thorns?
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Then to bury you poor

In your Jesus Christ pose

I hold you and I am fearless
I touch you and I'm not afraid
I see you and I'm overcome
With feeling I cant explain

Come say that to my face
And I'll rip out your fucking tongue
I reckon you you don't know my name
Take it for granted while the blind
still dream in colors they've not yet seen

You are a deadline I can't make
Better late then never I always say
The last of the romantic
Take this for granted while the blind
Still dream in colors they've not yet seen
And scrawl their thoughts
On pens that ran out of ink

no one to blame but myself

I see your face in the sky
Someday I'll put this behind
I'm getting on with my life

I tried to tell you everything
But my voice is too loud
I tried to hold you close to me
But my claws are too sharp

I've seen that dead look before
Too paralyzed to move
Don't try to hold me back
'Cuz you're so afraid to lose

The same thing that keeps me alive
is the same one I'll gladly bite
(tell me) That your sorry
(tell me) That you love me
(tell me) That you'll be here now
While I go blind
Still dream in colors they've not yet seen
And scrawl their thoughts
on pens that ran out of ink

I see your face in the sky
Someday I'll put this behind
I'm getting on with my life

I tried to tell you everything
But my voice is too loud
I tried to hold you close to me
But my claws are too sharp
But I tried

I see your face in the sky
Someday I'll put this behind
(I tried to tell you everything but my voice is too loud)
I'm getting on with my life
And they tell me to look alive

I found out what you did today, so run
I know where you live and I'm on my way, so run
I'll waste my life on death, so run
I want to taste your final breath, so run

Go your own way
Go your own way
(The city grieves in unison)
Go your own way

But she loves him more then anything
Crawling home on hands and knees
One day I pray that time licks these wounds clean
So smile away the last five years
Smear cascades of mascara tears

(Black, red eyes bled)
Forever

I want you to see what I've become
A hurt I would not wish on anyone
You taught us to trust no one
We are your fucked up creation

Go your own way
Go your own way
(The city grieves in unison)
Go your own way

But she loves him more then anything
Crawling home on hands and knees
One day I pray that time licks these wounds clean
So smile away the last five years
Smear cascades of mascara tears

(Black, red eyes bled)
Forever

White picket fences line these dreams they keep us out!
(Never!..)
Or do keep them in?!
(...Leave you!)
Her eyes scream pain that no one ever sees
(Deaf ears put this dull ache to sleep)
As she braces herself for the final blow
Remembering tears of not so long ago
(Everything that onces fell into place is falling apart)

And your all I have
(You've given me nothing!)
And your all I can see
(You've left me blind!)
So lets stay here together
Lets rot here together
Six feet under our love

We don't need no miracles
We seize on every moment
Come on baby, ride this movement

Do you think they really love you
As they kill and rise above you
We know they don't really love us
They can never really love

The more I love
The more I feel like making revolution
The more I make revolution
The more I feel like making love

We're not revolutionaries
Sittin' 'round and talkin' theories
We speak in a different fashion
Our language is direct action

For every one or two to stop us
We multiply three or four
No one or army can stop us
Cut 'em down on the killin' floor

The more I love
The more I feel like making revolution
The more I make revolution
The more I feel like making love

Do you think they really love you
As they kill and rise above you
Do you think they really love us
As they kill and rise above us
We know they don't really love us
We know they can't really love us
We know they won't really love us

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart,
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart.
Many many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you.
What can I do?
Don't want nobody, nobody,
'Cause baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.

Is it true what they say about you?
They say you never ever, ever been true.

It doesn't matter what they say,
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do about you?
Don't want nobody, nobody,
'Cause baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.

Baby!
Oh!
Baby!

It doesn't matter what they say,
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do without you?
Don't want nobody, nobody.
Baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.

Don't leave me all alone
Baby, come on home
Baby, it's you
Baby baby, it's you

You know I need your love, babe
Oh, baby, come home
Oh baby, it's you

All my life I've been fighting fear
Been dragged and buried in this world alone
The sounds of thunder I could always hear
Had me feeling so sick I called this hell my home

I left my love and everything behind
I know where I'm going
Won't be turned around
Until it breaks I'm holding down the line
'Til we are free from the marching sound

I know what is true
I know what to do
and I'll see it 'til it's through

Hold your battleground
Where the hammers sound
Hold your battleground
'Til the final round

I'm young and fearless
With a fist of stone
Learned to stand on my feet
But this is not my land
I've seen my reflection and I'm not alone
We'll take it all instead of what we can

We know what is true
We know what to do
and we'll defend it 'til it's through

Hold your battleground
Where the hammers sound
Hold your battleground
'Til the final round

Until we are free
We won't be moved or be turned around
Until we are free
We'll keep on rising to the marching sound
The marching sound!

Hold your battleground
Where the hammers sound
Hold your battleground
'Til the final round

Every mornin' head into the mines
Breathin' in that devil's dust
You put in all your time
Doing what you must
So the bills don't fall behind

You didn't need any help then
And you won't be needin' any now
You got a load on your back
A chain around your heart
And a pride that's tearin' us apart

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt up
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

All the nights that I waited
For you to come home
And when you'd do we'd cuss and fuss
It ain't that I don't love you
It's cuz it's too much
And I couldn't tell you enough

But we made it through
All these years
What doesn't kill you
Only makes you stronger
And baby I know
Nothin's really changed
Only now we're a little older

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt up
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

Pull it back together

Every day you come home
A little more tired
I hear you coughin'
All through the night
Always another year
Until you retire
When the doctors say
You're not alright

You didn't need any help then
Surely you'll be needin' plenty now
You got a load on your back
Chain around your heart
And a pride that's tearin' us apart

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt up
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

Pull it back together

Woke up feelin' lonely
There's always something to be missed
I don't know if he regrets
Breaking me with a kiss

Devil comes knockin'
Don't have the strength to resist
I wanna lay it all down
But a voice tells me this ain't it

Pull me in
No, put me out
I'll be gone 'til
Your heart is lost for me

Woah… lost for me
Oh, you'll be lost for me

Cuz when the light
That you're holdin'
Shines no longer bright
Sometimes it's better
Not to see outside
So goodnight, my baby
I'm not your fight
Keep on…

I'll be alright

Love me through
The harshest winter
Break my blues
With your warmest summer
Hold my hand
In the hardest rain
We will dance with our tongues
In the air
Spin until we land
anywhere
Then I'll be gone 'til
your heart is lost for me

Woah… lost for me

With your head in the ground
You talkin' loud
But don't make a sound
Ya can't speak to power
In the killing fields

You think that flower power
Will make them stop
Bang! bang! bang! baby
Here come the cops
Power is power, love
No matter who's on top

Hush now, baby
You're in the killing fields

They want me to toe
The party line
But they ain't got the tools
And I ain't got the time
They'll take all your money
And leave your children behind

Bang! bang! bang! baby

Into tomorrow
We'll leave behind
Our chains and sorrow
We won't walk
With Pizarro
Follow the man with the
Flaming arrow

Blood!

Come on love
I know you want to
Reclaim the street with the
Berlin statue
We'll burn the streets
Regrow the forest
We'll rob the richest
Give to the poorest

Come on love
Come on love

I don't need it
I don't want it
Build another

I don't love it
I won't feed it
Find another

When the sun sets down
When the sun sets down
Gunpowder will wash the streets
With Indian blood
And the seeds of revolution
Will grow tight around
Our children's necks
Like nooses
That are used to keep
The slaves in check
In chains
And decades later
We still can't figure out why
It remains the same

(Blood)

Wake up love!
I want some action
Unlock the children
They'll make it happen
But if comfort
Is your coffin
Then pull the lever
And choose your killer

I don't need it
I don't want it
Build another

I don't need it
I won't feed it
Find another

I don't love it
I won't feed it
Build another

For so long
In the shit
It is my home
And I've been killing
Whether right or wrong

Between two sides
I'm drawn and owned
And a God
That has left me alone
I am no one
And I'll die unknown

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up

You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die

Has disappeared
Drowned in the memories
Of your tears
And your shadow
But it's still too near

No one to trust
Or truths to speak
I am the enemy

Lord forgive me
When the smoke clears

Strangers in a dark room
Laughing at jokes they didn't quite hear
Frosted window panes and cheap champagne
A face appears

And anything could happen in these cathedrals we roam
Where shadow people dance
And trade their glance
And walk home alone

Staring out the window
Of the Roosevelt Hotel
Watching Midtown empty out
And I kiss her farewell

They say we come from nothing
And to nothing we'll return
And in between is gravity
And bridges left to burn

(I still believe in God, but God no longer believes in me)

There's a crystal view from my window
And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm them barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So dance on the graves where the hammer falls

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

You can touch, but please keep your distance
You're innocent and pure and with no shame
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is graved
Your teasing your torment with the pleasure of pain

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

Heaven and Hell, I know them well
But I haven't yet made my choice
My feelings dead 'cause I'm shouting loud
And no one can hear my voice
Walking the tightwire, can't look down
Strung out high, above you all
Faithful wind blows through this land
Howls my name, Hell is my fall

Day after day your home life's a wreck
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect, you get no relief
You gotta speak up and yell out your piece

So back off your rules, back off your jive

Leave me alone, not asking a lot

'Til someone around you hears what you say

Mota!

Every day, well it's the same
That bong that's on the table starts to call my name
I take a hit and zone out again
I'll be paranoid and hungry by a quarter to ten
Watching reruns on my TV
I'm laughing off my ass at three's company
I don't now if I'm understood
but hearing Jimmy Buffett never sounded so good

Your memory's gone and so is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy's you and so is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out might feel okay all night
Mota

I'm driving down to the Barrio
Going 15 miles an hour cause I'm already stoned
Give the guy a twenty and wait in the car
He tosses me a baggie then he runs real far
I take a hit but it smells like a clove
Oh FUCK I got a baggie of oregano
This ritual is destroying me
But I guess it could be worse
It could be methedrine

Your memory's gone and so is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy's you and your couch is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out might take
Losing out might take you all night

Mota!

Your memory's gone and so is your life (your life)
Mota boy
But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy's you and so is your life (your life)

But losing out might feel okay all night

Yeah losing out might feel okay all life

On the way
Trying to get where I'd like to stay
I'm always feeling steered away
By someone trying to tell me
What to say and do

I don't want it
I gotta go find my own way
I gotta go make my own mistakes
Sorry man for feeling
Feeling the way I do

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
But not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life
I can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks

By the way
I know your path has been tried and so
It may seem like the way to go
Me, I'd rather be found
Trying something new

And the bottom line
In all of this seems to say
There's no right and no wrong way
Sorry if I don't feel like
Living the way you do

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
But not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life
I can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks

She wakes up
Rage and grace
Pulling me closer, pushing away at me
The sharpest thorn on your vine
Twistin' and turnin', we're all intertwined

Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, "You know, we'd all like to rearrange"

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me

A beaming sunrise buries the night
The setting sun destroys the light
And she says, "Baby, I've gotta get going"
Cutting each other without even knowing

She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
All god's tears for her, they cry
And I am in her reign

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me

Broken wing

You gotta keep 'em separated

Like the latest fashion
Like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease

The gangs stake their own campus locales
And if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal
If one guy's colors' and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up

Hey!
Man, you talkin' back to me?
(Take him out)
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey!
Man, you disrespecting me?
(Take him out)
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey, don't pay no mind
If you're under eighteen, you won't be doing any time
Hey
Come out and play

By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste

It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter, no one's learning the score
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own

Hey!
Man, you disrespecting me?
(Take him out)
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey!
Man, you talkin' back to me?

I'm getting edgy all the time
There's someone around me just a step behind
It's kinda scary the shape I'm in
The walls are shaking and they're closing in

Too fast or a bit too slow
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder, is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake
There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll but I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is, I gotta get away from me

I tell you something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends, they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped

If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
I'm being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creeping on the ground

Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake
There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll but I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is, I gotta get away from me

Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me

Whoa-oah-oah
Whoa-oah-oah
Whoa-oah-oah
Whoa-oah-oah

Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake
There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take

La, la, la la la, la, la, la la la

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert

Oh, I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay, 'cause I got no self esteem

Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

We make plans to go out at night
I wait till two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can stand
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care
Right?
Yeah!

Now, I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

Now, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh that I'm like a disease

Well, I guess I should stick up for myself

When we were young our future was so bright (whoa, oh!)
The old neighborhood was so alive (whoa, oh!)
And every kid on the whole damn street (whoa, oh!)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat

Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (whoa, oh!)
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (whoa, oh!)
How can one little street
Swallow so many lives?

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Whoa!)

Jamie had a chance, well she really did (whoa, oh!)
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (whoa, oh!)
Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job (whoa, oh!)
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot

Jay committed suicide (whoa, oh!)
Brandon OD'd and died (whoa, oh!)
What the hell is going on?
The cruelest dream, reality

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see

Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the format
Build with skill, with technique, computer A-DAT
My lyrical form
Is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought flow
Acrobat
Sink the track
Pump the track
Dance missions
Clubs like spores react past those visions
And hurrying more
Reflects on the dancefloor
Blowing up
And having mad people showing up
Packing crowds
Jam-packed venues
Needles collapse
While atmospheres continues
Sprinkle that
Winnin' like that
Movin' like that
Hittin' like that
The melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss
With Prodigy
Kickin' astrology
My intellects devour
With diesel power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta...

Winston back rewind - diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantasically
It has to be
Automatically
Check it out
You better work it out
Change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords of mikes hanging like spring leaves
Do a track so fast, beyond from you and I
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
E's and pepped up
You get swept up
Smacked up, backed up
Your crew's all cracked up
Check it - slow pick
Choose quick
You can't stick
My medical range is strange as angles
You get tangled
Twist inside affections
Channels repeat
Complete
Can't compete
Check that our texture
Mind adventure
Exploit the point
Into tracks to devour
My intellects proceed
With diesel power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta...

Back
Attack
The whack
Pack your fax to me
You don't want none
High quality action be
Still standing, damaging your other manic
Quick reverse
Potent as the first verse
My amplifier
Blows on your worlds, higher
World's sire
Cuts like a barbwire
Record - play
I pull up on you every day
Fast forward
I move and I swing toward
Exit - load
Put your brain in write mode
Selected mix
The man will perfect the fix
Heads lightly
Bite me
Copy Xerox
Cops' handblocks
You can't knock some out there
I've been lifting
Shifting
Persisting
Intelligent kingpin
Keeping astrology
As I roll with Prodigy

With diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta...

Model 706-8073421, robot sonic

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically

Thanks that I'd like to say
For the rage that I feel
The rage that I feel today

Gotta stack, gotta stack
Stack of chips on my shoulder
In everything I do
'Cause I made, I made
I made the mistake of trusting you

People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire

People like you just burn

Yeah, my layers are thick
And I've got bad attitude
Yeah, that knife in my back
Has fingerprints that belong to you

Got a grudge, got a grudge
Got a grudge that I'm holding
For as long as I live
'Cause you lied, you lied
You lied to my face
And it's something that I can't forgive

I see your face in such a lonely place,
But you're a million miles away.
I've got your photograph and you've got mine,
We said we'd meet again someday.

I won't forget you,
And I won't let you fade away.
I'll run beside you.
I may decide to stay.

What place and forces in the universe
Are responsible for this?
I was rejected, when we connected,
And you sealed it with your kiss.

I won't defy you,
I'll be right by you all the way.
Sometimes it's hard to find the words,
The words to say...

I miss you, I miss you
More and more each day.
I miss you, I miss you
More than I can say.

I see your face in such a lonely place,
But you're a million miles away.
I've got your photograph and you've got mine,
We said we'd meet again someday.

I won't forget you,
And I won't let you fade away.
I'll run beside you.
I may decide to stay.

Go away

I miss you, I miss you
More and more each day.
I miss you, I miss you
More than I can say.

Our friends think we're crazy,
We live so far away.
But baby, don't you listen,
Don't you listen to what they say.

I miss you, I miss you
More and more each day.
I miss you, I miss you
More than I can say.

Don't get me started on the things that I've been hearing.
You have forgotten the face of your father and now you have been disgraced.

You say I got to wear a tie to church,
and I can only get to Heaven through my works,
I hate to tell you but you're full of shit.
Earthly things mean nothing to eternal kings.

Here we go

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy

I bet you're gonna say this song is offensive,
a little over the top and abrasive,
if that is what it takes to wake you up,
sign me up.

You get your money so your steeple's steep,
Your flock is made up of the sick and the weak.
I hate to tell you but you're full of shit.
Earthly things mean nothing to eternal kings.

Here we go

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy

Look into my eyes
I am the one who you despise
Cause I exposed your lies
And it's my turn to watch you burn (to watch you burn)

I hope you choke
On the letters that you wrote
Telling me that you will be here 'til the end
You'll never see
A different side to me
A side that you just did not ever understand

Sing it like last time
With every line
Ends with a rhyme
You'll get great reviews
But I refuse to be reused (to be reused)

I hope you choke
On the promises you broke
Telling me that you would always be my friend
You'll never see
A different side to me
A side that you just did not ever understand

I hope you choke (on the messages you wrote)

I thought I knew it all
It doesnt matter, if you believe me or not
Our hope is shattered
And any chance at love is shot

I'll take this sign to
Try and show u a way out
But once you enter
You'll know what I'm screaming about

My god what have I done?
I can feel the flames around me
As something pulls me deep into the earth

My god am I in hell?
Cuz the waters getting higher
But I cant seem to breathe
I did this to myself

Hear me out now
It's not to late for you to change
But if you don't now
You'll have only yourself to blame
I have to go now
To the place that owns my soul
I should have listened
But now it's outa my control

My god what have I done
I can feel the flames around me
As something pulls me deep into the earth

My god am I in hell
Cuz the waters getting higher
But I cant seem to breathe
I did this to myslef

My god what have I done

You can see how it's all coming down
Close your eyes
Just give in
Divided we fall but together we win

I don't know if I can make it on my own
I need you 'cause you have always helped me through

It is time
Cross the line
I want only to help free your mind
Send your doubts
I'm with the wind
Divided we fall but together we win

I don't know if I can make it on my own
I need you 'cause you have always helped me through
Hopefully this is only just a dream
'Cause I can't live without the only one who makes me feel
Anything

At all (oh)
Anything
At all (oh)

I don't know if I can make it on my own
I need you 'cause you have always helped me through
Hopefully this is only just a dream
'Cause I can't live without the only one who makes me feel
Anything

In the heat of the night
In the heat of the day
When I close my eyes
When I look your way
When I meet the fear that lies inside
When I hear you say
In the heat of the moment
Say, say, say:

Some day, some day, some day
Dominion!
Come a time
Some day, some day, some day
Dominion!
Some say prayers
I say mine

In the light of the fact
On the lone and level
Sand stretch far away
In the heat of the action
In the settled dust
Hold hold and sway
In the meeting of a mind
Down in the streets of shame
In the betting of names on gold to rust
In the land of the blind
Be king, king, king, king

In the land of the blind
Be king, king, king, king

Some day, some day, some day
Dominion!
Some say prayers
I say mine

In the heat of the night
In the heat of the day
When I close my eyes
When I look your way
When I meet the fear that lies inside

We serve an old man in a dry season
A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A kino runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift, nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:

Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down, down, down
Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down

Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down, down, down
Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down

Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down, down, down
Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down

And when your nerves break your thought
And my word break your will
And the heart break me over this wheel

We are coming down
We fall
Hand in hand in hand in hand

We are coming down
We fall

We are coming down
But we will
Never never land

I had a face on the mirror
I had a hand on the gun
I had a place in the sun
And a ticket to Syria

I had everything within my reach
I had money and stuff
Each and every call
Too much but never enough
Tear it up and watch it fall

We are coming down
We fall
Hand in hand in hand in hand

We are coming down
We fall

We are coming down
But we will
Never never land

With our backs to the sky
And our eyes on the ground
With the clouds far below
No horizon around
With the wind in our face
And our arms open wide
We will pass through this place
To the other side

All the days of our lives
All the ways of our calling
Follow...

I had a face on the mirror
I had a hand on the gun

Everybody shouts on I Love Lucy
Pee Wee reads the evening news
A pre-owned song or a second-hand Uzi
Everybody got a job to lose

Here come the golden oldies
Here come the Hezbollah
Businessmen from South Miami
Humming an AOR

Meanwhile...

I like Cal and his dog Napalm
I like Ike and his itty-bitty A-bomb
Everybody got one, I want mine
You can order it up on Channel Nine

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on, and on, and on

There was a time but it's long gone
Janie got a crush on the Viet Cong
Burning through downtown Saigon
But me, I'm sold - down the Mekong

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on, and on, and on

Guns, and cars, and accidents
The threatened witness my defence
You can sell one another for fifteen cents
Well bye-bye mother, it's common sense

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on, and on, and on

Everybody shouts on I Love Lucy
Pee Wee reads the evening news

Businessmen from South Miami
Humming an AOR

Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more

Oh, I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know:
I want more... I want more!

(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)

D'you get scared to feel so much?
To let somebody touch you?
So hot, so cold, so far, so out of control
When hard to come by, the harder to hold

Some people get by

(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)

There are parts of me that don't get nervous --
Not the parts that shake
You won't get what you deserve,
You are what you take

Learning to cry for fun and profit,
I'm not done yet
Counterfeit dollars or the English zloty,
Anything I can get

Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more

Oh, I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know:

Es ist wie jedes Jahr dasselbe (Januar, Februar, März, April und Mai),
der Winter ist schon lang vorbei und der Frühling auch fast rum,
die Temperaturen gehen langsam höher, dicke Jacken sieht man kaum,
und eines morgens wachst du auf und dann ist sie da.

Endlich Sommerzeit,
wir stehen auf Sonne, Strand und Meer.
Endlich Sommerzeit,
wir stehen auf Sonne und Strandverkehr.

Jetzt kannst du es gar nicht mehr erwarten (mo-di-mi-do und f-r),
das Wochenende schon ganz nah, denn da hat man noch was vor,
den Bulli schnell noch voll gepackt, es geht gen Norden richtung Meer,
man fährt der Freiheit stets entgegen, dein Mädchen an der Hand.

Endlich Sommerzeit,
wir stehen auf Sonne, Strand und Meer.
Endlich Sommerzeit,

Und ist man endlich angekommen,
die Freunde sind schon alle da und der Grill schon ausgepackt,
aus den Boxen satter Sound, man hört und tanzt zu Skamusik,
ihr seid sicher sie ist da, die schönste Zeit im Jahr.

Endlich Sommerzeit,

Seit knapp 2 Stunden lieg ich neben dir wach,
dabei habe ich mir denn so gedacht,
wie es wohl sei, wenn wir zusammen wären,
dann bräuchte ich dir auch nicht erklären,
warum meine Hände dich berühren,
ich würd dich jetzt so gern verführen.

Doch weil wir leider nur Freunde sind,
und uns immer mehr die Zeit verrinnt,
wir nur so tun, dass wir zusammen wären,
lieb ich trotzdem das, was wir füreinander sind.

Seit knapp 2 Jahren denk ich oft an dich,
weiß nicht, weshalb denn eigentlich,
ist alles okay, so wie es ist,
nur das eine, das ich so vermiss,
wahrscheinlich nie real sein wird,
aber mir immer mehr den Kopf verwirrt.

Doch weil wir leider nur Freunde sind,
und uns immer mehr die Zeit verrinnt,
wir nur so tun, dass wir zusammen wären,
lieb ich trotzdem das, was wir füreinander sind.

It's like a dream
From which I'm never waking
And it's like a scene
That has a different show

Inside of me
That never has an ending
Though inside you bleed
That cutting you for more

It's like a feel
That everything is falling
And it's like the night
Is swallowing the day

The clear blue sky
Resentments are awaking
And I feel the tears
Are washing me away

I feel so far away
I feel so far away
Far away, far away
Far away, far away

It's like a war
Where everyone has died
And it's like a flash
Of lightning in the night

It's like you're sinking
Deep into the bottom
Like inside to feel
Like giving up the fight

It's like the price
That's only just my design
To push you on
To make you believe

It's like a gun
To take you to the bottom
Make you realize that
There's nothing there to prove, yea

I feel so far away
I feel so far away
Far away, far away
Far away, far away

Far away, far away
Far away

Our love is lost
And
I'm still so far away
You see me far away

Something keeps me holding on
You see me far away
I'm dreaming far away
Until the dream is gone

And it's all in how you mix the two
And it starts just where the light exists
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
And it burns a hole
Through everyone that feels it

Well, you're never gonna find it
If you're looking for it
Won't come your way, yeah
Well, you'll never find it
If you're looking for it

Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you

And you never would have thought in the end
How amazing it feels just to live again
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it

Well, you're never gonna find it

It's all I've got just to stay down,
Why the fuck am I still down?
I'm hoarding all that's mine
Each time I let just one slip by,
I'm wasting what is mine

You almost always pick the best times
To drop the worst lines
You almost made me cry again this time
Another false alarm
Red flashing lights
Well this time I'm not going to watch myself die
I think I made it a game to play your game
And let myself cry
I buried myself alive on the inside
So I could shut you out
And let you go away for a long time

I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back
You're gonna have to ask

I think the chain broke away
And I felt it the day that I had my own time.
I took advantage of myself and felt fine
But it was worth the night
I caught an early flight and I made it home

I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back
You're gonna have to ask

Nicer than that

With my foot on your neck
I finally have you
Right where I want you

The cup is not half empty as pessimists say
As far as he sees nothing's left in the cup
A whole cup full of nothing for him to indulge
Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up

A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere
He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was...
Is just a tragedy

So he voyages in circles
Succeeds getting nowhere
And submits to the substance
That first got him there, there, there, there

Then in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness and all that he was...
Is just a tragedy

He feels alone
His heart in his hand
He's alone
He feels alone
I feel...

Then on that last day he breaks
And he stood tall
And he yelled
And he yelled
Why

(And he takes his life)
Then in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness and all that he was...
Is just a tragedy

Is it worth it, can you even hear me?
Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry
I'm tired and I've felt it for a while now
In this sea of lonely
The taste of ink is getting old
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still I can see it coming
While I'm standing in the river drowning
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye
At last it's finally over
Couldn't take this town much longer
Being half dead wasn't what I planned to be
Now I'm ready to be free

So here I am, it's in my hand
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this

And won't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright lit city
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
We'll drink and dance the night away, drink and dance the night away

So here I am, it's in my hand
And I'll savor every moment of this

When we're not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation

I wake up alone
With only daylight between us
Last night the world was beneath us
Tonight comes too long

Were we torn apart
By the break of day
You're more than I can believe
Would ever come my way

Fiction
When we're not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation

Come real life
Why do I refuse you?
Cause if my fear's right
I risk to lose you

And if I just might
Wake up alone
Bring on the night

Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation

An uncertain haze
How am I to tell?
I know your face all too well
Still I wake up alone

I saw you again
It felt like we had never met
It's like the sunset in your eyes
And never wanted to rise

And what have you done
With the one I love
When I look into your eyes
I see no surprise

I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met

We make believe
I've never seen your face, you neither mine
Don't catch my eye
Don't register a smile

You were more than just a friend
Oh, but the feeling
It never came to an end
I can't bear you seeing

I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me

When I see you again
I'll know not to expect
Stay one step away
We won't have to wave

When I see you again
And I'm greeted as a friend
It is understood
When we did all we could

I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met

You've applied the pressure
To have me crystalised
And you've got the faith
That I could bring paradise

I'll forgive and forget
Before I'm paralysed
Do I have to keep up the pace
To keep you satisfied

Things have gotten closer to the sun
And I've done things in small doses
So don't think that I'm pushing you away
When you're the one that I've kept closest

You don't move slow
And taking steps in my direction
The sound resounds, echo
Does it lessen your affection, no

You say I'm foolish
For pushing this aside
But burn down our home
I won't leave alive

Glaciers melt into the sea
I wish the tide would take me over
I've been down on my knees
And you just keep on getting closer

Glaciers melted to the sea (things have gotten closer to the sun)
I wish the tide would take me over (and I've done things in small doses)

What I have is right here
Spend my nights and days before
Searching the world for what's right here

Underneath and unexplored
Islands and cities I have looked
Here I saw
Something I couldn't overlook

I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore

See what I've done?
That bridge is on fire
Back to where I've been
I'm froze by desire
No need to leave

Where would I be?
If this were to go under
That's a risk I'd take
I'm froze by desire
As if a choice I'd make

And I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore

You say you think we are the best thing

In another's company by the sea
When I go out to the pier
Gonna dive and have no fear

Ein Schiff wird kommen.
Wir sind die Nacht durchgefahren.
Jetzt stehen wir Hand in Hand an der Autobahn.

Panzer und Laster rollen an uns vorbei.
Wir haben gestern abend Niedersachen erreicht.

Die Luft riecht nach Benzin
und jemand gibt uns Tee
in eine Tasse auf der "Los Angeles '84" steht

Und der Wind weht vom Moor
und alle Menschen stellen sich vor
wies wird
Im Sommer nach dem Krieg
wenn eine Briese vom Meer über die Häuser fliegt.

Wir springen auf einen Laster.
Der Fahrer sieht ängstlich aus.
Kilometer 48 - in der Ferne raucht ein Haus.

Wir erzählen uns schnell
was wir hörten, was wir sahen.
Wir waren hier mal im Urlaub irgendwann vor ein paar Jahren.

Und der Wind weht vom Moor
und alle Menschen stellten sich vor
wies wird
Im Sommer nach dem Krieg
wenn eine Briese vom Meer über die Häuser fliegt.

An der letzten Straßensperre steht ein alter Mann.
"Wollt ihr wissen wie der Krieg aussieht?" fragt er uns und dann
fängt er an zu rennen
auf die Grenze die sich schließt
ein Soldat guckt beiseite, ein anderer schießt.

Und der Wind weht vom Meer
und alle Menschen stellten sich vor
wies wird
Im Sommer nach dem Krieg
wenn eine Briese vom Meer über die Häuser fliegt.

Ebb and flow, the sea is cold but my blood comes to boil
I feel it filling up my lungs, the weight pulls me to soil
Current takes me, breath escapes me, inducing coma sleep
Close my eyes, I'm paralyzed, finally at peace

Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?
Drown?

Lay there floating, body bloating, skin turnin' to gray
I built my castle, the dirty rascal finally got his way
Waves roll in and clean my sins, now everything is clear
I'm havin' fun under the sun, wishin' you were here

Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?
Drown?

A thousand leagues, I live and breathe along the ocean floor
Now submersed, I join the cursed to float here evermore

Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?

My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots
Tip the man he'll ring the bell, get her drunk she'll scream like hell

Dirty girl, getting down, dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, acting tough, mess with her, she'll fuck you up
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend

Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
I say, no one really knows just how far she's gonna go
But I'm gonna find out later tonight

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend

Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
The time of her life
My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it

She's a gold digger, now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger
Future's finished, there it went, savings gone, the money spent
I look around and all I see, no good, bad and ugly
Man she's hot and fixed to be, the future ex-Miss Connolly

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end

The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn't stay away
Don't you know the bitch came back?

I like her so much better when she's down on her knees
Cause when she's in my face that's when I'm starting to see
That all my friends will laugh at thinking that we'd be wrong
Well she's so fuckin' stupid that she's singing along

The trouble with girls is they're all the same
Forget the diamonds and pearls they just want a ring
Before you know it you're like a dog on a leash
Well you can try and change the world but you won't change me

The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn't stay away
Don't you know the bitch came back?

There she goes again just always breaking my balls
No matter what I do somehow it's always my fault
She says I must be cheating cause I turned off my phone
But that's the only frickin' way she'll leave me alone

The trouble with girls is is never enough
They love to complain and they never shut up
They like to tell you the way it ought to be
Go on and tell the world but just don't tell me

The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn't stay away
Don't you know the bitch came back?

It ain't a joke when I say I wanna throw you out
(I really mean it, I really mean it)
Well look who's laughing now!

The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
She just couldn't stay away

Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she won't stay the f*ck away

It's never enough to say I'm sorry
It's never enough to say I care
But I'm caught between what you wanted from me
And knowing if I give that to ya I might just disappear

Nobody wins when everyone's losing

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind

It's like trying to turn around on a one way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I'm starting to see
Maybe we're not meant to be

It's never enough to say I love you
No it's never enough to say I try
It's hard to believe, that there's no way out for you and me
And it seems to be, the story of our life

Nobody wins when everyone's losing

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind

It's like trying to turn around on a one way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I'm starting to see
Maybe we're not meant to be

There's still time to turn this around
Should we be building this up instead of tearing it down
But I keep thinking maybe it's too late

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind

It's like trying to turn around on a one way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I finally see
Baby we're not meant to be

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I'm, baby I'm sorry to see
Maybe we're not meant to be

What will grow crooked you can't make straight
It's the price that you gotta pay
Do yourself a favor and pack your bags
Buy a ticket and get on the train
Buy a ticket and get on the train

'Cause this is fucked up, fucked up
'Cause this is fucked up, fucked up

People get crushed like biscuit crumbs
And laid down in the bitumen
You have tried your best to please everyone
But it just isn't happening
No, it just isn't happening

And it is fucked up, fucked up
Well this is fucked up, fucked up
This is your blind spot, blind spot
It should be obvious, but it's not

You cannot kickstart a dead horse
You just cross yourself and walk away
I don't care what the future holds
'Cause I'm right here and I'm today
With your fingers you can touch me

I am your black swan, black swan
(But I made it to the top, but I made it to the top)
This is fucked up, fucked up
(I'm a baby in the dust, I'm a baby in the dust)

We are black swans, black swans
(But I made it to the top, but I made it to the top)
And for spare parts we're broken up
(I'm a baby in the dust, I'm a baby in the dust)

You are fucked up, fucked up
This is fucked up, fucked up
We are black swans, black swans
And for spare parts we're broken up

I can't escape this hell
So many times I've tried
But I'm still caged inside
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal, this animal)

I can't escape myself (I can't escape myself)
So many times I've lied (So many times I've lied)
But there's still rage inside
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me

Somebody help me through this nightmare

Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can't escape this hell

Just let me say one thing; I've had enough
You're selfish and sorry, you'll never learn how to love
As your world disassembles, better keep your head up

Your name, your face is all you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced; you've been erased

So long, so long, I have erased you
So long, so long, I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long, I have erased you
I have escaped the bitter taste of you

Just let me clear my head, I think I've had too much
You're so disappointing but you make good use of it
As your world disassembles, better keep your head up

Your name, your face is all you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced; you've been erased

So long, so long, I have erased you
So long, so long, I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long, I have erased you
I have escaped the bitter taste of you

Your name, your face is all you have left now
Disgraced, betrayed; you've been erased

So long, so long, I have erased you
So long, so long, I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long, I have erased you
I have escaped the bitter taste
I have escaped the bitter taste of you

Tonight my head is spinning
I need something to pick me up
I've tried, but nothing is working
I won't stop, I won't say I've had enough

Tonight, I start the fire
Tonight, I break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can't stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

At night I feel like a vampire
It's not right but I just can't give it up
I'll try to get myself higher
Let's go, we're gonna light it up

Tonight, we start the fire
Tonight, we break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can't stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

If you can't stand the way this place is

"Do it! Hit him again!"
"Get 'em, yeah, get 'em!"
"Bust his head!"

He wakes up haunted with voices in his head
Nobody knows it but today he won't go unnoticed
He can't forget, can't forgive for what they said
He's never been so hurt but today the screaming is over

Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe he needed to be wanted
Blame the family, blame the bully
Maybe he needed to be wanted

She takes the long way home, fighting her emotions
She's a loner but tonight she won't go unnoticed
If she can't remember when she loses her temper
Nobody knows her but tonight the silence is over

Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Took me down to the river so I could drown, drown, drown
Looking up through the water, I kept sinkin' down, down, down
I feel like I'm dyin', I got one foot in the ground
Never knew what love was until you came around

You're goin' down
You're goin' down, down
You walk all over me, you never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now, now that you're goin' down

Take you down to the basement, you look around, 'round, 'round
We sit there in silence, I watch you go down, down, down
I feel like I'm flyin', I got my head in the clouds
Never thought I was crazy until you came around

You're goin' down

'Cause I know you're not there and I know that you don't care
I can hardly wait to leave this place

No matter how hard I try you're never satisfied
This is not a home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a

By the time you come home I'm already stoned
You turn off the TV and you scream at me
I can hardly wait till you get off my case

She just walked away
Why didn't she tell me, and where do I go tonight?
This isn't happening to me, this can't be happening to me
She didn't say a word, just walked away

You were the first to say that we were not okay
You were the first to lie when we were not alright
This was my first love, she was the first to go
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know

Why didn't she tell me where to go tonight?
She didn't say a word, she just walked away

You were the first to say that we were not okay

This was my first love, she was the first to go
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know

I'll be the first to say that now I'm okay
And for the first time I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love; you'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead, you'll be the last to know

Every time I turn around
And you say, you should've been gone by now
And you think that everything's wrong
You ask me how to carry on
We'll make it through another day, just hold on

'Cause life starts now
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now

I hate to see you fall down
I'll pick you up off the ground
I've watched the weight of your world come down
And now it's your, your chance to move on
Change the way you've lived for so long
And find the strength you've had inside all along

'Cause life starts now
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now

All this pain, take this life and make it yours
All this hate, take your heart and let it love again
You will survive this somehow

And you're so far down

I always knew that you'd come back to get me
And you always knew that it wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start to see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom to watch how it all ends

You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said, "I'm nothing without you"
(I'm nothing without you)

Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind, I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you

You always thought that I left myself open
But you didn't know I was already broken
I told myself that it wouldn't be so bad
But pulling away took everything I had

You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said, "I'm nothing without you"
(I'm nothing without you)

Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind, I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, in you

The pain of it all, the rise and the fall
I see it all in you
Now every day I find myself saying
"I want to get lost in you"

"I'm nothing without you"

Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind, I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found (Somehow I found)
A way to get lost in you

A way to get lost (A way to get lost)

I will not leave alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late, it's never too late

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's

Every street in this city is the same to me
Everyone's got a place to be but there's no room for me
Am I to blame when the guilt and the shame hang over me?
Like a dark cloud that chases you down in the pouring rain

It's so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
But it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you?

It's not what it seems when you're not on the scene
There's a chill in the air
But there's people like me that nobody sees
So nobody cares

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you?

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who can keep it together when you've come undone?
Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?

I swear this time it won't turn out the same
'Cause now I've got myself to blame
And you'll know when we end up on the streets
That it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you?

I'll be coming home just to be alone
'Cause I know you're not there and I know that you don't care
I can hardly wait to leave this place

No matter how hard I try you're never satisfied
This is not a home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home

By the time you come home I'm already stoned
You turn off the TV and you scream at me
I can hardly wait till you get off my case

No matter how hard I try you're never satisfied
This is not a home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Only when I stop to think about you, I know
Only when you stop to think about me, do you know?

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?

I hate, you hate
I hate, you love me

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

You were built for blessing, but you only make them bleed, but you don't care.
And bruises are but shadows of the blackness that you breed, but you don't care.

The light that's left inside their eyes is darkened day by day, but you don't care.
Your presence pulls the color from the world, 'till all is grey, but you don't care.

No, you don't 'cause you are less than half a man, yellow belly and crimson hands.
You will one day reap your reckoning, and maybe then you'll understand.

Your hands were made to comfort, but they only conjure fear, but you don't care.
And she's in the closet praying, "Lord, please get me out of here," but you don't care.

What mercy have they known from you, to ask that it be shown to you?

Tell me, are you free, tell me, are you free?
In word or thought or deed
Tell me, are you free?
While the gallows stand

Bullets lance the bravest lungs
We fold our hands and hold our tongues

Tell me, are you free?
When the fear falls on you
Tell me, are you free?
When the fear falls on you

Tell me, are you free, tell me, are you free?
In word or thought or deed
Tell me, are you free?
While the gallows stand

Bullets lance the bravest lungs
Will I fold my hands or hold my tongue?
Or let the flames lick at my feet
And breathe in fire and know I'm free

Flames will rise and
Devour me
To breathe in fire
And know I'm free

We are the image of the invisible
Free will is ours and we can't let go
We are the image of the invisible
We can't allow this, the quiet cull
We are the image of the invisible
So we sing out this, our canticle
We are the image of the invisible

We all were lost and we are found
No one can stop us or slow us down
We are the named and we are known
We know that we'll never walk alone

We're more than static and dial tone
We are the image of the invisible
We're emblematic of the unknown
We are the image of the invisible
So raise the banner, bend back your bows
We are the image of the invisible
Remove the cancer, take back your souls
We are the image of the invisible

We all were lost and we are found
No one can stop us or slow us down
We are the named and we are known

Though all the world may hate us, we are named

We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars

We dream of tunnels and of sleeping guards
We dream of blackouts in the prison yard

Heartbroken we found
A gleam of hope
Harken to the sound
A whistle blows
Heaven sent reply
However small
Evidence of life
Beyond these walls

Born and bred
In this machine
Wardens dread
To see us dream
We hold tight
To legends of
Real life
The way it was before

We dream of jailers throwing down their arms
We dream of open gates and no alarms

We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars

Eines Morgens bist du in der Fremde
Aufgewacht. Deine Hände
Zittern noch, du hörst in dich hinein
Doch das wird erst der Anfang sein

Du weißt nicht, was dich geritten hat
In diese tote Küstenstadt
Um dich verstreut liegen deine Papiere
Muscheln und Schalentiere

Du spürst die Gifte im System
Willst nur den Abend überstehn
Da sind Löcher unter deiner Haut
Du bist aus Schwamm geba-aut

Aus deinem Wohnsitz in der Tiefe
Schreibst du deinen Freunden Briefe
Sie lesen jede Zeile
In ihrer Wüste der Langeweile

Aah
Ah-ah-aah
Ah-ah-aah
Ah-ah-aah

Du schreibst, du lerntest deinen Hass zu tanzen
In der Schule der Extravaganzen
Und du schriebest die Diplomarbeit
Über Empfindlichke-eit

Weil sich die Gegenstände widersetzen
Suchst du vergeblich an vertrauten Plätzen
Du zitterst noch und hörst in dich hinein
Was könnte das Ereignis sein?

The night has no eyes
My fever has no heat
And the shadows cure my hate

A theatre of visions plays in my head
Malarial consciousness now remedied
Old grayface, play a song for me
A dissonant tune, a weird lilt

Damp neonlight fills the streets
I search for an anchor
Between monolithic towers of empty life
Pour me a glass of amnesia

Bleak your teeth of pure stone
Sway your arms of concrete flesh
Search with eyes of thousand souls
Your piped veins in turmoil

Bleak your teeth of pure stone
Sway your arms of concrete flesh
Search with eyes of thousand souls
Your piped veins in turmoil

Rest your soul a little while
In the Café of Lost Dreams
An unspoken agony cooled down
The old devourer bereaved a little

Greenlight flows all riverlike
A duke plays a jazzy tune
Glass-interspersed walls light up again
As clouds unveil the moonlit path
On which we all will walk one day

Ich komm aus der Wüste aus Stahl und Glas
Ich komm aus der Wüste aus Angst und Hass
Wo die Menschen verdursten auf der Suche nach Liebe
Krank vor Verzweiflung und vom Warten müde

Ich komm aus dem Land der vergifteten Straßen
Wo man den Tag verkaufen muss, um sorglos zu schlafen
Wo das Leben schneller ist als ein Herz schlagen kann
Und tausend Lügner sprechen bevor einer die Wahrheit sagen kann

Ich komm vom Planeten der verzweifelten Götter
Ich komm vom Planeten der reichen Bettler
Wo die Liebe verkauft wird und der Hass verschenkt
Wo man die Mörder belohnt und die Heiligen henkt

Hilf mir, hilf mir!
Zeig mir den Weg hier raus
Lass mich nicht hängen, gib mir 'ne Antwort
Zeig mir den Weg hier raus
Hilf mir!

Allein machen sie dich ein
Schmeissen sie dich raus, lachen sie dich aus
Und wenn du was dagegen machst
Sperr'n se dich in den nächsten Knast

Und alles, was du da noch sagen kannst
Ist: "Das ist aber 'n ganz schöner Hammer, ey Mann!"

Zu zweit, zu dritt, zu viern
Wird auch nix and'res passiern
Sie werden ihre Knüppel hol'n
Und uns ganz schön das Kreuz versohlen

Und alles, was du da noch sagen kannst
Ist: "Das ist aber 'n ganz schöner Hammer, ey Mann!"

Zu hundert oder tausend kriegen sie langsam Ohrensausen
Sie werden zwar sagen: "Das ist nicht viel"
Aber tausend sind auch kein Pappenstiel
Und was nicht ist, das kann noch werden
Wir können uns ganz schnell vermehren
In dem Land, in dem wir wohnen
Sind aber 'n paar Millionen
Wenn wir uns erstmal einig sind
Weht, glaub ich, 'n ganz anderer Wind
Dann werden se nicht mehr lachen
Sondern sich auf die Socken machen
Auf die Bahamas oder ins Tessin
Der Teufel weiß am besten, wohin

Und du weißt, das wird passieren
Wenn wir uns organisieren

Und du weißt, das wird passieren

Ich hab geträumt, der Winter wär' vorbei
Du warst hier - und wir war'n frei
Und die Morgensonne schien
Es gab keine Angst und nichts zu verlieren
Es war Friede bei den Menschen und unter den Tieren
Das war das Paradies

Aber ich werde alles geben, daß er Wirklichkeit wird
Aber ich werde alles geben, daß er Wirklichkeit wird

Ich hab geträumt, der Krieg wär vorbei

Es gab keine Waffen und keine Kriege mehr

Gibt es ein Land auf der Erde, wo der Traum Wirklichkeit ist?

Ich weiß nur eins, und da bin ich sicher:
Dieses Land ist es nicht

Acht Stunden Arbeit sind vorbei
Es sieht ganz so aus, als wärst du frei
Kannst dich vollaufen lassen, kannst ins Kino gehen
Und du kannst dein Geld im Puff ausgeben

Es ist Feierabend und die Arbeit ist vorbei
Rück den Kies raus, Junge, und du bist dabei

Hast 'ne Pause verdient, aber mehr auch nicht
Morgen gehts weiter, warte nicht
Spring mitten rein ins süße Leben
Du brauchst dein Geld nicht der Heilsarmee geben

Es ist Feierabend und die Arbeit ist vorbei
Heut ist Tanz auf dem Vulkan und du bist dabei

Besuch doch heute Abend deinen Chef
Und fahr mit seinem Mercedes weg
Gib ihm doch endlich seinen Lohn
Mach dich auf die Socken, er wartet schon

Mensch Meier kam sich vor wie 'ne Ölsardine
Irgendjemand stand auf seinem rechten großen Zeh
Das passierte ihm auch noch in aller Herrgottsfrühe
Im 29er kurz vor Halensee
Der Kassierer schrie: "Wer hat noch keinen Fahrschein?"
Und Mensch Meier sagte laut und ehrlich: "Ick!"
"Aber ick fahr schwarz und füttere mein Sparschwein"
Und der Schaffner sagte: "Mensch, bist du verrückt?"
Doch Mensch Meier sagte:

"Nee, nee, nee, eher brennt die BVG!
Ick bin hier oben noch ganz dicht
Der Spaß ist zu teuer, von mir kriegste nüscht!
Nee, nee, nee, eher brennt die BVG!
Ick bin hier oben noch ganz dicht
Der Spaß ist zu teuer, von mir kriegste nüscht!"

Und da sagte einer, du hast recht, Mensch Meier
Was die so mit uns machen, ist der reine Hohn
Erst wolln se von uns immer höhere Steuern
Und was se dann versieben, kostet unseren Lohn
Doch der Schaffner brüllte: "Muss erst was passier'n?
Rückt das Geld raus oder es geht rund
Was ihr da quatscht, hat mich nicht zu interessieren
und wenn ihr jetzt nicht blecht, dann kostet das 'n Pfund!"
Da riefen beide:

"Nee, nee, nee, eher brennt die BVG!
Wir sind hier oben noch ganz dicht

Nee, nee, nee, eher brennt die BVG!

"Halt mal an, Fritz!" brüllt da der BVG Knecht
"Ick schmeiß den Meier raus und hol die Polizei"
Doch die Leute riefen: "Sag mal, bist du blöd, Mensch?
Wir müssen arbeiten, wir haben keine Zeit
Und wenn die da oben X-Millionen Schulden haben
Solln'ses bei den Bonzen holen, die uns beklauen
Du kannst deinem Chef bestellen, wir fahr'n jetzt alle schwarz
Und der Meier bleibt hier drin, sonst fliegst du raus!"
Da riefen alle:

"Nee, nee, nee, eher brennt die BVG!

Wartet auf sie schon seit paar tausend Jahren

Ich mein die Menschenjäger und die Schreibtischtäter
Die uns Millionen mal ermordet haben
Sie zittern schon um ihren weißen Kragen

Wenn der Führer ruft, sind sie dabei
Sie sind zum Kaufen für die schlecht'ste Schweinerei
Und sie killen und denken nicht dabei
Sie sind der Grund für jede Schießerei

Menschenjäger, werdet ihr's kapieren?
Ich weiß nicht, wie viel heut durch euch alle krepieren
Aber eins kann ich euch garantieren:
Eure MGs werden nicht ewig regieren

Ihr könnt uns verfolgen und massakrieren
Doch für jeden, denn ihr kriegt, werden zwei andere marschieren
Ihr könnt gehorchen, ihr könnt kommandieren
Und kämpft ihr gegen uns alle, so werdet ihr verlieren

Komm ich abends nach Hause zu meiner Braut
Bisschen was zu fressen, hab ich bei Karstadt geklaut
Und ich sag zu ihr: "Puppe, ey ich bin heut so geil."
Und sie sagt: "Macht nix, Junge, schalt den Fernseher ein!"
Dann bin ich echt fertig und was ich stehn hab, das lass ich stehn
Den Abend, den kannst mich nur noch in einer Kneipe rumhängen sehn
Da sauf ich mich voll und wichst mich einer an
Dann kriegt er paar auf's Maul, solange ich kann
Und von dem ganzen Fusel penn ich zum Schluss ein
Der Wirt weckt mich um Fünf und quatscht: "Arbeit, Junge, muss sein!"

Ich geh unheimlich gerne auf den Rummelplatz
Ich steh auf Trubel und ich steh auf den ganzen Krach
Ich fahr paar Stunden lang mit der Achterbahn
Und schau mir die schöne Scheiße mal von oben an
Am Autoscooter fahr ich nen dicken Wagen
Ich fahr das ganze Jahr nur Mofa, jetzt kann ich auch mal jagen
Und an der Losbude hoff ich immer noch auf's große Los
Ich zieh nur Nieten, warum mach ich die Scheiße bloß
Aber an der Schießbude stehen, mit ner Knarre in der Hand
Da träum ich, ich knall alle Schweine ab
Denn uns, UNS gehört das Land!

Am Montag morgen in der Hafenstraße
Da saufe ich mir ein an und dann hol ich mir ne Waffe
Da schnapp ich mir nen Knüppel und dann fackel ich nicht lang
Und geht zum Chef auf's Büro und zieh die Krücke blank
Und wenn er dann winselt: "Verlassen sie mein Haus!"
Dann soll er sein Mittagessen lutschen, ich schlag ihm paar Zähne raus
Ich schrei: "Du Drecksau, gehst jetzt arbeiten für meinen Lohn!
Marsch ab in die Kolone, die anderen, die warten schon
Der Laden gehört jetzt uns allen, nicht mehr dir allein
Dein Wichserjob ist aus, wir mästen dich nicht mehr, die fettes Schwein."

Der Mariannenplatz war blau, soviel Bullen waren da
Und Mensch Meier musste heulen, das war wohl das Tränengas
Und er fragte irgendeinen: "Sag mal, ist hier heut 'n Fest?"
"Sowas ähnliches", sagte einer, "das Bethanien wird besetzt"

"Wird auch Zeit", sagte Mensch Meier,  stand ja lange genug leer
Ach, wie schön wär' doch das Leben, gäb' es keine Pollis mehr
Doch der Einsatzleiter brüllte: "Räumt den Mariannenplatz
Damit meine Knüppelgarde genug Platz zum Knüppeln hat!"

Doch die Leute im besetzten Haus riefen:
"Ihr kriegt uns hier nicht raus!
Das ist unser Haus, schmeißt doch endlich
Schmidt und Press und Mosch aus Kreuzberg raus!"

Der Senator war stinksauer, die CDU war schwer empört
Daß die Typen sich jetzt nehmen, was ihnen sowieso gehört
Aber um der Welt zu zeigen, wie großzügig sie sind
Sagten sie: "Wir räumen später, lassen sie erstmal drin!"

Und vier Monate später stand in Springer's heißem Blatt
Daß Georg-von-Rauch-Haus hat eine Bombenwerkstatt
Und die deutlichen Beweise sind zehn leere Flaschen Wein
Und zehn leere Flaschen können schnell zehn Mollies sein

Doch die Leute im Rauch-Haus riefen:
"Ihr kriegt uns hier nicht raus!
Das ist unser Haus, schmeißt doch endlich
Schmidt und Press und Mosch aus Kreuzberg raus!"

Letzten Montag traf Mensch Meier in der U-Bahn seinen Sohn
Der sagt: "Die woll'n das Rauch-Haus räumen, ich muss wohl wieder zu Hause wohnen"
"Is ja irre", sagt Mensch Meier "sind wa wieder einer mehr
In uns'rer Zwei-Zimmer-Luxuswohnung und das Bethanien steht wieder leer
Sag mir eins, ham die da oben Stroh oder Scheiße in ihrem Kopf?
Die wohnen in den schärfsten Villen, unsereins im letzten Loch
Wenn die das Rauch-Haus wirklich räumen, bin ich aber mit dabei
Und hau den ersten Bullen, die da auftauchen ihre Köppe ein"

Und ich schrei es laut:
"Ihr kriegt uns hier nicht raus!
Das ist unser Haus, schmeißt doch erst/endlich
Schmidt und Press und Mosch aus Kreuzberg raus!"

Und wir schreien's laut:
"Ihr kriegt uns hier nicht raus!
Das ist unser Haus, schmeißt doch endlich

Und wir schreien's laut:

Du hörst mich singen, aber du kennst mich nicht
Du weißt nicht, für wen ich singe, aber ich sing für dich
Wer wird die neue Welt bauen, wenn nicht du und ich?
Und wenn du mich jetzt verstehen willst, dann verstehst du mich

Ich bin aufgewacht und hab gesehen
Woher wir kommen, wohin wir gehen
Und der lange Weg, der vor uns liegt
Führt Schritt für Schritt ins Paradies

Ich hab lang gewartet und nachgedacht
Hatte viele Träume und jetzt bin ich wach
Wenn wir suchen, finden wir das neue Land
Uns trennt nichts vom Paradies außer unserer Angst

Name  Schritt Für Schritt Ins Paradies
Artist  Ton Steine Scherben
Album  Keine Macht für Niemand
Im Bett ist der Mensch nicht gern alleine
In meinem Bett ist grad noch Platz für dich
Doch mein Alter ist fast jeden Tag zu Hause
Und ich glaub, er hat was gegen dich
Für mich ist die Welt nicht mehr in Ordnung
Nicht früh um Sieben und auch nicht nach der Tagesschau
Für mich heißt das Wort zum Sonntag "Scheiße"
Und das Wort zum Montag "Mach mal Blau"

Wir müssen hier raus! Das ist die Hölle!
Wir leben im Zuchthaus!
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind zwei von Millionen, wir sind nicht allein
Und wir werden es schaffen, wir werden es schaffen

Mein Alter sagt, die Welt wird sich nicht ändern
Dabei weiß er ganz genau, was läuft
Doch er glaubt, er vergisst die ganze Scheiße
Wenn er abends in der Kneipe hängt und säuft
Er sagt, der schönste Platz ist immer an der Theke
Da hat er recht, zu Haus ist kaum noch Platz für drei
Darum bin ich auch den ganzen Tag auf Arbeit
Man kann sagen, ich bin so frei

Wir müssen hier raus! Das ist die Hölle!
Wir leben im Zuchthaus!
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind zwei von Millionen, wir sind nicht allein
Und wir werden es schaffen, wir werden es schaffen
Wir werden es schaffen

Und was kann uns hindern? Kein Geld, keine Waffen
Wenn wir es woll'n. Wir werden es schaffen

Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind zwei von Millionen, wir sind nicht allein
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind 60 Millionen, wir sind nicht allein
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Frei!

Album  Keine Macht für Niemand
Wenn niemand bei dir ist, du denkst dass keiner dich sucht
Und du hast die Reise ins Jenseits, vielleicht schon gebucht
All die Lügen, geben dir den Rest
Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest
Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest

Wenn der Frühling kommt und deine Seele brennt
Du wachst nachts auf aus deinen Träumen
Aber da ist niemand der bei dir pennt
Wenn der auf den du wartest, dich sitzen lässt
Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest
Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest

Wenn der Novemberwind deine Hoffnung verweht
Und du bist so müde, weil du nicht mehr weißt wie's weiter geht
Wenn dein kaltes Bett, dich nicht schlafen lässt
Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest
Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest

(Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest an deiner Liebe, halt dich fest an deiner Liebe
Halt dich fest an deiner Liebe, halt dich fest an deiner Liebe
Halt dich fest an deiner Liebe, halt dich fest an deiner Liebe
Halt dich fest an deiner Liebe, halt dich fest an deiner Liebe
Halt dich fest an deiner Liebe, halt dich fest an deiner Liebe
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest
Halt dich fest, halt dich fest)

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen

Clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end
Clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down
Terrified of being wrong, ultimatum prison cell

Saturn ascends, choose one or ten
Hang on or be humbled again

Humbled again

Clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end
Saturn ascends, comes round again
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten
Ignorant to the damage done

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive these scarlet lettermen

Wear the grudge like a crown
Desperate to control
Unable to forgive and sinking deeper

Defining
Confining
And sinking deeper

Controlling
Defining
And we're sinking deeper

Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Let's you choose what you will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent

Saturn comes back around
Lifts you up like a child or
Drags you down like a stone
To consume you till you choose to let this go
Choose to let this go

Give away the stone
Let the oceans take and trans mutate this cold and fated anchor
Give away the stone
Let the waters kiss and trans mutate these leaden grudges into gold

Let go

I'm sweating, and breathing,
And staring, and thinking,
Sinking deeper.
And it's almost like I'm swimming.

The sun is burning hot again
On the hunter and the fisherman,
And I'm trying to remember when,
But it makes me dizzy.

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
Into a dream within a dream.

Must be the way you whisper.

The sun is setting cool again.
I'm the thinker and the fisherman
And I'm trying to remember when
But it makes me dizzy.

And I'm sweating, and breathing,
And staring, and thinking,
Sinking deeper.
And it's almost like I'm swimming.

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
Into a dream within a dream.

It's the way you whisper.

Drags me under,
It takes me home!

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.

Drags me under,

My compassion is broken now
My will is eroded now
And my desire is broken now
And it makes me feel ugly

I'm on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
So smell my soul is burning

I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy
And I have swallowed the poison you feed me
But I survive on the poisons you feed me
And leavin' guilt fed, hatred fed, weakness fed
And it makes me feel ugly

I'm on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
I'm dead inside

Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up at the bottom

(If I let you, you would make me destroy myself)
(In order to survive you, I must first survive myself)
(I can sink no further, and I cannot forgive you)

(There's no choice but to confront you, to engage you, to erase you)
(I've gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain)
(I will use my mistakes against you, there's no other choice)
(I'm shameless now, I'm nameless now, I'm nothing now, I'm no one now)
(But my soul must be iron 'cause my fear is naked)
(I'm naked and fearless, and my fear is naked)

Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside
Nameless now, shameless now
Nothing now, no one now

Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
As you see me naked now
Fearless now, naked now
Fearless now

Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
It leaves me dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside, dead inside

Hatred keeps me alive
Lowliness keeps me alive
Weakness keeps me alive
Guilt keeps me alive at the bottom

Album  Undertow
What's coming through is alive
What's holding up is a mirror
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn my piss to wine

They're both totally void of hate
But killing me just the same

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again

And I feel this coming over like a storm again
Considerately

Venomous voice, tempts me
Drains me, bleeds me
Leaves me cracked and empty
Drags me down like some sweet gravity

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again

And I feel this coming over like a storm again now
And I feel this coming over like a storm again now

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me

Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me

Without the skin here
Beneath the storm
Under these tears now
The walls came down

And as the snake is drowned
And as I look in his eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times

I could have cried then
I should have cried then

And as the walls come down
And as I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die
It's all right
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

I am too connected to you
Slip away, fade away
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me and
Considerately killing me

Some say the end is near
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon
I certainly hope we will
I sure could use a vacation from this

Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Freaks

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away
Any fucking time. Any fucking day
Learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay

Fret for your figure and
Fret for your latte and
Fret for your lawsuit and
Fret for your hairpiece and
Fret for your Prozac and
Fret for your pilot and
Fret for your contract and
Fret for your car

It's a

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away
Any fucking time. Any fucking day
Learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay

Some say a comet will fall from the sky
Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves
Followed by fault lines that cannot sit still
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits

And some say the end is near
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon
I certainly hope we will
I sure could use a vacation from this

Stupid shit, silly shit, stupid shit

One great big festering neon distraction,
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied

Learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim

Mom's gonna fix it all soon
Mom's comin' 'round to put it back the way it ought to be

Learn to swim

Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and
Fuck all his clones
Fuck all those gun-toting
Hip gangster wannabes

Learn to swim

Fuck retro anything
Fuck your tattoos
Fuck all you junkies and
Fuck your short memory

Learn to swim

Fuck smiley glad-hands
With hidden agendas
Fuck these dysfunctional,
Insecure actresses

Learn to swim

'Cause I'm praying for rain
And I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way
I wanna watch it all go down

Mom, please flush it all away
I wanna see it go right in and down
I wanna watch it go right in
Watch you flush it all away

Time to bring it down again
Don't just call me pessimist
Try and read between the lines

I can't imagine why you wouldn't
Welcome any change, my friend

I wanna see it come down,
Burn it down
Suck it down
Flush it down

Since you're so curious
Well it's anything really
Call it my witching hour
Or what calls to me
But to be serious
Well, it's worse than you think
Should I be ashamed
Because of what I need?

Define right and wrong
In regard to what's going on

Take two
Slip away till the afternoon
It's an easy remedy
For what I just can't do

Over the counter and over the moon
I have my beliefs
This has me confused
But what can I do?

I feel relief in just watching you breathe
It's hypnotizing like an inner peace
I get fixated on your deepest breath
Waiting for the angels to take their effect

Just say the word and I'll be on my way
Regardless of the time, it's just how I was made

To explain, I'm here for a reason so make use of me
I'm hungry and I'm thirsty and I hope you'll be joining
My father is a helper, but my father made mistakes
I see myself in him as I'm a product of his ways
Or maybe I just like the attention

You can stay here tonight, I won't ask any questions
Don't call it polite, it's just a suggestion

Please stay here tonight
Please stay here tonight

I'd be a liar if I said I felt ready for this
I have a past and a poison, that I can admit
But this is what I need to bury the years of debris
To break the circle of the cycles and stop living vicariously
And start living for me

Call it a learning process
And I've never been that quick
Because I take things as they come
And I respond how I see fit
But it's easy to get distracted
As I've been living life abroad
But I'm starved for your acceptance
And I work for your applause

I'd always envisioned myself as a giver
But as I reflect, I've left something to be desired
Not that my heart hasn't ever delivered
But that it's never felt this inspired

To have direction, to feel complete
To embrace affection, to end all the woe is me
But mainly to harbor the love that I have to give
But for tonight, let's just stay inside
Well it's far too loud and I just want quiet
And if we die before we wake
I'll blame it on the past mistakes

Without you, I'm not pure
And without you, I'm not clean
But if I'm going down with you
Then you're going down with me

What I'm afraid of is what is certain and
What I'm sure of is that it's on me
But I'm too tired to be that person
And that person needs to be set free

To harbor the love that I have to give

It's a song of thanks sung by a hack
When the reflection of yourself just won't look back
It's that panic you feel when you don't know what to say
When everyone wants in and you want the subject to change
Because I've been swallowed up and I've been split in two
And I'm not sure which is me and who I respond through

So notify my next of kin
And let them know there's so much more to believe in
It doesn't have to be based on blood
Because the next in line shouldn't have to know what they're made of

This is survived by who held me up
This is survived by who sang the song
And that sense of purpose has made it all worth it

So write a song that everyone can sing along to
So when you're gone, you can live on, they won't forget you

This is survived by a love
This is survived by a cause
That you aren't the only who remembers what it was

This is survived by a love
This is survived by a wish
That you won't let down who has attached themselves to it

This is survived by a love
This is survived by a fear
That all that's left when said and done is words you will never ever hear

I was once asked how I'd like to be remembered
And I simply smiled and said, "I'd rather stay forever"
It was possibly my loudest cliché
But felt better than just walking away

I don't know what my legacy will be
A song, some words I wrote, or a kid I'll never see
All of these things scare me half to death
I'll suffer the day just hoping for the best

But that's not to say I don't think that all of this can change
But that's not to say I won't wake up some day
With a lion's pride that I'm gonna be okay

If again I'm asked how I'd like to be remembered
Next time I'll be better prepared for the answer
But you'll never know much of the truth
So I'll just exist, it's all I can do

So much to consider and too much to grasp
To swallow mortality is enough of a task
And leaving your mark is just too much to ask
I'll just bow my head and leave out the back

It's the early signs of disintegration
The back and forth from a new machine
It's been blessed and burned into a formation
By a wish dipped in kerosene

So who's gonna light the fuse?
Who's going to be the one
To hold high the flame
Because I refuse

And I've just begun
So don't hold me down, I'm almost done
A lesson lived through the loss of love
This is not a search for who's at fault
It's more of a plea for hope and understanding

It's the side effects of adoration
The come and go and get out clean
I've been cursed and freed from dedication
By a wish dipped in kerosene

So who's gonna light the fuse?
Who's gonna be the one
Because I refuse

Every moment can't remain
And every life won't stay the same
With time comes a layer of rust
And our bones will turn to dust
Everyone will fall away
And every season is built on change
With time, the paint will peel
And all sense will lose its feel
Every cloth will start to fray
And every night will become day
With time, a mold will form
And what's cold can become warm
Every love can't always stay
And the dead will soon decay
With time, we'll all be gone
But how you lived can live on

Every moment can't remain
And every life won't stay the same
With time comes a layer of rust
And our bones will turn to dust

It's not for nothing, but I've seen a transformation
Like I consider my happiness for the first time in ages
And you might say I'm off, but it's the first time I'm feeling on

Don't worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations

And most people I know, I've used as camouflage
I've circled myself with pretty people to hide who I was
And I won't miss them and they won't miss me

I'll tie in those loose ends
A string is just the thread to separation
And I'll retire these old clothes
To brace for a wardrobe that no one knows

Don't worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations
But it's those instances I have used to ground me on occasion
Don't worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations

Over and under
I'll dissolve and use charm as my cover
Left over right
Walk a careful line between you and the outside

There is confidence and delusion
I reside between that confusion
It's a misstep down a black hole
It's a long way down and a mouthful

So overcome and become one
So over...

Over and under
We learn to grow and we learn to recover
Over and out
I'll play the card that holds me in less doubt

There's promiscuity and devotion
And only one fulfills an emotion
It's a big step to end a yearning
It's accepting love but I'm learning

To overcome and become one
So overcome and become one

I'll find my way
And follow through
And maybe there

You can call this coming clean
Or the repeat of what you know
About the struggles I once had
As I'm learning to let go

I made a pledge to myself
If I was to raise my voice
To be direct as I can be
No matter what I may destroy
But I can't say I haven't aged
I've outgrown what I used to be
I won't fake what is expected
To succeed with album three (That's not me)

Does this mean that the words won't come?
Does this mean that I'm at my end?
If my joy comes with the price of my love
I won't pay if I have to pretend
There's always a chance to relapse and fall back
To the person I still fear is there
So if this ink will suddenly run out
I'll refill if I feel the need to share

It was the fall of last year in New York City
Day two of a tour, when my friend Johnny said
"Hey, I'd like you to meet Andy"
We got to talking and connected on some things
Mutual friends and how his band started writing
But then something was spoke
I knew exactly what he meant
I understood when he said
"It's hard to write content"

And it still is, and it still is
But I won't take a step back
Though it might be for the best
And it still is, and it still is

I know you asked for some advice
They use your blood to capitalize
So give up all your secrets
To move units, display your weakness
You might spend some years alone
At the price of forgetting your home
So expose what hurts you the worst
The exchange deals a handsome return (Are you in?)

What have I seen other than what the bottom looks like?
Stuck somewhere between the gloom and the light
When you're working towards building back those broken boards
You sometimes lose your footing
You often find yourself putting off everyone while finding comfort in other songs
To distract the fact that you're actually disappearing
I have no excuses that I can offer
Just the hope that your forgiveness will hold back the water
For what its worth...; I'm sorry
And at the end I swear I'm trying.

Retracing my steps in hopes to find
Some part of me that may be somewhere left behind
There's a fear, there's a point, there is a problem
What if what I find won't solve any of them
And I wonder why I have no motivation
I guess I just answered my own question
I'm not the golden boy so don't shine me on
I'm the bastard son of romantic babylon
With veins that are all fashioned out of copper
A past design not destined to be concurred
But like anything there is a flaw inscripted deep
That may explain everything

A fork in all my one way roads
I just sit to see what happens

I admit I'm scared
So fragile, emotionally impaired (hopeless)
Damaged goods
So broken, so misunderstood
(wreckless and careless)
And I can see
That rain cloud that follows me
Looks like the one that follows you
And the same ghosts that keep me awake haunt your nights just the same
All dressed up in black and grey
We know each other just the same
And every mile that sits between
Won't understand what it means
To have one look mean everything
And throw all caution to the sea
I have faith in us if we don't self destruct

Have you ever wondered why I always drive alone?
Same reasons why I never pick up my phone
I got these issues that you can't subscribe
And I'm scared to talk to anyone for what they might prescribe

These days I just try to keep to myself
Well aware I've lost touch with everyone else
I understand that I'm fading away
I'd rather play dead than play catch up
Because no one really cares all that much
I can't keep having the same conversations
I look to the floor to keep concentration
Focused hard on every single word
My nails are dug deep and my stomach hurts
I am selfish it seems, but I'm trying my best to breathe
Hoping you don't notice as I keep laughing

Because it hurts to be missed and no one is deserving this
With my back to a hardwood floor
I understand that I'm not a provider but a center divider
I got lanes to explain the different ways I behave
A life thats a detour to where I am not sure
But if the sun is in my eyes I think I'm doing the right thing
I rely on exit signs, and destination times
And this drive that knows me better than I think I know myself
With that being said I won't play pretend
That I'm not growing up, that I'm not giving in
Late nights and all night drives are the reason why I'm alive
And I'm not going anywhere

Now will you take your seats, and be quiet please

This is my final act so may I have your full attention
And for my final trick I'll make everyone who loves me disappear

Stress, catch my breath

Get some rest (XXX there'll be a new tale of)
From the mess (He and I)
Couldn't care less (In fact any time, every day)
Sugar cane (Write fictional stories)
Is like smack to my vein
Shook flame (If you want to)
But I don't complain (On the street, in your home)

I believe in different reasons
I believe in breakthrough seasons
I believe when snow flakes fall
I believe in buildings tall

I believe in people bombing
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that's why I'm running

Keep living
Keep living

You've gotta ask (There'll be a new tale)
Before he attacks (Of he and I)
You've got the flats (In fact any time)
Dub my sacks (Every day)
You've got the city (Writing fictional stories)
Move out of the country
I'm scrunching (If you want to)
Friends that are punchy (On the street, in your home)

I believe in people falling
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that's why I'm running

I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being

Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living

I'm wearing thin, wearing out, becoming weak
Holding hands with this rope
She's my self-destructive bleeding disease
The things that makes it hard to breathe
But if I shoved you far away
This addict just starved again, asphyxiated

And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

Lynched high above what used to be
In her gallows built for me
So I escaped; cut this noose around my neck

I break free to see the things you blinded me
And I shoved you far away
Now I live the life I dreamed of
You're dead to me

And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

You poisoned my life
So I take this knife
And I cut you out
Cut you out

And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

Set me free...set me free

A chasm grows
In the cavity of serpentine teeth
Hunger pangs strike
For the sweet feast of innocent blood
Of innocent bloodshed
Now here we go

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

The gaping wounds
Hemorrhaging the blood from which they feast
Eat us alive
Consume to feed a hunger with no
A hunger with no end
Let's fucking go

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

This battle's not the same which they have led us to believe
A synthesis of propaganda, terror and deceit
We are the cattle; they the slaughter; our meat: gasoline

They pump us through the machine's valves to cleanse the world's "disease"
We are the ammunition that will cause all life to cease

Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust down from the sky

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust down from the sky

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Langsam hebt und senkt sich
der Brustkorb und sie schnarcht
selig und zufrieden mit dem Tag
Dein Blick fällt auf die Schuhe
und dann fällt dir noch ein
Da vorne quiekt ein Sparschwein und
du sitzt hier fast allein
Vielleicht tut es doch weh

Dein Onkel hat gut lachen
hat man stets gesagt
Er machte ein Vermögen
mit Chemie
Vielleicht macht das nicht glücklich
doch beruhigt einen umgemein
Und wenn es einen zur Ruhe hilft
dann muss es richtig sein

Vielleicht tut es doch weh
Und dann packt dich
die Angst
Manchmal glaubt man beinahe selbst
dass das alles
so gehört
Vielleicht tut es doch weh
und nimmt dir
den Schlaf...

Dem Nachbar blieb die Sorge
Er süffelt sich in Schlaf
Da ist das Zetern halb so lang
Du schaust auf deren Autos
Die schlucken ähnlich viel
Und wenn du immer fleissig bist
dann fahren sie dich
zum Ziel...

Erinnere dich
was hatte man dir
alles schon erzählt
Vielleicht fehlt ja deinen Leuten
eine Schulter wie ein Tier
Warum denn an dir zweifeln?
Sie sind doch alle hier!

Doch es tut gar nicht
weh!
Und dann geht auch die Angst
Manchmal sollte man
nicht glauben
dass das
alles
so
gehört...

Artist  Turbostaat
Album  Kein Mensch ist Illegal
Es ist ein nettes Haus
nur für euch allein
und die Karre davor
noch nicht mal gebraucht
Und der grösste Teil ist auch noch gespart
Zum Glück würde einer töten
für ein kleines
bisschen
Geld

Und du siehst dir Orte an
die niemand vor dir sah
am Ende regnet's
dann

Voran! Voran!

Und dann im Februar
auf dem Weg nach Kandahar
liegst du zitternd auf dem Boden
während Andere ins Kino gehen

Es hiess noch Riesenchance
Als der Sommer kam
Niemand wollte dich zur Lehre
und auch etwas besser zahlen
Man zeigt hinauf
Niemals auf das Geld
Den Präsident zur Seite
denn der Schuss kam nicht von ihm

Am Ende war es leise
So selten der Geruch
Ein Affentod der Jugend
und die Fragen bleiben doch

War es das Elternhaus
oder gar dein Kopf
oder die Gottverdammte Lehre
in 'nem viel zu kalten Herz
Wer weiss das schon
Alle schweigen mit
Das Hängen ihrer Köpfe
ist die Antwort auf dein Schmerz

Wir ziehen
weiter als der Sieg
Er ist kein Ende für den Krieg
Das ist kein Ende
Das ist kein Ende

Am Ende einer Reise
Schaust du dich nochmal um
Und wählst ganz einfach aus
Was in deine Tasche passt
Oder ist etwas zu schwer
Was passt da eigentlich rein

Das Meer kennt seinen Weg
Denn es war schon immer hier
Das Meer kennt seinen Weg
Und kehrt zurück zu dir

Am Ende einer Reise
Hängst du noch einmal nach
Den Gedanken an die Zeit
An Liebe in der Fremde
Die zu Hause nicht hinpasst
Und dein Geheimnis bleibt

Das Meer kennt seinen Weg
Denn es war schon immer hier
Das Meer kennt seinen Weg
Und kehrt zurück zu dir

Am Ende einer Reise
Kommst du in deine Welt
Und lehnst dich ruhig zurück
Du hast ja noch ne zweite
In die du gehen kannst
Wenn es hier nicht weitergeht

Das Meer kennt seinen Weg
Denn es war schon immer hier
Das Meer kennt seinen Weg
Und kehrt zurück zu dir

Schreibmaschinen brennen
Stifte laufen aus
Der Rhythmus
Gestört
Und die Spinner auf der Straße
Bleiben heute mal egal
Der Airbag
Ging so schnell auf wie der Schnaps

Wenn Telefone klingeln
Tut es allen leid
Keiner
Konnte etwas für ihn tun
Momente bleiben eingepackt
Er macht die Heizung aus
Das Ticket
Für den Zug ist schon bestellt

Und er wartet
Sekunden
Gar Stunden
Ein Jahr

Und der Nachtisch
Voller Bilder
Viel zu blau
Viel zu grün
Viel zu grell und viel zu hell
Und der Nachtisch
Voller Bilder
Viel zu blau
Viel zu grün
Viel zu grell und viel zu hell

Strophe drei, die seh ich schon schneller
Erst die Bilder, dann das Glas
Entscheidende Sekunden
Schnell verpasst
IG Rock läuft grad im Fernsehen
Darauf schnell noch einen Schnaps
Und das Lachen
Wird dann morgen nachgeholt

Und er wartet

Gar Stunden

Haben sie Beweise?
Oder einen Verdacht?
Ich kann mir nicht sicher sein
Ich kann mir nicht sicher sein

Erster Sommertag
Und wohl der schönste im Jahr
Da fand man ihn hier aufgeschlitzt
Im Garten
Alle Vögel schwiegen
Voller Ehrfurcht geduckt
Und seine Mutter schwieg für immer
Und alle machten mit

Wenn der Fleck dich stören wird
Schau weg, schau weg
Haben Sie etwas gesehen?
Hat hier irgendjemand was gesehen?
Wenn der Fleck dich stören wird
Schau weg, schau weg
Haben Sie etwas gesehen?
Hat hier irgendjemand was gesehen?

Pappeln hielten still!
Autos blieben stehen
'ne Sekunde ewig lang und ruhig
zu jung
viel zu jung
Sieben Jahre,
Die nun Mythos werden
Gezählt

Wenn der Fleck dich stören wird
Schau weg, schau weg
Haben Sie etwas gesehen?
Hat hier irgendjemand was gesehen?
Wenn der Fleck dich stören wird
Schau weg, schau weg
Haben Sie etwas gesehen?
Hat hier irgendjemand was gesehen?

Alles liegt in Frieden
Alles aufgeblüht
Nach einem endlos kalten Winter
Der alles weiß begrub
Haben sie Beweise?
Oder einen Verdacht?
Ich kann mir nicht sicher sein!

Gibt es Verletzte

Zusammen mit der Hoffnung
Fällt Sonne in die Stadt
Es geht noch immer weiter
Zumindestens bergab
Sie verlassen ihre Gräben
Die sie zurzeit bewohnen
Sind wir nicht weit gekommen?
Frag der erste schon

Und sie beladen ihre Autos
Mit Kindern und Gepäck
Wohin soll bloß die Reise gehen?
Am besten ganz weit weg
Sie begraben ihre Toten
Und schauen dich groß an
Was gibt es hier denn noch zu tun?
Am besten weiterfahren!

Und sie bleiben
Ohne Fragen
Weil alles andere scheinbar besser ist
Und deine Augen starren weiter
Auf Fischer
Auf den Hafen
Und den Wind

Köpfe rollen zusammen
Und denken lauthals nach
Ob wir denn noch zu retten wären
Mit einem starken Staat?
Wer soll uns noch führen?
Ob er noch beten kann?
Liebt er seine Kinder?
Ein guter Ehemann

Und sie bleiben
Ohne Fragen
Weil alles andere scheinbar besser ist
Und deine Augen starren weiter
Auf Fischer

Da draußen läuft ein Hund mit 'ner Familie
Man sieht sie kilometerweit entfernt
Wie soll das gehen?
Ja, sagen Sie mal!
Weit und breit kein Plätzchen, das dich schützt

Der Pöbel schreit und wartet auf sein Futter
Das er immer wie durch Geisterhand bekommt
Wir brauchen das! Wir brauchen das!
Also lass die letzten Opfer brennen

Schau dir nur mal an was du hier machst

Say, say my playmate
Won't you lay your hands on me?
Mirror my malady
Transfer my tragedy

Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish

My mind's aflame
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
Before the transformation takes
And blood lust tanks and crave gets slaked

My mind has changed
My body's frame, but God I like it
My heart's aflame
My body's strained but God I like it

My mind has changed
My body's frame, but God I like it
My heart's aflame
My body's strained but God I like it

Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that will blow your Mongrel mind

Baby doll I recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind it's
You, you, you, you

I know its strange, another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go, so let me show you
I know its strange, another way to get to know you
We've got to move, here comes the moon
So let it show you, show you now

Dream me, oh dreamer
Down to the floor
Open my hands and let them
Weave onto yours

Feel me, completer
Down to my core
Open my heart and let it
Bleed onto yours

Feeding on fever
Down on all fours
Show you what all the
Howlin's for

Hey, hey my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot (here), hot (here), hot (here), hot (here)

Got a curse we cannot lift (We're howling forever)
Shines when the sunshine shifts (We're howling forever)
There's a cure comes with a kiss
The bite that binds the gift that gives (We're howling forever)

Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood (We're howling forever)
Tell your gra'ma and your mama too
It's true, true, true, true
(We're howling forever, oh oh)
(We're howling forever, oh oh)
(We're howling forever, oh oh)
(We're howling forever, oh oh)

Don't know what's inside of me.

Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping,
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping,
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no,
You are all that I've got, no.

Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system,
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted,
I want the markings made on my skin,
To mean something to me again,

And repeat yesterday's dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio

There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' 'em out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm

Can you save, can you save my

Can you save, can you save my

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly
I won't let the wind go quietly

Be the one, be the one
To take my soul and make it undone
Be the one, be the one
To take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know
You can bring the fire, I can bring the bones
I know, I know
You make the fire and my bones will make it grow

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly
I won't let the wind go quietly

Put away, put away
All the gods your father served today
Put away, put away
Your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know
How to put back the power in our soul
We don't know, we don't know
Where to find what once was in our bones

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway, if it was our way
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playing shows

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

(They be alive tomorrow?)
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat in a gas mask
If you ask Zack, he's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists
And no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary
Forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry

All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

But will they be alive tomorrow?
But will they be alive tomorrow?
But will they be alive tomorrow?
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to

A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise
And who I am today is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present

Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it, for others to use it
You're dead, 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?

Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common motivation
To promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment, but you and I know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead

Release me from the present
I'm obsessin' all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man

I don't know why, I just feel I'm better off,
Staying in the same room I was born in,
I look outside, and see a whole world better off,
Without me in it trying to transform it,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Listen, I know this one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds,
But the lyrics are so down,
It's ok though, because it represents, wait better yet, it is,
Who I feel I am right now,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Heard you say, "not today, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "there's no choice, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,

Don't you test me though, just because I play the piano,
Doesn't mean I am not willing to take you down, I'm sorry

I'm out of my mind, I'm not seeing things right,
I waste all this time trying to run from you,
But I'm out of my mind.

Heard you say, "not today, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "there's no choice, "
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,

You waste all this time trying to get to me,

Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you
All our feelings tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love

Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out

Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating em, splitting em up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you, that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do

I'd live for you, and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming
Like who would you live for, who would you die for
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home-grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

When the leader of the bad guys sang,
Something soft and soaked in pain,
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway,
He must've forgot to close his door,
As he cranked out those dismal chords,
And his four walls declared him insane.

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please, take me.

Na na na na, oh oh

Three lights are lit but the fourth one's out,
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout,
I forgot about the drought of lightbulbs in this house,
So I head out, down a route I think is heading south,

But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt,
And now that my mind's out, and now I hear it clear and loud,
I'm thinking, "wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house."

I found my way,

We don't believe what's on TV,
Because it's what we want to see,
And what we want, we know we can't believe,
We have all learned to kill our dreams.

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here,
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds,
And we'll make money selling your hair.

I don't care what's in your hair,
I just want to know what's on your mind,
I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, "
But because of you I might think twice.

Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen,
Would I just change what I've told my friends,
I don't want to know who I would be,
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep.

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside

It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me
Of who I killed
Inside my dream
I hate this car
That I'm driving
There's no hiding for me

I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence


I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work, there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace we'll win, and fear we'll lose

And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence


And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit...;

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit...;

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

So often I ought
To replace that slot

I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places, fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times... I have committed

Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing

What kids are doing, are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them, then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free

Yeah, am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay

Fake you out
I'll fake you out

Of what you have to say

I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone

And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know
What that means, I know

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat

But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then, you'll never understand

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it
Don't take it, take it, take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

We've turned our hands to guns
Trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you
Of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers
To my head

The solution is
I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest
And this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them
To turn their guns to a fist

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

I'm taking over my body
Back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
"T"s uncrossed and "I"s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot
Like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, swat

I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life
You should take my soul

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

And I'll be holding on to you
And I'll be holding on to you

Remember the moment
You know exactly where you're going
'Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me"

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith

Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith

Entertain my faith
Entertain my faith

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

Let's say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside-down
We'll make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after, happily

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone, lone, lone

I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always
Be better than Sundays 'cause Sundays are my suicide days

I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depress...;

...;ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green, gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees

Freeze frame please, let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora's Box's contents look nonviolent

Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind's shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could
Find, I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions

They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you got to kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

Made it this far
Made it this

I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up
Up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding

I'm pleading please, oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this?
Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one
Who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

On the eve of a day
That's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await
And clouds anticipate
The start of a day
When we put on our face
A mask that portrays
That we don't need grace

On the eve of a day
That is bigger than us
But we open our eyes
'Cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms
And the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling
There's something we need

I'm not free
I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you what I'm sing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore
And that's denial number four

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them
I'll tell them
I'll tell them

You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?

I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
'Cause you're the only one who knows it
Yeah, you're the only one who knows it

And I will hide behind my pride
Don't know why I think I can lie
'Cause there's a screen on my chest
Yeah there's a screen on my chest

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I can't see past my own nose
I'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground
Just like a vertical locomotive, that's a train
Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane

My flow's not great, okay
I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine
There's some people and I
Who have a really tough time
Getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm standing in front of you

Night falls with gravity
The earth turns from sanity
Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lie; his name is Hope

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near

When the sun is coming, window soothes
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun make the hills its grave

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside my mind

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live, yeah yeah yeah

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers; schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah, I'll live on

By the time the night wears off
The dust is down and shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the night's return

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up inside my mind

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble

And boy, I found her

She's in love with herself
She likes the dark
On her milk-white neck
The Devil's mark

Now it's All Hallows' Eve
The moon is full
But will she trick or treat?
I bet she will

She will
(Happy Halloween, baby)

She's got a date at midnight
With Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lily Munster
Ain't got nothing on you

Well, when I called her evil
She just laughed
Well, cast that spell on me
Boo bitch-craft

Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black

Black, black, black, black number one
Black, black, black, black number one

Little wolf-skin boots
And clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral
For which she's dressed

Her perfume smells like
Burning leaves
Every day
Is Halloween

No more nights of blood and fire
No more nights of blood and fire

Yeah I always thought we'd be together
And that our love could not be better
Well, with no warning you were gone
I still don't know what went wrong

(You don't know what I've been through)
(Just want to put my love in you)

No more nights of blood and fire
No more nights of blood and fire

All those special memories
Now I bleed for you - burn for me
Perhaps I was just dreaming
When I think these things had real meaning

(You don't know what I've been through)
(Just want to put my love in you)

Love eternal
Lust infernal
Bleeding, burning
Needing, yearning

Ma chéri, you remain a mystery to me
I see your face in every flame
With no answers, I have only myself to blame
Of all the women that I have known - they're not you
I'd rather be alone

No more nights of blood and fire
No more nights of blood and fire

No more nights of blood
No more nights of fire!

Forgive her for she knows not what she does

A cross upon her bedroom wall
From grace she will fall
An image burning in her mind
And between her thighs

A dying god-man full of pain
When will you cum again?
Before him beg to serve or please
On your back or knees

No forgiveness for her sins
Prefers punishment
Would you suffer eternally
Or internally?

Ah

For her lust she'll burn in hell
Her soul done medium well
All through mass manual stimulation
Salvation

Like a flash of light in an endless night
Life is trapped between two black entities
'Cause when you trust someone, illusion has begun
No way to prepare, impending despair

(is there?)

Did one say so cruel: "Tis better to love than lose"
Ignorance is bliss - wish not knew your kiss
So many times been burned, this lesson goes unlearned
Remember desire only fuels the fire - liar

(liar)

Betwixt birth and death, every breath regrets
I pity the living, envy for the dead
Emotionally stunned, in defense I'm numb
I'd rather not care than to be aware - be scared

I don't need love
I don't need love

I don't need love
I don't need love

Are a thousand tears worth a single smile?
When you give an inch, will they take a mile?
Longing for the past but dreading the future
If not being used, well then you're a user and a loser, ah

World renowned failure at both death and life
Given nothingness, purgatory blight
To run and hide, a cowardly procedure
Options exhausted, except for anesthesia, anesthesia, ah

I don't feel anything, anything
I don't feel anything, anything

I don't feel anything, anything
I don't feel anything, anything, anything, anything, no

What is the link between these crafts?
Doctors and thieves,
They both wear masks
Overpaid meat magicians

Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

Your doctorate and PhD
Would wipe my ass
Etched in feces
Will not cure your affliction

Doctors Jeckyll or Mengele
And your face too,
They're just a blur
Can't improve my condition

Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

Appointment made, waited three hours
Did not realize
You had such power
I'd rather see a mortician

Your parents saved or had the bucks
Your education stems from luck
Future corpse:
Death by physician

I have no choice: devoid of rights
So pull the plug, it's my damned life
Keep me alive to increase your bill
A Red Cross hell? - the hospital!

Just let me die
With dignity
It's not suicide,
Simply mercy

Just who do you think you are?
Medical school don't make you God
Now I don't care what you've been taught
Just get me off this life support

Just let me die
With dignity
It's not suicide,
Simply mercy

Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

I said
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

I said
Life is killing me, life is killing me
Life is killing me

Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

In the dark bathed in Cathode ray blue
Miss Red Hook of 1922
Weeping silently for the pain of others

Every night a tearful rosary
A victim of the curse of empathy
Her reward for compassion is to suffer

Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

My shortcomings, I know, caused her grief
Still she loves me, this I can't believe!
Responding not with anger but a prayer

Heaven's just Southwest of Cobble Hill
True, I am the son of an Angel
Maternally not one woman compares

Nettie (Nettie),
No need to cry (to cry)
Let me (let me)
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

(If you fall, I will catch you)
(When you're lost, I'll be there soon)
(Far away, but of course near)
(When you're sad, I'm always here)

Thank you for saving me from myself
Your compassion became its own hell
Unequivocally beautiful inside and out
Without a doubt

Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

Nettie (Nettie),
No need to cry (to cry)
Let me (let me)
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

Let me...

In her place one hundred candles burning
As salty sweat drips from her breast
Her hips move and I can feel what they're saying, swaying
They say: "the beast inside of me's gonna get ya, get ya, get..."

Yea...

Black lipstick stains her glass of red wine
I am your servant, may I light your cigarette?
Those lips smooth, yeah I can feel what you're saying, praying
They say: "the beast inside of me's gonna get ya, get ya, get..."

Yea...

I beg to serve, your wish is my law
Now close those eyes and let me love you to death
Shall I prove? I mean what I'm saying, begging
I say: "the beast inside me's gonna get ya, get ya, get..."

Ah, let me love you, too
Ah, let me love you to death
To death

Ah, let me love you, too
Ah, let me love you to death

Stuck together

In their '62 'vette
Sharing one cigarette,
In a black light trance then
Go go dance

Then.

Go go trance

Then...

They keep me warm on cold nights
We must be quite a sight,
In our meat triangle
All tangled

Wow

My girlfriend's girlfriend
She looks like you
My girlfriend's girlfriend
She's my girl too

Her and me and her and she and me
An uncrowded couple,
Are we three?

Hey, we don't care what people say,
When walking hand in hand down Kings Highway
Two for one today

Seems three years, though maybe four
Someone drops dead whom I adore
You love someone, there will be grief
The kiss of death, lips of a thief

Goddamnit!

A dusty stack of photographs
Of times I cried, but mostly laughed
Commit the past into blue flame
Acrid smoke cowardly shame

Goddamnit!

At times I'm truly terrified
'Cause dope and booze don't help to hide
They used to mask a weakling's hurt
It's just like painting over dirt

Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead

(All dead)

Life's a game I cannot win
Both good and bad must surely end
The mirrors always tell the truth
I love myself for hating you

Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead

Goddamnit!

Goddamnit!

All dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead, all dead

Maybe we, why don't we
Sit right here for half an hour?
We'll speak of what a waste I am
And how we missed your beat again

I swear we need to find some comfort
In this run-down place
To bridge the gap of this
Concious state that we live in
And I'm short on time

How come you try to place us all
To fit the shape of
And I break what they tell you
You to move on
But mostly what they show you (Move on)

At this rate, we can't give up
I'm takin' back all the things I've said
I'm takin' back all the things I've said
But I sure can't just sit still
Keep me filled in and I swear I'll come

We walk alone, we walk alone
We walk alone, we walk alone
We walk alone, we walk alone
Back home alone
Back home

You're almost gone and I'm okay
I still see your shadow
To give you time to be afraid
But never your face
Again I remember
Your presence

I hope to God you come down
I hope to God you feel this now
I hope to God you come down
I hope to God

I know there must be some way out of here
And all of them will be waiting there

And the one whose in charge
I've lead us all astray again

Oh, how the plot thickens!

We always assume the worst

I'm afraid no ones listening anymore
I'm freaking out
I'm so sick

Don't look down

The only thing in my way is myself
I'm just thinking out loud
I'm just thinking
How can I still be alive
I shoulda been gone so long, so long ago

I can't get away from it all
I messed up like I always do
I gave you nothing
I took you nowhere
You're still listening

Has taken a turn for the worst

Something else talkin' in my ear
Someone save me
When I speak, it begins to decay
I'm not about to bury myself
Oh God, my hands are shaking again
Calm down

Takes it's toll on me

Oh I'm in over my head again
Reach in and grab a hold of me
I'm so scared that I've started to slip.
They say that I'll never change
I'll prove 'em wrong

Sometimes
When I feel down
It seems so
Like I'm insane
And it looks like a never-ending hole

Then I can't feel
Anything, no
Everything is
Meaningless
Day after day my time slips away

When I drop me
When I've lost myself
No one sees me
But I need that
And the sticky hole sucks me in

I feel lifeless
Something drives me
I'm controlled by threads
Connected to my hands and feet

And I will fly
Away from my fears
And I will fly
To find myself

But I'm routined
So I stand up
And I change place
Search new ways
But my thoughts go round in circles

When I go out
Get in contact
When I feel you
When you see me
Piece by piece my life returns

And I will fly
Away from my fears

And I will fly
Away from my fears
And I will fly
To find myself

And I will fly
Away from my fears

Wasn't it a tranquil place I left?
I am trustful.
For nothing I can grip with my hands,
But for a new chance.

Wasn't it the false friends I believed in,
I spent my time for?
I always waited for affection,
For some friendly words.

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

How many disappointments can I stand
Before I resignate?
When things that once were charming
Get an ugly face.

Can I keep my favourite things alive,
The places I like the most?
I won't be careless with myself,
I will protect my dreams.

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?

No one has reached me
'Cause the way is just too long
I have a thousand names
And I know many tricks
To dissapear when you get too close

You wanna find me
But you can't blind me
I will tell you something
You already know
Don't be disappointed
If your mission fails this time

Coming in loud and clear

It's time for me to start
I have to reach the other shore
Before the day will rise
I have to choose a single name
Leave the past behind and change the facts

If I won't start now, I will never do
I walk on frozen ground
My feet are losing contact
It is uncertain
I hope I will arrive
I'm going on into your direction

Coming in loud and clear

Where intelligence is slaved to money
We've accepted our thoughtlessness
Not to see our imperfection
We want more and more and more
We populate the Earth like cancer
We see all that, grin and bear it
But can't stop killing

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Dusty ruins - witnesses of our past
Our eyes look back through a veil of ashes
How will our future look?
Radioactive landscapes?
Mutated beings crawling on our way?
Where are we going?
Where is the escape?

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Duck tape that mechanical eye
When it's blind it can't tell whether truth is a lie
Used a sewer 'cause the street's are not safe
And don't tell anyone that you're tryin' to escape
And don't make a sound while you are runnin' away
'cause desertion is not looked upon mildly these days

Duck for the camera lens
Hush for the microphone
Do whatever you can where you are
To change all the things that are wrong with this place

And we can leave if that's what it takes
To make us feel good, to make us feel safe
But maybe runnin' is the easy way out
We could fight for the right ways, fight for our birthplace
And we should not let these people forget what they've done
'cause they fed us lies and made us fear everyone

Throw my heart against your walls

Insanity kicks in and all I see is another dead end
So close your eyes and escape from what you hide

How long will I take to bleed, there's no saving me
How far will you go to hold on

I'm better off cutting my own throat, in hope for once that you might hear me

Alone I've gone through hell and back to try to fell

We'll raise the flag of discontent,
We know who we are and where we stand,
I know words can't change the world
But they can have an impact on life
Through some words that someone else wrote
I found hope, and hope is all we have.
Why sing another empty anthem?
When you know this world needs direction.

Hope is all we have. the hollow words you say
We both know they mean nothing
We know that your heart is hollow
We know that your words are shallow

I am a monster inside a man
The outer shell is my better half
Methods of madness have no end
When you hunt the dead
An urge, strong urge I can't resist
And they will only set me free to run again
I am a wolf a killer alone I stand
All you see is my mask of sanity, a true mistery
The wolf will strike again
My dreams will prey on you
I promise this will set you free

Close your eyes and wait for it
The warm crimson freedom
Will wash you clean
Your body will rot beneath the concrete
I am a wolf a killer alone I stand
All you see is my mask of sanity a true mistery
The wolf will strike again

Fuck the American Dream
I know it all too well, I've watched my whole life
I've felt those calloused hands and looked into those broken eyes
One more bleeding heart that will never see its time
You suffer to survive, it will bury you alive

Fuck this place, burn it down. Everything I've loved is gone
This is not my home, I've played my final song
Tear us down, free us all

Sell your soul for something meaningless
A slow death for the corporate mess, and we call this happiness
What are we left with in the end? Defeat
A lifetime of obedience kicking in your teeth

Fuck this place, burn it down. Everything I've loved is gone
This is not my home, I've played my final song
Tear us down, free us all

We were sold a promise of a better tomorrow
Fuck the American Dream
We were told that our choices were our own
Fuck the American Dream
Promised the opportunity of a lifetime
Fuck the American Dream
Deceived we could be all we can be
Fuck the American Dream

Über Berg und Tal werden wir geh'n und alle Gefahren auf uns neh'm.
Denn Angst kennen wir nicht.
Auf der Suche nach unserem Licht.
Wo mag das Licht bloß sein?
Wir finden's nicht oh nein!
Vielleicht liegt's noch in unser'n Zimmern?
Denkt nach Glühwürmchen.
Ihr müsst euch erinnern.
Oh Glühwürmchen, mir wird es jetzt klar.
Wir können das Licht nicht finden, weil es nie da war.
Denkt doch mal nach!
Wir leben doch in Afrika und sind keine Glühwürmchen sondern Nashörner.
Wir sind Nashörner.
Lasst den Kopf nicht hängen.
Kein Grund, heut zu verzagen.

Wir können Blumen pflanzen und schöne Lieder singen und wild im Kreise tanzen.

We were designed for more.
In an image not our own.
But we've fallen short.
I'm quite speechless and was quite unaware.
Of what the capabilities of a weak heart are.
We're cast away.
It'll run through the back of your head until you regain control again.
The sleep lost on these thoughts wasn't worth the time.
We're cast away until we regain control again.
This year of you held near or not at all.
It wasn't worth the wait.
We're all cast away.
We were designed for more.
In an image not our own.
But we've fallen short.
We were so close.
It's just not worth it to stay in this state.
It's just not worth it to keep it.
It's just not worth it to let it go.
I believe in a better condition.
In one that I have yet to attain.
I believe in a better love.
In one that has yet to change.
The love that I feel from my brothers is the sun in the sky.
I will find my condition in that which is unconditional.
Conversation.
Ours are never, you are ever so convincing they'll get better.
It's just not worth it to stay in this state.
I believe in a better condition.
In one I have yet to attain.
I believe in a better love.
In one that has yet to change.
Fill me with faith.
I won't be cast away.

We've planted a seed, an ever growing wonder to a beautiful tree. Grow.
Each branch outstretched and different from the last.
Where the old have broken, some easier than the last.
The right ones have grown in to fill in the gaps.
And all are equal in love and trust.
And all are a part of something so much bigger than this.
Through the trials our tongues are tied, to trying times, so many unsaid lines.
Our lives were over at so many moments, so many.
And now they're all just beginning.
I have never been so consumed and I have never loved it more.
To be devoted to letting all see what it is to live in the love of others.
To live in the love of my brothers.
And spilling back all that anyone has ever spilled for me.
To show that to those who have never seen.
Four years ago we planted a seed.
Found that foundation that we need.
Strived for the perfect balence, to show love and show compassion.
And our vision for this world will not die when we are dead.
My future started with the first note that I ever played.
The first note that was ever sang.
When we started living with purpose and writing with meaning.
This is what we were made for.
Every day I live this future.

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And she's long gone when she's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, she'll never see you cry
Pretend she doesn't know that she's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

She was long gone when she met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or him or anyone or anything
Yeah...

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?

I can run

So let your fire burn
Oh, your flame will be lit

And there's nothing left

You can become selfless
You're not set in stone

You will wade through mistakes that we all make

Why do we love only when it's convenient to us?
Why do we love only when it's convenient to us?

It is because we don't want to let go
Of the security that a close heart holds?
Or is it the risk of being broken?
Too unbearable to even let the thought surface.

There are greater rewards in stepping outside of your own comfort
That there are in never breaking down the walls that you've built.

A solely self-sustaining life is surely a hollow one
Why do we love only when it's convenient to us?

Why are we understanding only when it's agreeable?

It is because we don't want to let go
Of the security that a close heart holds?
Or is it the risk of being broken?

A solely self-sustaining life is surely a hollow one

It's time to prove that we aren't all talk

I've died inside every time I tried
to lie to myself about feeling alive, alive.
to lie to myself about feeling alive, alive.
I've died.

All the lights,
Were too bright to see the spark that I've been missing for too long.
Something I've been missing for too long.

All these distractions, kept me from seeing what I needed all along, an understanding.

I am speechless tonight
As I stare into the sky.
I feel endless compassion, forgiveness, and love,
I feel everyone who is looking up sharing this,
I feel unexplainably alive.

I need to understand what we've grown to be.

Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive.
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive.
So sing with me if you feel this feeling.
So sing with me if you feel this feeling.
I'm alive.

Don't catch me at the wrong time
Or you will feel my wrath
The one I wished I never had.

I need to rid myself of resentment
And every last bit of it
If I'm going to live up to the things I've written
I need to clear my mind of this anger
And all the rage that I've held near
If I'm going to live up to the words I've spoken.

But I haven't yet,
Letting go is how I can start to fight my way
Out of this trench I've dug
In this war against myself
But I haven't yet.

Don't catch me at the wrong time
Or you will feel my wrath
The one I wished I never had.

I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
But I fear it will never leave me.
But I fear it will never leave me.

I need to rid myself of resentment
And every last bit of it
If I'm going to live up to the things I've written
I need to clear my mind of this anger
And all the rage that I've held near
If I'm going to live up to the words I've spoken.

Letting go, just let it go
I know.
I know.

I know I need to let go
Of everything that has
Ever made me think of myself better
I'm not better than anyone else
Of anything that's filled me with anger
That I have taken out on everyone else.

These demons will never leave me
I can only find ways to not let them out
These demons will never leave me
But I control them
Not the other way around.

So this is where it ends, the road we took together
Turn another page, however and forever
We only got one chance, the seconds are fading
Under the moonlight, we're wishing the same thing
I wanna remember, remember this moment
Remember this moment, remember this moment

Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand

'Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories
'Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

Another line begins, I wonder what comes after
Knew we'd be the same, or be in different chapters
We only got one chance before it's all over
Under the moonlight I want you to hold on
We're gonna remember, remember this moment
Remember this moment, remember this moment

Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand

'Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories
'Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

This is it, we're never getting that back
I'll admit I'll always become partly hers
(One last night to remember)
This is it, we're never getting that back
I'll admit I'll always become partly hers
(Let's take this world together, now)

Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand

Regenerate, regenerate, we've returned to reclaim

I miss the stable ground
We're waiting faces down
In a world that's sinking
I think this world and the stars
Aren't in each other's arms
In this world that's sinking

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together, we will regroup

Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change

We're searching for a cure
'Cause our world is drowning
We're quick to guard our hearts
Forget we share our scars
In this world that's drowning

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know

Why condemn when you can confide?
Why condemn when you can confide?
You're all just too busy picking a side

Why condemn when you can confide?

Why condemn when you can confide?
Regenerate, regenerate this life

What's the addiction here? Your taste for the insincere
Disposable heart and you keep wanting more
The world at your fingertips but you can't get enough of it
Disposable heart that you just can't ignore

And I'm thinking that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change
And it leaves me wandering

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
Till the next one shows up, up
You're gonna be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

They're all replaceable, in your head you chase the whole
Illusion that they give you all that you need
But you're never satisfied, empty and lost inside
You'll come to find that it's all temporary

And I'm thinking that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change
And it leaves me wondering

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
Till the next one shows up, up
You're gonna be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

I'll tear it down
I'll tear it down

You flew way too high, way too close to the sun
Feel the power that you're falling from above
Another tale of failed ambition
Greed and wealth feeding your addiction

What's it like to wear a crown of dirt
Selling all those lies with a stupid smirk
What's it like to live the life of greed
Buying everything that you want in play

Don't get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

(I'll tear it down) Kingdom built on lies
(You know it won't) Stand the test of time
(I'll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won't stand for a lifetime
(I'll tear it down) Kingdom of demise
(You're know it won't) Stand the test of time
(I'll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won't stand for a lifetime

Wings took you up
But your selfish and you don't know when to stop
Keep repeating the failed ambition
Affluence fueling your dependence
What's it like to wear a rusted crown
When you know your name will never resound
What's it like to be king for a day
When you know they won't even remember your face

Don't get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

(I'll tear it down) Kingdom built on lies
(You know it won't) Stand the test of time
(I'll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won't stand for a lifetime
(I'll tear it down) Kingdom of demise
(You're know it won't) Stand the test of time
(I'll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won't stand for a lifetime

You know you did this to yourself
Your only focus was on your wealth
Now you flew too close to the sun
You're outdone now I'm gonna break you down

Overthrow the crown
Now I'm gonna break you down
Overthrow the crown
Overthrow the crown

(I'll tear it down) Kingdom built on lies
(You know it won't) Stand the test of time
(I'll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won't stand for a lifetime
(I'll tear it down) Kingdom of demise
(You're know it won't) Stand the test of time
(I'll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won't stand for a lifetimee

I'll tear it down, Kingdom built on lies
I'll tear it down, crown of filth you built
I'll tear it down, kingdom of demise
I'll tear it down, crown of filth you built fell down

We've been living in the shadows everyday
Are we every gonna learn from our mistakes?
Our innocence, our ignorance were lost but they'll be found
The innocence of years we spent

I remember the day, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?

We've been given all these chances everyday
Another step to take in this could change
Our innocence, our ignorance were lost but they'll be found
The innocence of years we spent

I remember the day, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?

Even though it's not the same
Remember when we made our first steps
It's always just a thought away
Holding on to never forget
I still feel it now

I remember the days, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?

If I was a writer, I'd write my opinions

Just to see how wrong I could be

If I was a painter, I'd paint all my rainbows
in different colors, or probably just black and grey

If I was a writer, I'd write my opinions
And send them a letter
Just to see they listen to me and I say

Trial and error, I'm not sure I've been here before
I'm drowning in humans, I'm not sure I've been here before

If I was a writer, I'd write my opinions

Ich bin ganz klar gegen Nazis - ohne jede Diskussion
Es gibt für braune Scheiße keine Legitimation
Rechts ist keine Meinung, sondern hirnlos, dummer Müll
Keine Fußbreit den Faschisten, scheißegal, wie laut sie brüllen

Keine Toleranz für Nazis, keine Akzeptanz für Hass
Für Verharmlosung im Alltag und Beschönigung keinen Platz
Faschos gegenübertreten, jeden Tag und überall
Immer wieder Zeichen setzen, gegen rechts - auf jeden Fall

Ich bin ganz klar gegen Nazis und ich beziehe Position
Ich sage: Weg mit brauner Scheiße, ganz ohne jede Diskussion

Keinen Platz für Nationalstolz, Schopenschauer schrieb wie's ist:
Herkunft ist gar keine Leistung, darauf stolz zu sein ist Mist
Keinen Bock auf Patriotismus, scheiß auf Fahnenwedelei
Scheiß auf Farben oder Hymnen, oder auf Deutschtümelei

Keinen Platz für Rechtsextreme und für braune Theorie
Keinen Raum für Vorurteile, Fremdenfeindlichkeit geht nie
Darum ganz klar gegen Nazis im alltäglichen Geschwätz
Auf der Strasse, in der S-Bahn, in der Kneipe und im Netz

Ich bin ganz klar gegen Nazis und ich beziehe Position
Ich sage: weg mit brauner Scheiße, ganz ohne jede Diskussion

Oh - ich scheiß' auf Nazis

Ich bin ganz klar gegen Rassismus, überall und zweifelsfrei
Keinen Bock auf dumme Witze, denn hier ist der Spaß vorbei
Und ganz klar gegen Chauvinismus, gegen Frauenfeindlichkeit
gegen prolligen Sexismus und Voreingenommenheit

Ganz klar gegen Schwulenhass und gegen Homophobie
Jeder Mensch liebt wen er lieben will, egal ob Ihn, Es oder Sie
Und gegen scheiß Gleichmacherei von ANTIFA und rechtsextrem
Wer den Unterschied nicht schnall, hat ein Intelligenzproblem

Ich bin ganz klar gegen Nazis und ich beziehe Position
Ich sage: weg mit brauner Scheiße, ganz ohne jede Diskussion

Wir sind ganz klar gegen Nazis - ganz klar gegen Nazis

Ooh, you feel the hunter's gaze
A shadow even in the dark of night
Scheming your early grave

He's going to leave you dead or dying
Draining all the blood he craves
You never thought you'd be meat for the market
What'd you expect when you sold your name

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

Ooh, when courage takes it's hold
You face down all the would-be masters
And break the ties that bind your goals

This is gonna be the moment
Your blood wakes and fills your veins
Stand tall with your strength, defy them
Become your own fate

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

Who stands the storm and faces
The horrors that darkness breeds?
Who will take the life they're given
And cast light for all to see?

Who stands the storm if not the brave?
Whats built from cowards that we praise?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again

You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

We spent a decade building
A band of brothers to the bone
And it showed

From the reef's kiss calling
To the resistance rise we rose
We walked through fire blind
The march echoes for all time

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming
Storm or calm alike

We are the humble phalanx
To raise the arrogance in foes
And it showed

We found a fraud in a bishop
And built a nation of flawed sons
We walked through fire blind
The march echoes for all time

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming
Storm or calm alike

And though my vessels lone-manned with brazen broken hull
The waves will never take an
Armored archer core
Armored archer core

A means to believe
A reverie I couldn't reach
Never made a difference to me

Go on, our brother
You've only just begun
Live long with honor
From our fire you are born

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming
Storm or calm alike

And though my vessels lone-manned with brazen broken hull
The waves will never take an
Armored archer core

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide (The turning tide)

I watch the wonder creeping over all the walls we've made,
(A tragic sly cascade)
And I watch it flood away the light from any candle's flame,
(With wick entwined of late)
Can't keep a fire in rain.

And the worst of it all is that you know me,
And you know that I will fall for it every time,
When we collide it's death to rights.

Sooner or later we will find new winds to carry home,
(The hearts we turned to stone)
And i pray theyre strong enough to weather gems from cindered coal,
(That you have left to smoke)
Burned out before the stoke.

And the worst of it all is that you know me,
And you know that I will fall for it every time,
When we collide it's death to rights.

How many will we leave wondering?
How many will we leave wondering?

It starts we never finish and ends we never start,
How many lives will break upon our callous hearts,
Will break upon our callous hearts.

And the worst of it all is that you know me,
And you know that I will fall for it every time,
When we collide it's death to rights.

Pull back the curtain
The one behind it has a different face
The inner workings
The gears are turning at a different pace

Time will change us all

The more that you question
The more the answers aren't what you want to hear

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time
Of time
The years wasted, persuaded to smile when it feels so wrong inside

Honesty or deception?
You can only hide it for so long
But we choose to be silent
Stick to the story

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time

How can we let ourselves
Continue this routine
The artificial beat
Of a heart that's long since ceased

I'm watching them all fly by,
Reaching the greatest heights my dreams find,
I'm needing first a leap to climb.

I await the day the stars won't seem so far away,
And greet a sun the darkened clouds have kept at bay,
But until then, until then.

My wings they unfold in a storming gale,
The tempest calls for my flight to fail,
When gravity beckons with its hold,
In spite of 'all the horizon sends winds to take me home.

I'll build my throne from broken bones,
Defeats I've known and deeds ive left untold,
My story is the storm.

I await the day the stars won't seem so far away,
And greet a sun the darkened clouds have kept at bay,
But until then, until then.

My wings they unfold in a storming gale,
The tempest calls for my flight to fail,
When gravity beckons with its hold,
In spite of 'all the horizon sends winds to take me home.

I've seen them shine seen them rise and fall,
Yet kept my course and fared through it all.

No thought is given to the consequence,
Just a need to see what might become,
It's like we need to sabotage all of the love in our lives to prove control is so far from undone.

And I,
I have caved in again but I,
I'm building from the wreckage.

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal,
The toll it takes in time revealed.

I choose the shot to usher in deliverance,
Flood away the past I can't tow,
But like the river weathers stone it shapes and withers my home,
To a place I barely know.

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal,
The toll it takes in time revealed,
The trial in wake of it creates or tears us down,
We bend, we break, we learn to heal.

Failings are clay for mason hands to shape,
So strike away the grip of past mistakes.

And I,
I have caved in again but I,

Angel, you have wings, to fly, fly to me.
Angel, do you doubt? No need to have doubts.

Angel, feel my love, my love for you, feel my love for you.
Angel, carry me, to you, to your home, to paradise.
Angel, I would lie for you, for you, just for you, with my yearning heart.
And angel, I would die for you, for you, just for you, with my burning heart.

Angel, don't feel liable for me and my pain, don't feel liable.
'Cause angels must be free, high up from this world in eternity.

There are two types of men on our Mother Earth
Some have all the luck, some just live in dirt
Here are several types of the color of the skin
But what's crucial is to lose or win

You feel so alive where the eagles cry
And you feel so strong on a mountain high
But in fact you are at his bottom just
His unattainable top seems to be a must

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

And the rain keeps knocking on our Mother Earth
And the snow keeps falling, is it really worth
To live through this ache and to die at last
When you're predestined and the die is cast?

Our thoughts are fading in a time that melts
Our flesh is fading as we've always felt
But we kid ourselves to meet heaven's feast
To rise up to God and to be released

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

You belong to us, to the human crap
Which will never win and succumbs in traps
That are set by others with deceitfulness
And you stumble into them with thankfulness

No one knows if we are to survive the storm
But I tell you man you are just a worm
Just a little error on a hopeless crust
You're sleazy man and your limbs will rust

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

"Kinder euer Hoheit, grässliche Kreaturen, furchtbar... furchtbar tückisch! ... aber Ausländer natürlich!"

Child do not ask me to decide
'Cause it's me who can tell you
How hard it is to live
'Cause it's me who can tell you
How hard it is to give

Without any reason, without any sense
Without any reason, without any sense
Without any reason, without any sense
Without any reason, without any sense

Embryodead you are condemned
Don't attempt to exist in this world full of hate

Christ, he didn't know, he was condemned
Christ, he didn't know, with God's intend
Christ, he didn't know, he had the will
Christ, he didn't know, he saw the hill

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha

Christ had died at last, he gave the most
Christ had died at last, the holy ghost
Christ had died at last, he had the will
Christ had died at last, he saw the hill

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all...

Oh Christ, oh Christ, you were condemned
To die on Roman's cross at end
Pilatus he had not the will
To send the right man to the hill
So he was nailed like ugly scum
To trunks of shame the carpenters done
And he screamed out "I had the will,
But father left me on the hill"

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha

Oh Christ, you are a lunatic
Oh Christ, you're just a lunatic
Go on, scream out you had the will
To die for us upon the hill

Golgotha
Golgotha

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha

Here in the dark
Is no light at all,
No orientation,
No shadows fall.

Here in the dark
I reach out for you,
Sensing fear.
Have I lost you?

Is it you?
Is it you?

I see no way out.
I just hear your voice.
It seems so dead, too cold for you,
Too cold for you to be alive.

I hesitate
To trust your voice.
Sounds so unreal,
It sounds like if somebody forces you.

Is it you?
Is it you?

My hand stretches out,
Now I feel your hand.
It is motionless.
Oh my god, it's dead!

The light is on now,
The Devil jeers at me.
He drags your corpse across barbed hooks
And takes away my soul with laughter.

Is it you?
Is it you?

Is it you?
Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?

And suddenly there was war
We didn't remember it
A long time forgotten
There suddenly was war

And suddenly there was war
Our children are dead
Burnt in the ruins
That were left by war

War!
War!
War!
War!

War!
War!
War!
War!

And suddenly there was war
And the mothers, they screamed
For revenge and reprisals
For another war

And suddenly
And suddenly

And suddenly there was war
With spoiling and death
And you fight alone
If there's another war

Whole life is war
Your life is pain
And you will fight alone
In your personal war

War!
War!
War!
War!

This is war!

Holy burning hand of wrath
Piercing forever through the heart

And this flaming orbit of shame
Ravages and splits the past

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Wreath of barbs

The injection of religion
Has a comalike effect
And bodies lay in decay
Dreaming of a greener day

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Grinding, binding, taking away
Grinding, binding, taking away

Away

Open eyes, reading nothing
A sky harsh blue grins black
A sky harsh blue grins black
And I bleedm and bleed in this wreath of barbs
And I runm and run but I don't get far, don't get far, don't get far

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Wreath of barbs
Wreath of barbs

Cold wind in your hair
Sitting on a true green chair
But your thought will run around again
Feel like unreal

Try more a hand can hold
The taste of self-confidence so far
But you don't realize
You remove to a wrap

To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap

I see you crash down
In a sea of decline
I see you crash down
Toxicated you are mine

Enclosed by a storm you can't return from the wrap [the trap]

(You no good dirty son of a bitch)

(Move! Get outta the way!)

I am your love
I am your hate
All this and more
For me and my whore

Make me lie down
And beg like a dog
Whip my behind
If I should do wrong

(Oh, you bastard)
(O-oh, you bastard)

Follow me 'round
Until I get lost
Then pull back my chain
And show me who's boss

Don't be afraid
No need for this shit
You're my private nurse
This won't hurt a bit

Pull back my skin
And stick me with pins
Move closer to me

(Oh, you bastard)
(You dirty bastard, did you think I'll ever let you touch me there?)

Twist my insides
Blind both my eyes
Pull my guts out
I swear I won't shout

Twist my insides
Blind both my eyes
Pull my guts out
I swear I won't shout!

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and
Even in the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud
The eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind
The sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings
Create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land
Feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time
A thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears
We stand surrounded by a million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say
Is in the pill you took today

In the year 4545
Ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you

In the year 5555
Your arms are hanging limp at your sides
You legs got nothing to do
Some machine doing that for you

In the year 6565
Ain't gonna need no husband, won't need no wife
You'll pick your son, pick your daughter too
From the bottom of a long glass tube, whoa-oh

In the year 7510
If God's a-comin', he ought to make it by then
Maybe he'll look around himself and say
"Guess it's time for the Judgement Day!"

In the year 8510
God is gonna shake his mighty head
He'll either say, "I'm pleased, where man has been"
Or tear it down and start again, whoa-oh

In the year 9595
I'm kinda wondering, if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old Earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing, whoa-oh

Now it's been ten thousand years
Man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew
Now man's reign is through
But through eternal night
The twinkling of starlight
So very far away
Maybe it's only yesterday

In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies...

Es ist der erste Sonnenstrahl
Der die Nacht mit einem Schlag vergessen macht
Ich genieße den Morgen mit all seiner Pracht
Das hab ich mir nicht ausgedacht

Wenn der Tag mich so küsst
Frag ich nicht nach dem Sinn
Denk nicht mehr drüber nach
Ich nehm das einfach so hin

Doch eh ich mich verseh'
Sind die Schatten wieder lang
Und ich frage mich
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?

Ich will keine Zeit verschenken
An morgen werde ich heut nicht denken
Ich setze mich in's Auto und ich fahre ans Meer
Und so ungefähr

Der Tag hält was er verspricht
Ich hab nur Augen für Dich
Wir gehen Hand in Hand
Sonnenuntergang

Doch eh ich mich verseh'
Sind die Schatten wieder lang
Und ich frage mich
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?
Warum, sind schöne Tage so schnell um?

Wait in line
Till your time
Ticking clock
Everyone stop

Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me

Do you believe

There doesn't seem to be anybody else who agrees with me

Do you believe
In what you see
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe in
What you see

Nine to five
Living lies
Everyday
Stealing time
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
Everyone's taking everything they can

Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line

And I'll shout and I'll scream
But I'd rather not be seen
And I'll hide away for another day

Do you believe
In what you see
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see

Everyone's saying different things to me

Do you believe in heaven above?
Do you believe in love?
Don't tell a lie
Don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you

Open fire on my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defences are down
A kiss or a frown?
Can't survive on my own

And if a girl walks in
And carves her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do (don't know what to do)
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel

It's on your mind (but you can't say it)
It's in your eyes (but you can't see it)
It's on your wrist (but you can't time it)
It's off the top of your head (but you can't wear it)

It's in your face
It's in your hands
It's in the air (but you can't breathe it)
You're not the one I used to know

Gone to your head...

It's up your nose (but you can't snort it)
It's down your throat (but you can't suck it)
It's on your lap (but you can't have it)
It's in your reach (but you can't grab it)

It's in your face
It's in your hands
It's in the air (but you can't breathe it)
You're not the one I used to know

And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know

And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know

Gone to your head...

Gone to your head...

Gone to your head...

(It's in your head!)

It's a real thing
Safety's off
Are you there?
Are you there for me?
By my side
An angel
Who dodge the bullets wide

It feels right
On a beach when you talk
You talk without a sound
And when you walk
Your feet hardly touch the ground

But you're there by my side
But you're there for me

When all this is over
Heaven knows I'm going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

It wears off
Like lipstick on your skin
Like a day that won't begin
Waking up
And you can't remember
Where you've been

But you're there by my side
But you're there for me

When all this is over
Heaven knows I'm going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

When all this is over
Heaven knows I'm going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

It's time
We get things straight
Are you there?
Are you there for me?
Back for good
At 6 AM in Hollywood

When all this is over
Heaven knows I'm going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

When all this is over
Heaven knows I'm going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

I see you out on the dancefloor shaking around
I see you out on an empty beach
I see you walking a one way street
It's the same as always

A star
Maybe you are

Maybe you are

A new Madonna

In a way I can hear myself say
What is it worth?
I say we meet on the last place on Earth
It's insane as always

A star
Maybe you are

Guys are drooling over you
Sampling your soul
You could be the chosen one
But what if
Everything they say is wrong
And you die some?

Everlasting teenage recoil
Fall in love with anything
Come undone with hearts unbroken
And wish upon a lucky star

Sometimes you feel so skinny
It's like you don't even exist
Lolita never been kissed

You gotta feel what can be felt
Touch what can be touched
Do what can be done
But don't

You got zip to lose

Es sollte ein Abschied sein
Von der Ungerechtigkeit
Kein Hilfeschrei
Ganz auf dich allein gestellt
Gibt es nichts was dich aufhält
Dein Ziel steht fest

Es ist nie falsch
Das Richtige zu tun
Es gibt nur wenig
Wofür es sich zu leben lohnt

Es ist nie falsch
Das Richtige zu tun
Nur noch Sekunden
Und trotzdem zu spät

Es liegt nur an dir selbst
Ob du den Druck aushältst
Du gibst nicht auf
Sobald das Uhrwerk tickt
Brauchst du mehr als nur Glück
Kein Weg zurück

Es ist nie falsch
Das Richtige zu tun
Es gibt nur wenig
Wofür es sich zu leben lohnt

Es ist nie falsch
Das Richtige zu tun
Nur noch Sekunden
Und trotzdem zu spät

Es gibt kein zweites Leben
Nur das eine was du lebst
Es ist nicht wichtig
Was zerstört wird
Sondern was dabei entsteht
Was dabei entsteht

Es ist nie falsch
Das Richtige zu tun
Es gibt nur wenig
Wofür es sich zu leben lohnt

Es ist nie falsch
Das Richtige zu tun
Nur noch Sekunden
Und trotzdem zu spät
Und trotzdem zu spät
Und trotzdem zu spät

Europa macht es vor
Wir bleiben unter uns
Und feiern den Erfolg
Es bleibt dabei
Da könnt ihr ewig warten

Weil hier die Sonne scheint
In Freiheit leben
Und im Wohlstand nur für uns
Gibt's ein Problem,
Dann schicken wir Soldaten

Kein Grund zur Sorge

Was interessiert es uns
Was so weit weg geschieht
Es stört uns nicht
Weil es uns nicht betrifft
Habt ihr gedacht
Dass Mitleid glücklich macht

Der Weg ins Paradies
Ist zum Greifen nah
Wenn du ihn überlebst
Was sind den schon
6000 gegen x Millionen

Denn sie kommen nicht weit
Wir sind in Sicherheit
Und unsere Autos auch
Und es ist klar
Dass es für immer so bleibt

Kein Grund zur Sorge

Was interessiert es uns
Was so weit weg geschieht
Es stört uns nicht
Weil es uns nicht betrifft
Habt ihr gedacht
Dass Mitleid glücklich macht

Und der Aufschrei
Der Betroffenheit
Weicht schon morgen
Der Zufriedenheit

Während wir uns
In leere Worte betten
Werden die Flüchtlinge
Im Stacheldraht verrecken
Noch mehr Gitter, noch mehr Zäune

Spendenquittung
Nur keine Verpflichtung
Dahinter die vergessenen Träume
Du wirst es sehen
Es wird schon alles gut gehen

Kein Grund zur Sorge

Was interessiert es uns
Was so weit weg geschieht
Es stört uns nicht
Weil es uns nicht betrifft
Habt ihr gedacht
Dass Mitleid glücklich macht

Wenn sich die letzte Tür verschließt
In der Stadt aus Stahlbeton
Verliert die Wut den Ausgangspunkt
Und nur die Richtung bleibt verschwommen

Es sind nur leere Wände da
Schon bald verfallen sie zu Staub
Denn das Schauspiel setzt sich fort bis
Wir die alten Rechnungen zahlen

Die Welt aus dem Gleichschritt bringen
Ein letztes Stück und wir sind mittendrin
Aber erst wenn die Tränen getrocknet sind

Und mit Siegessicherheit
Treten wir den Rückzug an
Und wenn alle Lichter ausgehen
Haben wir noch nicht gewonnen

Wenn die Verträge fertig sind
Bricht uns die Theorie zusammen
Wie ein Kartenhaus im Wind und
Das Fundament steht schon in Flammen

Die Welt aus dem Gleichschritt bringen
Ein letztes Stück und wir sind mittendrin
Aber erst wenn die Tränen getrocknet sind

Alles was früher war
Stört erst
In ein paar Jahren

Die Welt aus dem Gleichschritt bringen
Ein letztes Stück und wir sind mittendrin
Aber erst wenn die Tränen getrocknet sind

Und wir sind mittendrin
Aber erst wenn die Tränen getrocknet, die Trümmer versteckt
Und die Hoffnung vergessen sind

Nur ein Gesicht, nur eine Zahl, nur eine Name auf Papier
Nur ein Gefahrenpotential, ein schlechtes Polaroid von dir
Nur ein Kunde, Mitgliedsnummer, keine Ahnung was du bist
Ein Börsenmakler oder vielleicht Terrorist?

Aber irgendwann hau ich ab, dann bin ich weg
Und ihr kriegt eine Postkarte von mir zugeschickt
Aber irgendwann geht es los, dann bin ich weg
Und ihr kriegt eine Postkarte von mir zugeschickt

Nur ein Gerücht, nur ein Symbol, nur eine neue Mastercard
Die Unterschrift fürs Protokoll, weil dein Vermieter dich verklagt
Ein Aktenzeichen, gute Noten, weiße Weste nur für dich
Guter Verlierer der die Regeln niemals bricht

Aber irgendwann hau ich ab, dann bin ich weg
Und ihr kriegt eine Postkarte von mir zugeschickt
Aber irgendwann geht es los, dann bin ich weg
Und ihr kriegt eine Postkarte von mir zugeschickt

Lass uns diese Stadt endlich verlassen
Ein letzter Blick zurück und wir sind die Sorgen los

Aber irgendwann hauen wir ab, dann sind wir weg
Und ihr kriegt eine Postkarte von uns zugeschickt
Aber irgendwann geht es los, dann sind wir weg
Wir sehen uns niemals wieder, denn wir kommen nie mehr zurück

Es ist nicht mal richtig kalt
Und trotzdem friert mein Atem ein
Ich hätt dir wirklich früher sagen sollen
Dass du das letzte Stück alleine gehst
Die Bilder von dir wirken friedlich, nett und irgendwie verletzt
Und doch nicht echt

Glaubst du immer noch dass irgendjemand kommt
Der hier die Scherben zusammenfegt
Glaubst du wirklich du hättest noch die Wahl
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn
(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn
(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn

Und es lässt mich nicht mehr los
Der Gedanke hält mich fest
Vielleicht hab ich auch erst jetzt gemerkt
Wie wichtig es mir ist, dass es dich gibt
Immer wieder frag ich mich, warum denn ausgerechnet jetzt
Und du hast Recht

Glaubst du immer noch dass irgendjemand kommt
Der hier die Scherben zusammenfegt
Glaubst du wirklich du hättest noch die Wahl
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn
(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn
(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn

Und deine Freunde haben es immer schon gesagt
Doch du hast nie auf sie gehört
Ich würde dir so gern erzählen
Dass jetzt alles besser ist
Von Sympathie und vollen Sälen
Doch kann ich's leider nicht

(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn
(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn
(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Zwischen bleiben oder gehn
Trotzdem sehe ich dich nicht
(Du bist mir viel zu nah)
Je länger ich hier sitze
Desto schlechter fühl ich mich
Desto schlechter fühl ich mich

Wahrscheinlich ist es schon zu spät
Es war schon länger abzusehen
Dass es auseinander geht
So schnell kann der Wind sich drehen

Wo sind all die Zweifel
Die dir so furchtbar wichtig waren?
Warum hast du alles verloren
Was ich an dir bewundert hab?

Das letzte bisschen Freundschaft
Die Zeit als wir unsterblich waren
Nur noch ein Fotoalbum
Ohne Daten ohne Zahlen

Auf der Suche nach der Wahrheit
Belügen sich die meisten Menschen selbst
Dann schlägt die Wucht des Aufpralls unerwartet ein
Erst wenn der letzte Vorhang fällt bist Du allein

Es war so ein langer Weg
Und doch nicht lang genug für uns
Aber das Einzige was zählt
Ist dein allerletzter Wunsch

Sag mir was du hören willst
Und ich erzähle dir
Von Vertrauen in leere Worte
Und wie man es verliert

Weniger die Enttäuschung
Sondern vielmehr der Versuch
Ein Stück von dem zu retten
Was sich nicht zu retten lohnt

Auf der Suche nach der Wahrheit
Belügen sich die meisten Menschen selbst
Dann schlägt die Wucht des Aufpralls unerwartet ein
Erst wenn der letzte Vorhang fällt bist Du allein

Dann schlägt die Wucht des Aufpralls unerwartet ein
Erst wenn der letzte Vorhang fällt bist Du allein

Es ist so leicht zu ignorieren
Wenn sie schon wieder aufmaschieren
und wieder sagen alle sie hätten nichts gewusst
Von national befreiten Zonen und dem Asylbeschluss

Wenn so viel schweigen müssen wir noch lauter schreien
und noch mehr schreien, damit und trotzdem jemand hört
Wenn so viele schweigen, müssen wir noch lauter schreien
Du bist nicht allein, es liegt jetzt nur an Dir und mir
Denn es liegt nur an Dir und mir
Es liegt jetzt nur an Dir und mir

Wie lange wollt ihr noch zu sehen? Bis ihr das überhaupt versteht?
Rostock, Hoyerswerda auch wenn es niemand gern erwähnt
So vertreten echte Deutsche ihre Nationalität

Wenn so viele schweigen, müssen wir noch lauter schreien
Und noch mehr schreien, damit uns trotzdem jemand hört
Wenn so viele schweigen, müssen wir noch lauter schreien
Du bist nicht allein, es liegt jetzt nur an Dir und mir
Denn es liegt nur an Dir und mir
Es liegt jetzt nur an Dir und mir

Denn die Welt steht nicht still und es wird langsam Zeit
Dass hier endlich was passiert denn wir sind das Wegschauen leid
Wir sind nicht die ersten und werden sicher nicht die letzten sein
Die sich dem Wahnsinn in den Weg stellen und wir sind nicht allein

Wenn so viele schweigen, müssen wir noch lauter schreien
Und noch mehr schreien, damit uns trotzdem jemand hört
Wenn so viele schweigen, müssen wir noch lauter schreien
Du bist nicht allein, es liegt jetzt nur an Dir und mir

Wenn so viele schweigen, müssen wir noch lauter schreien
Und noch mehr schreien, damit uns trotzdem jemand hört

In this society the opportunity to use your right free speech
Now an then is getting lost in clouds of tear gas
Is this the kind of government you are looking for?
Just close eyes but the injustice won't fade out

Get a move on
If that's what your democracy looks like...
We have got to move on

It is a tragedy, of this "democracy"
The goal:a positive change your answer is a punch in my face
Faced by unscrupulous cops beating us up, putting us in prison
We have to cut our losses. Fight back and that is our protest

But oppression breeds resistance and resistance is what we need
Despite police brutality we will defend our right to speak
We have got to fight for more

Sie kamen früh morgens
Und traten seine Tür ein
Sie waren fünf
Und er allein

Er versucht sich noch zu wehren
Schon war es vorbei
Keine Zivilcourage
Niemand der zur Hilfe eilt

Alles was er wollte
War ohne Angst zu leben
Und in diesem Land zu wohnen
Gefesselt wir ein Schwerverbrecher
Tritt er die Reise an
Ein profitables Geschäft für die Lufthansa

Kein Mensch ist illegal
Es gibt kein Gesetz, das daran etwas ändern kann
Kein Mensch ist illegal
Weil bisher jede Grenze, jede Grenze irgendwann verschwand

Was sind das für Menschen?
Die dazu fähig sind?
Warum bezahl ich sie?
Mit meinen Steuern

Nützliche Arbeitskräfte
Sind bei uns willkommen
Alle anderen unerwünscht
Unerwünscht

Kurz vor dem Start
Bäumt er sich auf
Er schreit noch einmal um Hilfe
Vier Hände pressen ihn runter
Bis er aufhört zu atmen

Kein Mensch ist illegal
Es gibt kein Gesetz, das daran etwas ändern kann
Kein Mensch ist illegal
Weil bisher jede Grenze, jede Grenze irgendwann verschwand

Wo sind eure Menschenrechte?
Die ihr so arrogant auf eure Fahnen schreibt
Wo sind eure Menschenrechte?
Für jemand ohne diese verdammte Wort im Pass

Ich mach da nicht mehr mit!

Das ist das tägliche Spiel
Zwischen Gut und Böse
Komm bleib schön friedlich
Die Würfel rollen
Ob es dir gefällt oder nicht
So sind die Regeln
Zeit zu verlieren
Und du weißt genau dass du nicht
Der Gewinnertyp bist
Wo bleibt dein Einsatz? Gibt's du schon auf?
Wenn du aussteigen willst, bist du erledigt
Hast du noch etwas? leg noch was drauf
Das große Glück liegt einen
Schritt von dir entfernt
Komm hör' schon auf zu
Jammern hier kriegt
Jeder seine Chance
Und wer dann nocht nicht
Zufrieden ist, bekommt sein
Geld zurück. Kopf hoch
Und bitte nicht mehr traurig
Sein, das nächste Los
Gewinnt bestimmt - Versprochen
Jetzt wird alles gut - denn du bist dabei.
Nur gewinnen, nur gewinnen
Und dann verlieren.

Im Bett ist der Mensch nicht gern allein
Und in meinem Bett ist grad' noch Platz für dich
Doch mein Alter ist fast jeden Tag zu Hause
Und ich glaub', er hat was gegen dich
Für mich ist die Welt nicht mehr in Ordnung
Nicht früh um sieben und auch nicht abends nach der Tagesschau
Fuer mich heißt das Wort zum Sonntag "Scheiße"
Und das Wort zum Montag "Mach mal blau"

Wir müssen hier raus
Das ist die Hölle
Wir leben im Zuchthaus
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind zwei von Millionen, wir sind nicht allein
Und wir werden es schaffen - wir werden es schaffen!

Mein Alter sagt, die Welt wird sich nicht ändern
Dabei weiss er ganz genau, was läuft
Doch er glaubt, er vergißt die ganze Scheiße
Wenn er abends in der Kneipe hängt und säuft
Er sagt, der schönste Platz ist immer an der Theke
Da hat er recht, zuhaus' ist kaum noch Platz für drei
Darum bin ich auch den ganzen Tag auf Arbeit
Man kann sagen, ich bin so frei

Wir müssen hier raus
Das ist die Hölle
Wir leben im Zuchthaus
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind zwei von Millionen, wir sind nicht allein
Und wir werden es schaffen - wir werden es schaffen
Wir werden es schaffen!

Und was kann uns hindern
Kein Geld, keine Waffen
Wenn wir es wollen
Wir werden es schaffen
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
Wir sind zwei von Millionen, wir sind nicht allein
Wir sind geboren, um frei zu sein
wir sind 60 Millionen, wir sind nicht allein

Ich suche wirklich nach einer Erklärung
Um diese Gefühle zu beschreiben die ich habe
Es kam am U- Bhf. an, früher als ich erwartete
Ich saß lange Zeit wartend da
Nicht fähig zu reden oder mich zu bewegen
Manchmal scheint dein Leben frustrierend, aber ich denke das ist es nicht
Was du hast ist, was du verdammt noch mal besitzt
Und ich weiß es gibt manche Leute denen ich vertrauen kann
Wei0t du, ich will meine Freunde nicht verlieren
Jeden einzelnen Tag bin ich erschöpft
Wirst du bis zum ende bleiben , und vielleicht noch länger?
Ein einer Welt voller Alienation , fühlt sich nichts mehr vertraut an
Habe keinen Hinweis auf meine Bestimmung
Alles was ich will ist diese Freunde zu sehen
Wenn ich meinen Weg gehe
Und ich weiß es gibt manche Leute denen ich vertrauen kann
Siehst du es nicht? Bist du blind? Das ist wichtig für mich
Was ist richtig? Was ist falsch? Wie kann ich verdammt noch mal frei sein?
Dies ist die Zweideutigkeit deines Lebens
Voll von Entschlossenheit nirgends hin zu gehen
Enttäuschung bist du ablehnst das Chaos zu sehen in dem wir stecken
Kein Rettungsplan bis jetzt
Du schließt nur die Augen bist du vergisst
Und ich weiß es gibt manche Leute denen ich vertrauen kann

Hast du dich jemals gefragt,
ob das wirklich dein Land ist?
Was heißt denn überhaupt dein Land und mein Land ?

Als ich noch klein war, hab ich immer geglaubt, dass alles so in Ordnung ist.
Die Polizisten sind da, um uns zu beschützen.
Vor den bösen Gangstern und Terroristen.
Später auf Demonstrationen musste ich bald einsehen,
dass Bullen nie versuchen Demonstranten zu verstehen.
Knüppel frei, für Pfefferspray und Staatsanwalt.

Ich gründe jetzt meinen eigenen Staat und mein Staat ist kein Staat !

Fickt euch ! Dann gibt es keine Grenzen.

Und mein Staat ist kein Staat,
ja mein Staat ist kein Staat,
denn mein Staat ist kein Staat,
keine Nazi-Bullen und keine CDU !

Ich hab euch niemals gewählt.
Ich steh für nichts wofür ihr steht.
Politik für Reiche, gegen Arme
Für die Wirtschaft, keine Frage.
Natürlich weiß ich, dass in vielen Ländern alles noch beschissener ist,
doch das nimmt mir nicht das Recht,
zu kritisieren, zu protestieren und zu ändern was zu ändern ist.

Wer gibt euch überhaupt das Recht, uns einzuzäunen ?
Ihr tut als hättet ihr die Welt gekauft und aufgeteilt.

It's 3 o'clock in the morning
And the rain begin to fall
But I know what I'm needing
But I don't have at all

I'm needing someone like you
That I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight

Outside my window
It's lonely and cold
Inside my heart there's a fire
Burning out of control

Burning for someone like you
I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight

Your love's coming to me
Like a wolf howling at the moon
But that just doesn't do me
If I can't get you soon

I'm calling for someone like you
That I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight
